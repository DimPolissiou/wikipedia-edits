It was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on April 3, 2020. It has an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance''. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, with its graphics, presentation, and gameplay receiving commendation, although criticism was directed towards its short length and pace.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Resident Evil 3'' is a remake of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', a [[survival horror]] video game released for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the remake features [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to the [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|2019 ''Resident Evil 2'' remake]]. {{anchor|Resident Evil: Resistance}}It includes an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance'', which puts a team of four players against a \"mastermind\" who can create traps, enemies, and other hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakeling |first1=Richard |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake Official Release Date On Consoles And PC Announced; RE Resistance Multiplayer Included |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212111645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The beginning of ''Resident Evil 3'' however, has players briefly controlling Jill in a [[first person perspective]], in a dream and then in her apartment, engaging with the environment around her much like the characters you assume the role of in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/641723-resident-evil-3-remake-first-person-mode-pc-ps4-xbox-one</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Raccoon City]] is thrown into chaos by a [[zombie apocalypse]] caused by an outbreak of the [[T-Virus]]. On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]] is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]] during her escape, but Brad falls to zombies while trying to save Jill. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad, who is dispatched later by Carlos. The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office for them to realize that Bard is holed up in a hospital, with Bard demanding them to retrieve him. As Tyrell traces Bard's location, Jill radios Carlos as she is attacked by a heavily mutated Nemesis in front of the city's Clock Tower. She manages to down Nemesis, but it infects her with the virus before escaping, causing her to fall unconscious. Carlos finds Jill roughly half a day later and takes her to Spencer Memorial Hospital, where they have traced Bard's location. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. After drowning in acid, Nemesis further mutates, and Jill uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roofdeck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai long enough for to Jill shoot and incapacitate him. When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an unknown figure retrieves the destroyed vaccine case from their apartment.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Palumbo |first1=Alessio |title='Resident

Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the remake features [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to the [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|2019 ''Resident Evil 2'' remake]]. {{anchor|Resident Evil: Resistance}}It includes an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance'', which puts a team of four players against a \"mastermind\" who can create traps, enemies, and other hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakeling |first1=Richard |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake Official Release Date On Consoles And PC Announced; RE Resistance Multiplayer Included |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212111645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The beginning of ''Resident Evil 3'' however, has players briefly controlling Jill in a [[first person perspective]], in a dream and then in her apartment, engaging with the environment around her much like the characters you assume the role of in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/641723-resident-evil-3-remake-first-person-mode-pc-ps4-xbox-one</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Raccoon City]] is thrown into chaos by a [[zombie apocalypse]] caused by an outbreak of the [[T-Virus]]. On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]] is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]] during her escape, but Brad falls to zombies while trying to save Jill. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad, who is dispatched later by Carlos. The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office for them to realize that Bard is holed up in a hospital, with Bard demanding them to retrieve him. As Tyrell traces Bard's location, Jill radios Carlos as she is attacked by a heavily mutated Nemesis in front of the city's Clock Tower. She manages to down Nemesis, but it infects her with the virus before escaping, causing her to fall unconscious. Carlos finds Jill roughly half a day later and takes her to Spencer Memorial Hospital, where they have traced Bard's location. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. After drowning in acid, Nemesis further mutates, and Jill uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roofdeck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai long enough for to Jill shoot and incapacitate him. When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an unknown figure retrieves the destroyed vaccine case from their apartment.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Palumbo |first1=Alessio |title='Resident

Shortly after, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that Clinton surprised many in Washington at how fast he and his [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] had moved to change that.

The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]\nChanges in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.<ref>Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, & Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.</ref>\n\nBritain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.<ref>Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.</ref> As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.<ref>[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.</ref> This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.<ref name=\"Kanbur\">{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&hid=107&sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=45526514}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&vid=11&hid=28&bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAmidst increasing criticism of Britain's colonial policies from abroad and at home,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kelvin|title=Race and Class Struggles in a Colonial State|year=1994|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWAYAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781895176438}}</ref> the commission was a performance to showcase Britain's \"benevolent\" attitude towards its colonial subjects.<ref name=Thomas267>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Roy Darrow, ed.|title=The Trinidad Labour Riots of 1937|year=1987|publisher=University of West Indies Press|location=St. Augustine|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Re3TAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}</ref> The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[World War II|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.<ref name=Thomas283>{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of \u00a35 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development.

Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).\n\nIn 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F.

This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516\u20133530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/120bb48b574483be2faedcae4e7830ad810e13d5}}</ref> In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection.

In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.\n\nThere is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.<ref name=\":18\">[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.

Hirschman]]\u2019s [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty|exit-voice-loyalty]] (EVL) model can be used to understand how certain policy changes affect the growth of a nation and the change of bargaining power inside it. Clark et al.\u2019s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country's development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.\n\nHirschman\u2019s EVL model is based on the foundation that \u201cunder any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior\u201d. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- \u201cexit\u201d or \u201cvoice\u201d. If the individual chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the \u201cvoice\u201d option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the \u201cloyalty\u201d option, which occurs when the consumer cannot \u201cexit\u201d and the firm does not care about the effect that \u201cvoice\u201d will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.\n\nClark et al.\u2019s paper takes Hirschman's EVL model and applies it to political developments inside a nation.<ref>[https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf]</ref> When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, \u201cexit\u201d can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. \u201cVoice\u201d takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. \u201cLoyalty\u201d entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.\n\nHow foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens\u2019 power of \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d and weakening the state's dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens\u2019 \u201cexit\u201d option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the \u201cvoice\u201d action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state's decision-making.\n\nAs long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents\u2019 issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.\n\n=== Effects of foreign aid in Africa. ===\nWhile most economists like [[Jeffery Sachs]] hold the view of aid as the driver for economic growth and development, others argue that aid has rather led to increasing poverty and decreasing economic growth of poor countries.<ref name=\":42\">Moyo, D.

Foreign aid is especially multifaceted in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa due to geographic barriers. Most macro foreign aid efforts fail to recognize these issues and, as Sachs argues, cause insufficient international aid and policy improvement. Sachs argues that unless foreign aid provides mechanisms that overcome geographic barriers, pandemics such as HIV and AIDS that cause traumatic casualties within regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to care millions of fatalities. \n\nFor aid to be effective and beneficial to economic development, there must be some support systems or \u2018[[wiktionary:traction|traction]]\u2019 that, will enable foreign aid to spur economic growth.<ref name=\":52\">Rahnama, M. & Fawaz, F. & Gittings, K.

Dissident economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued in the 1960s that aid is ineffective:<ref>{{Cite web| title = The sad loss of Lord Bauer| url =http://www.la-articles.org.uk/bauer.htm| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | ... an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. | Peter Bauer}}\n\nIn economics, there are two competing positions on aid. A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income [[poverty trap]] poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  \u201cthe core inputs to development \u2013 teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...\u201d (United Nations 2004).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|journal = Annual Review of Economics|volume = 7|pages = 277\u2013308|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553}}</ref> And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmerican political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:\n\n# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.\n# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.\n# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.\n\nVan de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:\n\n# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.\n# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.\n# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.\n\nIn order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29\u201363|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.<ref>Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. \u201cPublic Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.\u201d World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.\n</ref>\n\nMany [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\">[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\" />\n\nBesides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that \"development was not possible without safety\". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\">Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen</ref>\n\nAnother criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.<ref>[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409153824/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity</ref> For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\" />Additionally, although the goal in utility to provide a larger social benefit may be justified as worthy, a more ethically sourced incentive would be projects not looking for an opportunity to impose a social hierarchy through cooperation, but more-so for the sake of truly assisting recipients. The intent of cooperation is not necessarily a reason for failure, but the very nature of different aspirations towards defining virtues which exist in direct context with respective societies. In this way a disconnect may be perceived among those imposing their virtues onto ethnic groups interpreting them.\n\nThe [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}</ref> essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423498}}</ref> showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|issue=6|pages=1630\u20131666}}</ref> have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.<ref name=\":2\" /> These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833\u20131856|issue=6|pages=1833\u20131856|doi=10.1257/aer.104.6.1833}}</ref> have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.\n\nIt has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].\n\nAid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.\n\nIn some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.\n\nIn several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.\n\nIn many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.\n\nAccording to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129094236/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\">[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]</ref>\n\nA common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]\nAll of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\" />\n\nFor the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}</ref> However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |title=Italian aid not up to standard overall |access-date=2009-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102713/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.\n\nAn excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: \"This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing \"product\", results, and accountability...the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development.\"\n\nEffectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14\u201338}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== MIT based study ===\n[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:\n\n* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health\n* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks\n* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write\n* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements\n* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs\n* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting\n* suitable fertilizers\n* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]\n\n=== UK Parliamentary study ===\n\nAn inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]].

At the moment, the opposite is happening.\n* In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.\n* Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.\n* In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.\n* Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.\n* Accountable states depend on empowered citizens\n* Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid.

The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]\nChanges in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.<ref>Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, & Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.</ref>\n\nBritain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.<ref>Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.</ref> As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.<ref>[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.</ref> This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.<ref name=\"Kanbur\">{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&hid=107&sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=45526514}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&vid=11&hid=28&bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAmidst increasing criticism of Britain's colonial policies from abroad and at home,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kelvin|title=Race and Class Struggles in a Colonial State|year=1994|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWAYAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781895176438}}</ref> the commission was a performance to showcase Britain's \"benevolent\" attitude towards its colonial subjects.<ref name=Thomas267>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Roy Darrow, ed.|title=The Trinidad Labour Riots of 1937|year=1987|publisher=University of West Indies Press|location=St. Augustine|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Re3TAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}</ref> The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[World War II|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.<ref name=Thomas283>{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of \u00a35 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development.

It was designed to boost European economies shattered by [[World War II|war]] and prevent the growth of [[communism|communist]] influence.]]\nThe beginning of modern development aid is rooted in the context of Post-[[World War&nbsp;II]] and the [[Cold War]]. Launched as a large-scale aid program by the United States in 1948, the European Recovery Program, or [[Marshall Plan]], was concerned with strengthening the ties to the [[West Europe]]an states to contain the influence of the [[USSR]]. Implemented by the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the Marshall Plan also expanded its reconstruction finance to strategic parts of the Middle East and Asia.<ref name=\"Httpwwwusaidgovabout_usaidusaidhisthtml\">{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html |title=USAID: USAID History |publisher=Usaid.gov |accessdate=2011-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009131110/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 }}</ref> The rationale was well summarized in the 'Point Four Program', in which United States president [[Harry Truman]] stated the anti-communist rationale for U.S. development aid in his inaugural address of 1949, which also announced the founding of [[NATO]]:<ref name=Kanbur />\n\n:\"In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security.

Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people.\"<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html Transcript of the speech]</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program. Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).\n\nIn 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].\n\nThe volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called \"[[Third World]]\" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516\u20133530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/120bb48b574483be2faedcae4e7830ad810e13d5}}</ref> In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection.

A 1961 resolution decreed that:\n\n{{Quotation|The Committee will continue to consult on the methods for making national resources available for assisting countries and areas in the process of economic development and for expanding and improving the flow of long-term funds and other development assistance to them.|Development Assistance Committee|Mandate (1961)}}\n\n=== Critiques of development aid ===\n[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries. This cartoon, from an organization critical of the true motives of international aid, calls attention to what it perceives as a contradiction.]]Development aid is often provided by means of supporting local development aid projects. In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.\n\nThere is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.<ref name=\":18\">[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the overall policies of donors and evaluates the quality of their development aid, instead of just comparing the quantity of [[official development assistance]] given.\n\n== Extent of aid ==\n{{Development economics sidebar}}\nMost [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 28 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), or about $135&nbsp;billion in 2013. A further $15.9&nbsp;billion came from the [[European Commission]] and non-DAC countries gave an additional $9.4&nbsp;billion.

Clark et al.\u2019s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country's development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.\n\n[[Albert O. Hirschman]]\u2019s EVL model is based on the foundation that \u201cunder any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior\u201d [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- \u201cexit\u201d or \u201cvoice\u201d. If the individual in a chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the \u201cvoice\u201d option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the \u201cloyalty\u201d option, which occurs when the consumer cannot \u201cexit\u201d and the firm does not care about the effect that \u201cvoice\u201d will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.\n\nClark et al.\u2019s paper takes Hirschman's Exit-Voice-Loyalty model [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf] and applies it to political developments inside a nation. When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, \u201cexit\u201d can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. \u201cVoice\u201d takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. \u201cLoyalty\u201d entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.\n\nHow foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens\u2019 power of \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d and weakening the state's dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens\u2019 \u201cexit\u201d option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the \u201cvoice\u201d action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state's decision-making.\n\nAs long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents\u2019 issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980].

Foreign aid is especially multifaceted in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa due to geographic barriers. Most macro foreign aid efforts fail to recognize these issues and, as Sachs argues, cause insufficient international aid and policy improvement. Sachs argues that unless foreign aid provides mechanisms that overcome geographic barriers, pandemics such as HIV and AIDS that cause traumatic casualties within regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to care millions of fatalities. \n\nFor aid to be effective and beneficial to economic development, there must be some support systems or \u2018[[wiktionary:traction|traction]]\u2019 that, will enable foreign aid to spur economic growth.<ref name=\":52\">Rahnama, M. & Fawaz, F. & Gittings, K.

Dissident economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued in the 1960s that aid is ineffective:<ref>{{Cite web| title = The sad loss of Lord Bauer| url =http://www.la-articles.org.uk/bauer.htm| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | ... an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. | Peter Bauer}}\n\nIn economics, there are two competing positions on aid. A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income [[poverty trap]] poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  \u201cthe core inputs to development \u2013 teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...\u201d (United Nations 2004).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|journal = Annual Review of Economics|volume = 7|pages = 277\u2013308|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553}}</ref> And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmerican political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:\n\n# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.\n# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.\n# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.\n\nVan de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:\n\n# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.\n# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.\n# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.\n\nIn order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29\u201363|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.<ref>Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. \u201cPublic Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.\u201d World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.\n</ref>\n\nMany [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\">[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\" />\n\nBesides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that \"development was not possible without safety\". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\">Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen</ref>\n\nAnother criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.<ref>[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409153824/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity</ref> For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\" />Additionally, although the goal in utility to provide a larger social benefit may be justified as worthy, a more ethically sourced incentive would be projects not looking for an opportunity to impose a social hierarchy through cooperation, but more-so for the sake of truly assisting recipients. The intent of cooperation is not necessarily a reason for failure, but the very nature of different aspirations towards defining virtues which exist in direct context with respective societies. In this way a disconnect may be perceived among those imposing their virtues onto ethnic groups interpreting them.\n\nThe [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox?

In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423498}}</ref> showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence.

In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.<ref name=\":2\" /> These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833\u20131856|issue=6|pages=1833\u20131856|doi=10.1257/aer.104.6.1833}}</ref> have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.\n\nIt has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].\n\nAid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.\n\nIn some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.\n\nIn several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.\n\nIn many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.\n\nAccording to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129094236/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\">[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]</ref>\n\nA common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]\nAll of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\" />\n\nFor the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}</ref> However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |title=Italian aid not up to standard overall |access-date=2009-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102713/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.\n\nAn excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: \"This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing \"product\", results, and accountability...the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development.\"\n\nEffectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14\u201338}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== MIT based study ===\n[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:\n\n* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health\n* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks\n* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write\n* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements\n* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs\n* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting\n* suitable fertilizers\n* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]\n\n=== UK Parliamentary study ===\n\nAn inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]]. Her evidence to the inquiry stated that effective aid requires as much investing in relationships as in managing money. It suggests Development organisations need to change the way they work to manage better the multiple partnerships that the Accra Agenda for Action recognises is at the core of the aid business. In relation to this specific inquiry, Dr Eyben outlined the following points:<ref>[http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness 'Putting Relationships First for Aid Effectiveness'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103939/http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness |date=2011-06-04 }} Evidence Submission to the APPG Inquiry on Aid Effectiveness, Institute of Development Studies (IDS)</ref>\n\n* Achieving impact requires investing in relationships, development organisations need to support their staff to do this. At the moment, the opposite is happening.\n* In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.\n* Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.\n* In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.\n* Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.\n* Accountable states depend on empowered citizens\n* Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid. (Point made in relation to UK as evidence for UK parliamentary inquiry)\n\nThe views above are of Eyben. There were many other submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness. The final report gathered a vast amount of information from a wide range of sources to ensure a balanced perspective on the issues of aid effectiveness. The All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness can be found online and the submissions of other contributors are available upon request.\n\n<br />\n== Types of Aid ==\n\n===Private Aid===\n[[Development charities]] make up a vast web of [[non-governmental organization]]s, religious ministries, foundations, business donations and college scholarships devoted to development aid.

During the [[Late Middle Ages]] the village was owned by [[Fraubrunnen Abbey]]. After the Abbey was secularized during the [[Protestant Reformation]], Schalunen village became part of the [[Bern]]ese [[bailiwick]] of Fraubrunnen.

In 1916 the Bern-Solothurn-Bahn (now [[Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn]]) built a railway station in the village. In the 1960s the [[A1 motorway (Switzerland)|A1 motorway]] was built near the village. Both the railroad and the motorway provided easy access to the nearby cities of Bern and [[Solothurn]] and allowed commuters to settle in Schalunen. In the 1970s the Unterfeld and Holzr\u00fcti neighborhoods were built to house the growing population. By 2005 only about one quarter of all jobs in the village were in agriculture, while about half were in industry.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nSchalunen and B\u00e4tterkinden form a primary school district, while secondary school students attend classes in Fraubrunnen.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:2011-04-16-Schalunen (Foto Dietrich Michael Weidmann) 147.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Schalunen village]]\nSBefore the merger, Schalunen had a total area of {{convert|1.4|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=SFSO/> Of this area, {{convert|0.82|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 59.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|0.43|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 30.9% is forested.

During the [[Late Middle Ages]] the village was owned by [[Fraubrunnen Abbey]].  After the Abbey was secularized during the [[Protestant Reformation]], Schalunen village became part of the [[Bern]]ese [[bailiwick]] of Fraubrunnen.

In the 1960s the [[A1 motorway (Switzerland)|A1 motorway]] was built near the village.  Both the railroad and the motorway provided easy access to the nearby cities of Bern and [[Solothurn]] and allowed commuters to settle in Schalunen.  In the 1970s the Unterfeld and Holzr\u00fcti neighborhoods were built to house the growing population.
