Pearl Jam wrote and recorded ''Vitalogy'' while touring behind its previous album ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other elements making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album to date.\n\nThe album was first released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], followed by a release on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until [[Jack White]]'s 2014 album ''[[Lazaretto (album)|Lazaretto]]'' it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.<ref name=\"billboard6-18-2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6121606/jack-white-lazaretto-debuts-billboard-200-sets-vinyl-sales-record |title=Jack White's 'Lazaretto' Debuts at No. 1, Sets Vinyl Sales Record |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> Upon its CD release, ''Vitalogy'' became the second-fastest selling album in history, only behind the band's previous release ''Vs.'', selling 877,000 copies in its first week and went multi-platinum quickly.<ref name=\"latimes12-15-1994\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-15/entertainment/ca-9311_1_pearl-jam |title=Vitalogy' Makes for a Real Pearl Jam of a Seller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Philips |first=Chuck |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=December 15, 1994}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.

On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\".<ref>Reynolds, John, et al. [http://www.twofeetthick.com/2005/05/who-is-the-drummer-on-satans-bed/ \"Who is the drummer on \"Satan's Bed\"?\"].

On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled.

McCready agreed, saying, \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/> During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, \"''Vitalogy'' is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different.

(Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'', in three formats: an Expanded Version, a three-CD Deluxe Edition and a Limited Edition Collector's Boxed Set. The Expanded Version will feature three bonus tracks: the previously unreleased guitar/organ-only mix of \"[[Better Man (Pearl Jam song)|Better Man]]\"; a previously unreleased alternate take of \"[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]\" from the Vitalogy session (recorded by Brendan O'Brien); and a previously unreleased demo version of \"[[Nothingman]]\", taken from the original DAT (recorded at John and Stu's in Seattle on October 14, 1993, featuring [[Richard Stuverud]] on drums). The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of ''Vitalogy'' and ''Vs.'' with their bonus tracks and a copy of Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pearljam.com/news/vs-and-vitalogy-20th-anniversary-editions|title=''Vs.'' and ''Vitalogy'' 20th Anniversary Editions|publisher=pearljam.com|accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nThe original title for the album was ''Life''. The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The band continued its boycott against [[Ticketmaster]] during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. {{ISBN|0-306-81271-1}}, pg. 64</ref> The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.\n\nThe tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1997.</ref> Ament later said, \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| all_lyrics      = [[Eddie Vedder]].

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded ''Vitalogy'' while touring behind its previous album ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other elements making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album to date.\n\nThe album was first released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], followed by a release on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until [[Jack White]]'s 2014 album ''[[Lazaretto (album)|Lazaretto]]'' it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.<ref name=\"billboard6-18-2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6121606/jack-white-lazaretto-debuts-billboard-200-sets-vinyl-sales-record |title=Jack White's 'Lazaretto' Debuts at No. 1, Sets Vinyl Sales Record |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> Upon its CD release, ''Vitalogy'' became the second-fastest selling album in history, only behind the band's previous release ''Vs.'', selling 877,000 copies in its first week and went multi-platinum quickly.<ref name=\"latimes12-15-1994\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-15/entertainment/ca-9311_1_pearl-jam |title=Vitalogy' Makes for a Real Pearl Jam of a Seller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Philips |first=Chuck |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=December 15, 1994}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.

The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its [[Vs. Tour]] and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Tremor Christ]]\" and \"[[Nothingman]]\".<ref name=\"musician\">Garbarini, Vic. \"Mother of Pearl\".

Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said, \"''Vitalogy'' was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Bassist [[Jeff Ament]] said that \"communication was at an all-time low\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] stated that the communication problems started once guitarist [[Stone Gossard]] stopped acting as the band's mediator.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> According to Gossard, ''Vitalogy'' was the first album in which lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] made the final decisions.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band.<ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. December 22, 1996.</ref> Gossard said that the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of [[jam session]]s. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\"<ref name=\"musician\"/> During the production of ''Vitalogy'', lead guitarist [[Mike McCready]] went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/><ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\nDrums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\".<ref>Reynolds, John, et al. [http://www.twofeetthick.com/2005/05/who-is-the-drummer-on-satans-bed/ \"Who is the drummer on \"Satan's Bed\"?\"]. TwoFeetThick.com. May 12, 2005.</ref> Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for ''Vitalogy'', Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Gossard said, \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> [[Jack Irons]], the original drummer for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said, \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making ''Vitalogy''. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Better_Man.ogg\n |title        = \"Better Man\"\n |description  = A sample of \"Better Man\", from ''Vitalogy''. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and rejected it from the band's previous album ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility. The lyrics for the song, written by Vedder, are about an abusive relationship.\n |filename2    = Immortality.ogg\n |title2       = \"Immortality\"\n |description2 = A sample of \"Immortality\", the third single released from the album. The lyrics for the song have been claimed by some to be about Kurt Cobain; however, Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train\".\n}}\nIn a 1995 interview, ''[[Guitar World]]'' writer Jeff Gilbert described ''Vitalogy'' as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying, \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/> During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, \"''Vitalogy'' is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more [[Punk rock|punk]] feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, \"''Vitalogy'' is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.\"<ref name=\"guitar world\"/>\n\n[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|title=''Vitalogy'' \u2013 Pearl Jam|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vitalogy-mw0000121446|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}</ref> He added that \"in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music\u2014the mantrafunk of 'Aye Davanita', the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of 'Bugs', and the chilling sonic collage 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me'.\" \"Bugs\" features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop,<ref name=\"Marks\">Marks, Craig. \"Let's Get Lost\".

Vedder said, \"I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express.\"<ref name=\"Marks\"/> The lyrics of \"Not for You\" express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and \"how youth is being sold and exploited\",<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> while Vedder said \"Corduroy\" is about \"one person's relationship with a million people.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> In \"Pry, To\" the phrase \"P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me\" is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of \"Immortality\" may be about [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of \"Immortality\" were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding \"[[Nothingman]]\" that \"if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> \"[[Better Man (Pearl Jam song)|Better Man]]\" is a song about an abusive relationship.<ref>Cohen, Jonathan.

The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The band continued its boycott against [[Ticketmaster]] during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. {{ISBN|0-306-81271-1}}, pg. 64</ref> The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.\n\nThe tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1997.</ref> Ament later said, \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour.

Nicholls British Amb to Israel - Pres Ben Zvi 1954.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Nicholls (diplomat)|John Nicholls]], British ambassador to Israel, presenting his credentials to [[Yitzhak Ben Zvi]], 1954]]\nBritain seized Palestine from the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of [[World War I]]. Close cooperation between Britain and the [[Yishuv]], the nascent pre-state Jewish community of Palestine, developed during this time when Britain received intelligence from the [[Nili]] Jewish spy network, which assisted British forces in conquering Palestine. Additionally, over 5000 Jews from various countries served in the [[Jewish Legion]] of the British Army which fought at Gallipoli and in the Palestine Campaign, although some Palestinian Jews also served in the Ottoman Army. In 1917, Britain issued the pro-Zionist [[Balfour Declaration]], which called for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. Six weeks afterward, British troops concluded the Palestine campaign, driving out the Ottoman army from Jerusalem, under the leadership of General Allenby. The British then took control of Palestine. Under British military rule, the Zionist enterprise was renewed. In 1920, Britain established its authority under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate for Palestine]] granted by  the [[League of Nations]], which was confirmed in the San Remo agreement of 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adespicabletruce.org.uk/page75.html |title=The San Remo agreement 1920 |publisher=Adespicabletruce.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}</ref> A High Commissioner was appointed with instructions to allow the Jews to build their national home.<ref>Gilbert, M., 2008, The Story of Israel (Carter)</ref> and spent 31 years in charge of British Mandate Palestine under a League of Nations mandate that originally extended to both sides of the Jordan River, although [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] was separated from Palestine by the British.\n\nIn 1937, the [[Peel Commission]] presented a plan for a Jewish state and an Arab state. After this was rejected, the British District Commissioner for the Galilee, Lewis Yellard Andrews was assassinated by Arab gunmen in Nazareth. In 1939, Britain announced the [[White Paper of 1939]], which greatly restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases and called for a single unitary state in Palestine,  which greatly engaged the Yishuv. \n\nTowards the end of [[World War II]], the British faced a [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|growing Jewish insurgency]] in Palestine.<ref>Charters, David A. The British army and Jewish insurgency in Palestine, 1945-47. Springer, 1989, p. X</ref> The army's failure to defeat the insurgents convinced the British government that Palestine was a lost cause, and directly led to its decision to withdraw from the territory.<ref name=\"insideterrorism\">Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism.'' Columbia University Press, New York, pp. 49-51 </ref> In February 1947, the British government \u2013 having already decided to withdraw from India \u2013 announced it was handing the mandate back to the League of Nations. The British  mandate was relinquished and the establishment of the State of Israel was affirmed by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. The conflict with the insurgents continued until the last British soldier left Palestine; at the end of April 1948, British forces fought [[Operation Hametz|a small battle]] against Zionist militias near [[Jaffa]], temporarily preventing a Jewish takeover of the city, while failing to expel the militias from [[Menashiya]].\n\nThroughout the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], Anglo-Israeli relations were decidedly hostile, to the point of bringing the two countries to the edge of war. Britain, which had military forces in Egypt and Transjordan and defense agreements with both nations, foresaw possible military intervention on their behalf. Early in the war, a Royal Air Force base in Amman was hit during an Israeli raid on the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historynet.com/spitfire-vs-spitfire-aerial-combat-israels-war-independence.htm|title=Spitfire vs. Spitfire: Aerial Combat in Israel\u2019s War of Independence|last=O\u2019Connor|first=Derek|date=2017-03-07|website=HistoryNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> The British threatened to attack the Israeli Air Force if such an action was repeated. During the [[Battles of the Sinai (1948)|battles in Sinai]], the [[Royal Air Force]] conducted almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai. RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside [[Egyptian Air Force|Royal Egyptian Air Force]] planes, and high-flying British aircraft frequently flew over [[Haifa]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The British government planned military action against Israel codenamed Operation Clatter in the event of an Israeli invasion of Egypt and the flights were deployed to discover the strength of the Israeli Air Force and locate its forward bases. On 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance [[de Havilland Mosquito]] was shot down by an [[Israeli Air Force]] [[P-51 Mustang]]. On 7 January 1949, four British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] FR18s flew over an Israeli convoy that had been attacked by five Egyptian Spitfires fifteen minutes earlier. Fearing an imminent attack, Israeli ground troops opened fire on the British Spitfires, and shot down one with a tank-mounted machine gun. The remaining three Spitfires were subsequently shot down by Israeli planes, and two pilots were killed. Two of the surviving pilots were taken to [[Tel Aviv]] and interrogated, and were later released. The Israelis dragged the wrecks of the British planes into Israeli territory, but failed to conceal them before they were photographed by British reconnaissance planes. In response, the Royal Air Force readied its planes to bomb Israeli airfields, British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. Convinced the British would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots go without retaliation, the Israelis were determined to repel any retaliatory airstrike, and made preparations to defend their airbases. However, British commanders defied pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, and refused to authorize any strikes. Follpwing a British ultimatum to vacate the Sinai,  Israeli forces pulled back. War between Israel and the United Kingdom was thus avoided.<ref name=Spyflight>\"[http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm Iaf V Raf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414141639/http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm |date=2018-04-14 }}\".

Nicholls British Amb to Israel - Pres Ben Zvi 1954.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Nicholls (diplomat)|John Nicholls]], British ambassador to Israel, presenting his credentials to [[Yitzhak Ben Zvi]], 1954]]\nBritain seized Palestine from the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of [[World War I]]. Close cooperation between Britain and the [[Yishuv]], the nascent pre-state Jewish community of Palestine, developed during this time when Britain received intelligence from the [[Nili]] Jewish spy network, which assisted British forces in conquering Palestine. Additionally, over 5000 Jews from various countries served in the [[Jewish Legion]] of the British Army which fought at Gallipoli and in the Palestine Campaign, although some Palestinian Jews also served in the Ottoman Army. In 1917, Britain issued the pro-Zionist [[Balfour Declaration]], which called for the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. Six weeks afterward, British troops concluded the Palestine campaign, driving out the Ottoman army from Jerusalem, under the leadership of General Allenby. The British then took control of Palestine. Under British military rule, the Zionist enterprise was renewed. In 1920, Britain established its authority under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate for Palestine]] granted by  the [[League of Nations]], which was confirmed in the San Remo agreement of 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adespicabletruce.org.uk/page75.html |title=The San Remo agreement 1920 |publisher=Adespicabletruce.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}</ref> A High Commissioner was appointed with instructions to allow the Jews to build their national home.<ref>Gilbert, M., 2008, The Story of Israel (Carter)</ref> and spent 31 years in charge of British Mandate Palestine under a League of Nations mandate that originally extended to both sides of the Jordan River, although [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] was separated from Palestine by the British.\n\nIn 1937, the [[Peel Commission]] presented a plan for a Jewish state and an Arab state. After this was rejected, the British District Commissioner for the Galilee, Lewis Yellard Andrews was assassinated by Arab gunmen in Nazareth. In 1939, Britain announced the [[White Paper of 1939]], which greatly restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases and called for a single unitary state in Palestine,  which greatly engaged the Yishuv. \n\nTowards the end of [[World War II]], the British faced a [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|growing Jewish insurgency]] in Palestine.<ref>Charters, David A. The British army and Jewish insurgency in Palestine, 1945-47. Springer, 1989, p. X</ref> The army's failure to defeat the insurgents convinced the British government that Palestine was a lost cause, and directly led to its decision to withdraw from the territory.<ref name=\"insideterrorism\">Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism.'' Columbia University Press, New York, pp. 49-51 </ref> In February 1947, the British government \u2013 having already decided to withdraw from India \u2013 announced it was handing the mandate back to the League of Nations. The British  mandate was relinquished and the establishment of the State of Israel was affirmed by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. The conflict with the insurgents continued until the last British soldier left Palestine; at the end of April 1948, British forces fought [[Operation Hametz|a small battle]] against Zionist militias near [[Jaffa]], temporarily preventing a Jewish takeover of the city, while failing to expel the militias from [[Menashiya]].\n\nThroughout the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], Anglo-Israeli relations were decidedly hostile, to the point of bringing the two countries to the edge of war. Britain, which had military forces in Egypt and Transjordan and defense agreements with both nations, foresaw possible military intervention on their behalf. Early in the war, a Royal Air Force base in Amman was hit during an Israeli raid on the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historynet.com/spitfire-vs-spitfire-aerial-combat-israels-war-independence.htm|title=Spitfire vs. Spitfire: Aerial Combat in Israel\u2019s War of Independence|last=O\u2019Connor|first=Derek|date=2017-03-07|website=HistoryNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-25}}</ref> The British threatened to attack the Israeli Air Force if such an action was repeated. During the [[Battles of the Sinai (1948)|battles in Sinai]], the [[Royal Air Force]] conducted almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai. RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside [[Egyptian Air Force|Royal Egyptian Air Force]] planes, and high-flying British aircraft frequently flew over [[Haifa]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The British government planned military action against Israel codenamed Operation Clatter in the event of an Israeli invasion of Egypt and the flights were deployed to discover the strength of the Israeli Air Force and locate its forward bases. On 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance [[de Havilland Mosquito]] was shot down by an [[Israeli Air Force]] [[P-51 Mustang]]. On 7 January 1949, four British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] FR18s flew over an Israeli convoy that had been attacked by five Egyptian Spitfires fifteen minutes earlier. Fearing an imminent attack, Israeli ground troops opened fire on the British Spitfires, and shot down one with a tank-mounted machine gun. The remaining three Spitfires were subsequently shot down by Israeli planes, and two pilots were killed. Two of the surviving pilots were taken to [[Tel Aviv]] and interrogated, and were later released. The Israelis dragged the wrecks of the British planes into Israeli territory, but failed to conceal them before they were photographed by British reconnaissance planes. In response, the Royal Air Force readied its planes to bomb Israeli airfields, British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. Convinced the British would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots go without retaliation, the Israelis were determined to repel any retaliatory airstrike, and made preparations to defend their airbases. However, British commanders defied pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, and refused to authorize any strikes. Follpwing a British ultimatum to vacate the Sinai,  Israeli forces pulled back. War between Israel and the United Kingdom was thus avoided.<ref name=Spyflight>\"[http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm Iaf V Raf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414141639/http://www.spyflight.co.uk/iafvraf.htm |date=2018-04-14 }}\".

Tech Hub was inaugurated by [[George Osborne]], who served as Britain's [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

(2005)</ref> is the name of both a harbour and village in [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  Glandore is located about an hour's drive west of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] city.\n\nThe village has several [[pub]]s, with traditional music. It is a very popular holiday destination for Irish holiday makers in particular. Famous homeowners include [[Margaret Jay]], former leader of the [[House of Lords]], and at one time prominent business-man [[Tony O'Reilly]]. The Church of Ireland which has been restored is located at the entrance of [https://web.archive.org/web/20121109095733/http://rectory.ie/ The Rectory] originally a private home and then home of the Rectory and for a time a popular wedding venue. The Rectory (originally called East View) along with Bearna Donn (originally called West View) & Stone Hall were built in the 19th Century by the Allen Family. The village yacht club's official headquarters is located near the pier on the Old School Road.\n\nThe Irish Coast Guard has a unit based in Glandore at the \"Rocket House\" at the western end of the village.\n\nThe annual regatta takes place the third weekend of August. Sailing is the main attraction to the village; however, rowing and swimming are also a part of the community. \nIn former years there used also be Irish dancing competitions in the village square. The Lar Casey Cup is awarded to the winning Dragon class yacht.\n\nEvery 2 years (on odd years) the Glandore Classic Boat Regatta is held during the second week of July.[http://www.glandoreyc.com]\n\n==Geography==\nThe village is located on the east side of Glandore Harbour. The harbour is approximately three miles long north to south with the village of [[Leap, County Cork|Leap]] at the north end, [[Union Hall, County Cork|Union Hall]] on the west side and two small islands, named Adam and Eve, at the mouth of the harbour at the south end. The sailing directions in the harbour are \"to avoid Adam and hug Eve\".\nRocks in the middle of the harbour called The Perches have a flashing green mark to the western extremity indicating a safe channel. The Danger Rock further up the harbour is indicated with a flashing northern cardinal mark.\nThe harbour itself is located midway in Glandore bay which is the area between The Galley Head and Toe Head.\n\n[[Townlands]] in Glandore are Rushanes, Aughatubber, Drombeg in which [[Drombeg stone circle]] is located, Kilfinnan, Kilfaughnabeg, Brulea, Maulmarine, Kilcosan, Reenogreena, Cregg, Tralong, Carriglusky and Knockardan.\n\n[[File:glandore Harbour.JPG|thumb|Glandore Harbour]]\n\n==History==\n{{See also|\u00cdmar Ua Donnub\u00e1in}}\nDue to its location, Glandore was one of the earlier settlements in the area. In 1215, the [[Normans]] built two castles here. The present pier and wall were built in the first half of the 19th century.  A fair was held at ''Tr\u00e1 an Aonaigh'' (Beach of the Fair) also known as Tralong (Beach of the ship)  in the 18th century.\n\nGlandore was then for centuries closely associated with the [[O'Donovan]] family, who gained control of the harbour from the Normans and occupied its castles.\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nThe harbour supports a wide array of species. Seabirds include grey herons, oystercatchers, gannets, shags, cormorants, herring gulls and black tipped gulls. A number of seals live in the harbour. Whale, dolphin, porpoise and shark are frequently found in the greater bay area between the Galley Head and Toe Head. There are many seals in the area also. Mackerel can be plentiful in the harbour depending on the time of year.\n\n==Sailing==\n[[Image:Navigation marks in Glandore.jpg|thumb|alt=Navigation marks in Glandore.|Navigation marks in Glandore.]]\n[[Image:Danger Buoy Glandore.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Danger Buoy Glandore.|Danger Buoy Glandore.]]\nOver the years sailing has become a very widespread activity for both adults and children. The yacht club organizes 16+ courses every year for junior sailors while there is still courses for adults as well as powerboat and instructors courses. Every odd year Glandore hosts its \"Classic Boat Regatta\"  which takes place over the space of a week. Boats from all over the country come to participate in this event. \nThe [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[Squib sailboat|Squib]] keelboat classes and many [[Dinghy sailing|dinghy]] classes including [[Topaz]] are raced by club members. The club has turned out many talented sailors over the years such as champion of everything carbon-fibre, Colman O'Riordan. For many years Glandore has been home to veteran transatlantic yachtsman and sailing author Don Street who continues to participate in local Dragon racing.\n\n==Places of interest==\n*[[Drombeg stone circle]] (also known as ''The Druid's Altar''), is a [[Recumbent stone circles|recumbent stone circle]] located {{convert|2.4|km|0|abbr=on}} (1.5 miles) east of Glandore.<ref>{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland.

There is no entry fee for this site.\n\n==Churches==\n*There is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church one mile away on the [[Rosscarbery]] side of the village in the townland of Kilfaughnabeg (meaning \"Little church of Faughna\"). This church was built circa 1929. The building of a church at another location was abandoned before commencement of the construction of the existing church. The abandoned structure was in Killacoosane. Its erection had been undertaken by Fr. John Power, but  the project was abandoned after his death.<ref>''Parish Histories and Placenames of West Cork'', Bruno O'Donoghue.</ref> \n*Christ Church ([[Church of Ireland]]) is on the [[Leap, County Cork|Leap]] side of the village.

(2005)</ref> is the name of both a harbour and village in [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  Glandore is located about an hour's drive west of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] city.\n\nThe village has several [[pub]]s, with traditional music. It is a very popular holiday destination for Irish holiday makers in particular. Famous homeowners include [[Margaret Jay]], former leader of the [[House of Lords]], and at one time prominent business-man [[Tony O'Reilly]]. The Church of Ireland which has been restored is located at the entrance of [https://web.archive.org/web/20121109095733/http://rectory.ie/ The Rectory] originally a private home and then home of the Rectory and for a time a popular wedding venue. The Rectory (originally called East View) along with Bearna Donn (originally called West View) & Stone Hall were built in the 19th Century by the Allen Family. The village yacht club's official headquarters is located near the pier on the Old School Road.\n\nThe Irish Coast Guard has a unit based in Glandore at the \"Rocket House\" at the western end of the village.\n\nThe annual regatta takes place the third weekend of August. Sailing is the main attraction to the village; however, rowing and swimming are also a part of the community. \nIn former years there used also be Irish dancing competitions in the village square. The Lar Casey Cup is awarded to the winning Dragon class yacht.\n\nEvery 2 years (on odd years) the Glandore Classic Boat Regatta is held during the second week of July.[http://www.glandoreyc.com]\n\n==Geography==\nThe village is located on the east side of Glandore Harbour. The harbour is approximately three miles long north to south with the village of [[Leap, County Cork|Leap]] at the north end, [[Union Hall, County Cork|Union Hall]] on the west side and two small islands, named Adam and Eve, at the mouth of the harbour at the south end. The sailing directions in the harbour are \"to avoid Adam and hug Eve\".\nRocks in the middle of the harbour called The Perches have a flashing green mark to the western extremity indicating a safe channel. The Danger Rock further up the harbour is indicated with a flashing northern cardinal mark.\nThe harbour itself is located midway in Glandore bay which is the area between The Galley Head and Toe Head.\n\n[[Townlands]] in Glandore are Rushanes, Aughatubber, Drombeg in which [[Drombeg stone circle]] is located, Kilfinnan, Kilfaughnabeg, Brulea, Maulmarine, Kilcosan, Reenogreena, Cregg, Tralong, Carriglusky and Knockardan.\n\n[[File:glandore Harbour.JPG|thumb|Glandore Harbour]]\n\n==History==\n{{See also|\u00cdmar Ua Donnub\u00e1in}}\nDue to its location, Glandore was one of the earlier settlements in the area. In 1215, the [[Normans]] built two castles here. The present pier and wall were built in the first half of the 19th century.  A fair was held at ''Tr\u00e1 an Aonaigh'' (Beach of the Fair) also known as Tralong (Beach of the ship)  in the 18th century.\n\nGlandore was then for centuries closely associated with the [[O'Donovan]] family, who gained control of the harbour from the Normans and occupied its castles.\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nThe harbour supports a wide array of species. Seabirds include grey herons, oystercatchers, gannets, shags, cormorants, herring gulls and black tipped gulls. A number of seals live in the harbour. Whale, dolphin, porpoise and shark are frequently found in the greater bay area between the Galley Head and Toe Head. There are many seals in the area also. Mackerel can be plentiful in the harbour depending on the time of year.\n\n==Sailing==\n[[Image:Navigation marks in Glandore.jpg|thumb|alt=Navigation marks in Glandore.|Navigation marks in Glandore.]]\n[[Image:Danger Buoy Glandore.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Danger Buoy Glandore.|Danger Buoy Glandore.]]\nOver the years sailing has become a very widespread activity for both adults and children. The yacht club organizes 16+ courses every year for junior sailors while there is still courses for adults as well as powerboat and instructors courses. Every odd year Glandore hosts its \"Classic Boat Regatta\"  which takes place over the space of a week. Boats from all over the country come to participate in this event. \nThe [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[Squib sailboat|Squib]] keelboat classes and many [[Dinghy sailing|dinghy]] classes including [[Topaz]] are raced by club members. The club has turned out many talented sailors over the years such as champion of everything carbon-fibre, Colman O'Riordan. For many years Glandore has been home to veteran transatlantic yachtsman and sailing author Don Street who continues to participate in local Dragon racing.\n\n==Places of interest==\n*[[Drombeg stone circle]] (also known as ''The Druid's Altar''), is a [[Recumbent stone circles|recumbent stone circle]] located {{convert|2.4|km|0|abbr=on}} (1.5 miles) east of Glandore.<ref>{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland.

Shown is the [[crown (headgear)|terraced crown]] of the [[Chrysler Building]] lit at dawn.]]\n\nA '''central business district''' ('''CBD''') is the commercial and business center of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"[[city center|city centre]]\" or \"[[downtown]]\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central ''business'' district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown, or even several CBDs at once. In [[London]], for example, the \"city centre\" is usually regarded as encompassing the historic [[City of London]] and the mediaeval [[City of Westminster]], whereas the [[City of London]] and the transformed [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area are regarded as its two CBDs. In [[New York City]], [[Midtown Manhattan]] is the largest central business district in the city and in the world; yet [[Lower Manhattan]], commonly called ''Downtown Manhattan'', represents the second largest, and second, distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown. In [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Loop]] is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. [[Mexico City]] also has a historic city centre, the colonial-era [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]], along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century [[Paseo de la Reforma]] \u2013 [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]], and the new [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong [[Historic preservation|preservation]] laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as [[Paris]] or [[Vienna]]. In cities in the [[New World]] that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as [[Road transport|road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] transport, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 21st century have developed [[Megacity|megacities]], particularly in [[Asia]], that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers.<ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RSRQGRD Reviving American downtowns]\". ''[[The Economist]]''. 1 March 2007.</ref> No two CBDs look alike in terms of their spatial shape, however certain geometric patterns in these areas are recurring throughout many cities due to the nature of centralised commercial and industrial activities.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hartman |first=George W. |year=1950 |title=The Central Business District--A Study in Urban Geography |journal=Economic Geography |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=237\u2013244 |doi=10.2307/141260 |jstor=141260}}</ref>\n\n== Australia ==\nIn Australia the acronym CBD is used very commonly to refer to major city \"centres\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.traveller.com.au/its-rooted-aussie-terms-that-foreigners-just-wont-get-38nlc |title=It's rooted: Aussie terms that foreigners just won't get |last=Richards |first=Tim |date=2014-05-21 |work=Traveller |access-date=2017-12-16 }}</ref> It is used in particular to refer to the skyscraper districts in state capital cities such as [[Melbourne central business district|Melbourne]], [[Brisbane central business district|Brisbane]], [[Perth]], [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]] and [[Sydney central business district|Sydney]]. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:Sydney City Business District.jpg|[[Sydney]] has Australia's largest CBD\nFile:Melbourne skyline - cropped and contrast.jpg|[[Melbourne]] CBD\nFile:Skylines of Brisbane CBD in June 2019 seen from Paddington, Queensland (cut).jpg|[[Brisbane]] CBD\nFile:Perth_(AU),_View_from_Kings_Park_--_2019_--_0435-42.jpg|[[Perth]] CBD\n</gallery>\n\n== Botswana ==\n\nThe [[iTowers of Masa Square CBD]] were built for doing business tasks only. It is located within [[Gaborone]].\n\n== Canada==\n[[File:Toronto Financial District August 2017.jpg|thumb|Skyscrapers in [[downtown Toronto]], Canada.]]\nIn Canada, central business districts are referred to as \"downtown\" or the \"downtown core\" and are mostly highlighted by skyscrapers. In [[Quebec]] and the rest of [[French Canada]], they are known as {{lang|fr|centre-ville}}. [[Toronto]] has [[Downtown Toronto]] (the largest in Canada), which includes the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] of Canada, major sporting and entertainment venues, educational institutions and multiple corporate headquarters. Additional central business districts in Toronto's divisions [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] serve their respective populations as local commercial areas. [[Midtown Toronto]] is another secondary central business district that rapidly developed during the 20th century from initially being a suburb. Toronto's surrounding suburban cities of [[Mississauga]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] contain developed or developing central business districts.\n\nOther major Canadian cities, including [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] also contain downtown districts with skyscrapers above 200 metres in height. Cities, such as [[Quebec City]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Ottawa]], mostly contain downtowns with cultural and heritage landmarks which restrict the heights of developments.\n\n== Mainland China ==\n[[File:Lujiazui 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Lujiazui]], [[Shanghai]].]]\n[[File:Guomao Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing CBD]], [[Beijing]].]]\n\nIn China terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are used but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52a1\u533a) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8d38\u6613\u533a) may exist. Large Chinese cities typically have multiple CBDs spread throughout the urban area. Cities traditionally being major cultural centres with many historic structures in the core such as [[Beijing]], [[Suzhou]] or [[Xi'an]] will have the [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built adjacent to the urban core, similar to European cities. While other cities such as [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Wuhan]] the city centre will typically house a number of CBDs in addition to [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built in the periphery.\n\n== France ==\nIn [[France]], the term \"quartier d\u2019affaires\" may be used to describe the central business district. The main business districts in the country are as follows:\n\n* [[La D\u00e9fense]] in [[Paris]], which with 3,300,000 square meters of office space is Europe's leading business district in terms of area.\n* [[La Part-Dieu]] in [[Lyon]], is the 2nd largest business district in France and has nearly 1,600,000 square metres.\n* [[Euralille]] in [[Lille]], is the 3rd business district of France with 1,120,000 square metres of offices.\n* [[Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] in [[Marseille]], is the 4th business district in France with 650,000 square metres of offices.\n\n== Germany ==\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Stadtansicht von der Deutschherrnbruecke zu Beginn der Abenddaemmerung.jpg|thumb|Central business district of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].]]\nIn [[Germany]], the terms ''Innenstadt'' and ''Stadtzentrum'' may be used to describe the central business district. Both terms can be literally translated to mean \"[[inner city]]\" and \"city centre\". Some of the [[metropolitan regions in Germany|larger cities]] have more than one central business district, like [[Berlin]], which has three.\n\nDue to Berlin's history of division during the [[Cold War]], the city contains central business districts both in West ([[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]]) and East Berlin ([[Alexanderplatz]]), as well as a newly built business centre near [[Potsdamer Platz]]. The city's historic centre \u2013 the location of the [[Reichstag building]], as well as the [[Brandenburg gate]] and most federal ministries \u2013 was largely abandoned when the [[Berlin Wall]] cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of [[Potsdamer Platz]], and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.\n\nIn [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], there is a business district which is in the geographical centre of the city and it is called the [[Bankenviertel]].\n\n<br />\n[[File:Frankfurt Central Business District.jpg|alt=Central Business District of Frankfurt am Main|border|center|thumb|316x316px|The Central Business District in the German City of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Central District Night View 201305.jpg|thumb|[[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] has been the political and financial centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]]]]\n\nIn [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], there is a business district which is located around the famous High-Street [[K\u00f6nigsallee]] with banks, shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/mischung-macht-das-zentrum-einzigartig-aid-1.4753856 |title=D\u00fcsseldorfs Central Business District: Mischung macht das Zentrum einzigartig |author=Thorsten Breitkopf |work=RP ONLINE |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong ==\n[[File:Kwun Tong Dusk View 201407.jpg|thumb|Kwun Tong-Kowloon Bay CBD of [[Kowloon East (constituency)|East Kowloon]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (15512862984).jpg|thumb|[[West Kowloon]] CBD]]\nIn [[Hong Kong]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Sheung Wan]], [[Wan Chai|Wanchai]] and [[Causeway Bay]] are considered as the central business districts of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]]. The [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] has generally been considered the city centre of [[Kowloon]] before another core emerged in [[Cheung Sha Wan]].\n\nAs part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], the [[Union Square (Hong Kong)|Union Square]] project launched by the MTR Corporation has brought it another CBD in [[West Kowloon]]. With the latest implementation of \"Energising Kowloon East\" Scheme by the Hong Kong Government, [[Kowloon Bay]] and [[Kwun Tong]] Business Area have been gradually redeveloped and transformed into CBDs.\n\nThe CBDs of new towns and satellite cities such as [[Tuen Mun]], [[Sha Tin]] and [[Tung Chung]] have been characterised by sky-scraping residential blocks on top of large shopping centres that provide services to local residents. These mixed use development usually surround the central public transit station of such towns.\n\n== Indonesia ==\nThe largest CBD in Indonesia is known as the [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Golden Triangle]] (''Segitiga Emas'' in [[Indonesian language]]) in [[Jakarta]]. The area is located along the main avenues of Jakarta, [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman]] \u2013 [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin]] -[[Jalan H.R. Rasuna Said]] \u2013 [[Jalan Prof. Dr. Satrio]] \u2013 [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto]]. [[SCBD|Sudirman Central Business District]], a super block that is located within the Golden Triangle, is the first of its kind in Indonesia, and one of the largest commercial center development in the city. Jakarta started developing the sophistication of its Business District in the early 1960s before to host the [[1962 Asian Games|Asian Games in 1962]].<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/06/22/sukarno-s-vision-a-modern-capital.html thejakartapost.com]; Sukarno's vision of a modern capital</ref>\n\n[[Surabaya]] in [[East Java]], built its first central business district in the Darmo region.

[[Karachi]] is Pakistan's largest city and the country's economic hub; the [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]] of the city, often called the \"Wall Street of Pakistan,\" acts as Karachi's main financial district and is essentially a center of economic and industrial activity. [[Shahrah-e-Faisal|Shahra-e-Faisal]] in Karachi is also one of the most important business districts of Pakistan.\n\nAnother important business district is [[Gulberg, Lahore]]. It has a large number of important office buildings as well as many high-rises and shopping malls. City Towers,<ref name=\"homes.mitula.pk\">{{cite web |url=http://homes.mitula.pk/lahore-high-rise-buildings |title=Lahore High Rise Buildings \u2013 Mitula Homes |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref> Pace Tower, M.M Alam road, Vogue Towers, Park Plaza Hotel, Tricon Tower,<ref name=\"homes.mitula.pk\" /> MM Tower,<ref name=\"homes.mitula.pk\" /> Boulevard Heights and Ali Trade Centre are present in this area. [[Ferozepur Road]] is also central business district of [[Lahore]]. It is served by [[Lahore bus rapid transit]].

The [[Paseo de la Castellana]] holds the city's main business districts: the [[Gate of Europe]], [[AZCA]] and [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]]. AZCA is 19-hectare super block near [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] stadium [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. It used to be the country's main business area during the 1980s and 1990s, when most of its skyscrapers were built. The tallest building of AZCA is the [[Torre Picasso]], a 158-tower designed by the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center's]] architect, and contains the main offices in Spain of [[Google]] and [[Deloitte]]. The Gate of Europe consists of two twin towers, which hold Spanish bank [[Bankia]] and real state company Realia. Just a few blocks north is the CTBA, a complex of four skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain. Architects such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Cesar Pelli]] have designed its towers, which were completed in 2008. The tallest building, the [[Torre de Cristal]], is the fourth tallest building is [[Western Europe]], with a height of 250 metres. The complex is home to offices from well known companies such as [[KPMG]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Bankia]], [[Cepsa]], [[Pwc]], [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] and holds the embassies of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], Canada and [[Australia]], as well as a 5-star hotel from [[Eurostars Hotels|Eurostars]].

In 2005, the [[Torre Agbar]], designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], became the third tallest building in the city with a height of 145 metres.

There are many central business districts located on the island of [[Taiwan]]. In [[Taipei]], the capital city of [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]), the area around its [[Taipei Station|main railway station]] or [[Zhongzheng District]] is regarded as the historic city centre whilst the [[Xinyi District]](especially [[Xinyi Special District]]) or [[Eastern District of Taipei]] located to the east of the said railway station is the current CBD of Taipei, being both the modern financial, political and economic district and the premier shopping area, including the location of [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan's tallest building, rising {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}}.\n\nIn the southern [[Taiwan]]ese city of [[Kaohsiung]], the main CBDs are [[Cianjin District]] and [[Lingya District]]; and in the central Taiwanese metropolitan area of [[Taichung]], the CBD is [[Xitun District]], especially [[Taichung's 7th Redevelopment Zone]], in which most high-rise buildings containing offices are concentrated.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 02.jpg|thumb|One of two CBDs in London, [[Canary Wharf]] is slightly to the east of London's centre.]]\n[[File:The city of london 2019.jpg|thumb|[[City of London|The City]] in central London.]]\nThe alternative term ''city centre'' is used in United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In British-influenced countries, such as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth realms]], former British territories, also use many of the same terms, but also have many characteristics of British cities. In the UK, Australia and South Africa, the term is often just shortened to \"city\", as in \"going to the city\"; it is often also called \"town\" (\"going (in)to town\", \"going up town\", or \"going down town\"). One exception is in [[London]] where \"the City\" specifically refers to the [[City of London]] (one of the two main financial districts), rather than to any other part of [[London]].\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline from Edgbaston Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham]] city centre's skyline, as seen from [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]].]]\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:Lower Manhattan viewed from Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City. [[One World Trade Center]] is the tallest [[skyscraper]] in the Western Hemisphere.]]\n\nIn the United States, central business districts are often called \"downtown\" (even if there is no \"uptown\"). In most cities the downtown area will be home to the financial district, but usually contains entertainment and retail of some kind as well. The downtown areas of many cities, such as [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Houston]], are also home to large sports and convention venues. Historic sections of a central business district may be called \"old town\", while decaying parts of the centre city are commonly called the \"[[inner city]]\". The term ''inner city'' is sometimes used evocatively, applying a negative connotation and referring to peripheral areas that suffered economically from [[white flight]].\n\nSome cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], have [[Mixed-use development|mixed use]] districts known as \"uptown\" in addition to the primary downtown core areas. In some cities, such as [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], \"uptown\" is instead the historic name for a separate business center or neighbourhood. [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] use the term ''Center City'' instead of ''downtown'' for their central business districts as well as most of the cities and towns in the northwest states. In other cities, like [[Los Angeles]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Omaha]], the city core is simply known as \"downtown\".  [[Jacksonville, Florida]] refers to its central business district as the [[Downtown Jacksonville|Urban Core]], a term which is also sometimes applied to its denser surrounding neighborhoods.  In [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the phrase [[Central Business District, New Orleans|central business district]] is used; and while ''downtown'' is sometimes used synonymously, traditionally it referred to parts of the city downriver from [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], which did not include the CBD.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Business improvement district]]\n* [[Downtown]]\n* [[List of central business districts]]\n* [[Peak land value intersection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cities}}\n\n[[Category:Central business districts| ]]\n[[Category:City]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Commercial and business centre of a city}}\n{{redirect|Central Business District|the historic city center in Miami|Central Business District (Miami)|other districts|List of central business districts}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n {{original research|date=September 2015}}\n {{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n {{Globalize|date=December 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Midtown Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], the largest central business district in the world. Shown is the [[crown (headgear)|terraced crown]] of the [[Chrysler Building]] lit at dawn.]]\n\nA '''central business district''' ('''CBD''') is the commercial and business center of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"[[city center|city centre]]\" or \"[[downtown]]\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central ''business'' district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown, or even several CBDs at once. In [[London]], for example, the \"city centre\" is usually regarded as encompassing the historic [[City of London]] and the mediaeval [[City of Westminster]], whereas the [[City of London]] and the transformed [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area are regarded as its two CBDs. In [[New York City]], [[Midtown Manhattan]] is the largest central business district in the city and in the world; yet [[Lower Manhattan]], commonly called ''Downtown Manhattan'', represents the second largest, and second, distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown. In [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Loop]] is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. [[Mexico City]] also has a historic city centre, the colonial-era [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]], along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century [[Paseo de la Reforma]] \u2013 [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]], and the new [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong [[Historic preservation|preservation]] laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as [[Paris]] or [[Vienna]]. In cities in the [[New World]] that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as [[Road transport|road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] transport, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 21st century have developed [[Megacity|megacities]], particularly in [[Asia]], that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers.<ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RSRQGRD Reviving American downtowns]\".

In [[Quebec]] and the rest of [[French Canada]], they are known as centre-ville. [[Toronto]] has [[Downtown Toronto]] (the largest in Canada), which includes the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] of Canada, major sporting and entertainment venues, educational institutions and multiple corporate headquarters. Additional central business districts in Toronto's divisions [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] serve their respective populations as local commercial areas. [[Midtown Toronto]] is another secondary central business district that rapidly developed during the 20th century from initially being a suburb. Toronto's surrounding suburban cities of [[Mississauga]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] contain developed or developing central business districts.\n\nOther major Canadian cities, including [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] also contain downtown districts with skyscrapers above 200 metres in height. Cities, such as [[Quebec City]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Ottawa]], mostly contain downtowns with cultural and heritage landmarks which restrict the heights of developments.\n\n== Mainland China ==\n[[File:Lujiazui 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Lujiazui]], [[Shanghai]].]]\n[[File:Guomao Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing CBD]], [[Beijing]].]]\n\nIn China terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are used but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52a1\u533a) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8d38\u6613\u533a) may exist. Large Chinese cities typically have multiple CBDs spread throughout the urban area. Cities traditionally being major cultural centres with many historic structures in the core such as [[Beijing]], [[Suzhou]] or [[Xi'an]] will have the [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built adjacent to the urban core, similar to European cities. While other cities such as [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Wuhan]] the city centre will typically house a number of CBDs in addition to [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built in the periphery.\n\n== France ==\nIn [[France]], the term \"quartier d\u2019affaires\" may be used to describe the central business district. The main business districts in the country are as follows:\n\n* [[La D\u00e9fense]] in [[Paris]], which with 3,300,000 square meters of office space is Europe's leading business district in terms of area.\n* [[La Part-Dieu]] in [[Lyon]], is the 2nd largest business district in France and has nearly 1,600,000 square metres.\n* [[Euralille]] in [[Lille]], is the 3rd business district of France with 1,120,000 square metres of offices.\n* [[Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] in [[Marseille]], is the 4th business district in France with 650,000 square metres of offices.\n\n== Germany ==\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Stadtansicht von der Deutschherrnbruecke zu Beginn der Abenddaemmerung.jpg|thumb|Central business district of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].]]\nIn [[Germany]], the terms ''Innenstadt'' and ''Stadtzentrum'' may be used to describe the central business district. Both terms can be literally translated to mean \"[[inner city]]\" and \"city centre\". Some of the [[metropolitan regions in Germany|larger cities]] have more than one central business district, like [[Berlin]], which has three.\n\nDue to Berlin's history of division during the [[Cold War]], the city contains central business districts both in West ([[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]]) and East Berlin ([[Alexanderplatz]]), as well as a newly built business centre near [[Potsdamer Platz]]. The city's historic centre \u2013 the location of the [[Reichstag building]], as well as the [[Brandenburg gate]] and most federal ministries \u2013 was largely abandoned when the [[Berlin Wall]] cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of [[Potsdamer Platz]], and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.\n\nIn [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], there is a business district which is in the geographical centre of the city and it is called the [[Bankenviertel]].\n\n<br />\n[[File:Frankfurt Central Business District.jpg|alt=Central Business District of Frankfurt am Main|border|center|thumb|316x316px|The Central Business District in the German City of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Central District Night View 201305.jpg|thumb|[[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] has been the political and financial centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]]]]\n\nIn [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], there is a business district which is located around the famous High-Street [[K\u00f6nigsallee]] with banks, shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/mischung-macht-das-zentrum-einzigartig-aid-1.4753856 |title=D\u00fcsseldorfs Central Business District: Mischung macht das Zentrum einzigartig |author=Thorsten Breitkopf |work=RP ONLINE |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong ==\n[[File:Kwun Tong Dusk View 201407.jpg|thumb|Kwun Tong-Kowloon Bay CBD of [[Kowloon East (constituency)|East Kowloon]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (15512862984).jpg|thumb|[[West Kowloon]] CBD]]\nIn [[Hong Kong]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Sheung Wan]], [[Wan Chai|Wanchai]] and [[Causeway Bay]] are considered as the central business districts of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]].

Chundrigar Road]] of the city, often called the \"Wall Street of Pakistan,\" acts as Karachi's main financial district and is essentially a center of economic and industrial activity. [[Shahrah-e-Faisal|Shahra-e-Faisal]] in Karachi is also one of the most important business districts of Pakistan.\n\nAnother important business district is [[Gulberg, Lahore]]. It has a large number of important office buildings as well as many high-rises and shopping malls.

The [[Paseo de la Castellana]] holds the city's main business districts: the [[Gate of Europe]], [[AZCA]] and [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]]. AZCA is 19-hectare super block near [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] stadium [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. It used to be the country's main business area during the 1980s and 1990s, when most of its skyscrapers were built. The tallest building of AZCA is the [[Torre Picasso]], a 158-tower designed by the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center's]] architect, and contains the main offices in Spain of [[Google]] and [[Deloitte]]. The Gate of Europe consists of two twin towers, which hold Spanish bank [[Bankia]] and real state company Realia. Just a few blocks north is the CTBA, a complex of four skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain. Architects such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Cesar Pelli]] have designed its towers, which were completed in 2008. The tallest building, the [[Torre de Cristal]], is the fourth tallest building is [[Western Europe]], with a height of 250 metres. The complex is home to offices from well known companies such as [[KPMG]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Bankia]], [[Cepsa]], [[Pwc]], [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] and holds the embassies of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], Canada and [[Australia]], as well as a 5-star hotel from [[Eurostars Hotels|Eurostars]].

Despite the fact that the Catalan capital does not have a reputation for skyscrapers and financial hubs, in the recent years it has attracted several media and technology companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Yahoo!]]. In 2005, the [[Torre Agbar]], designed by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], became the third tallest building in the city with a height of 145 metres. The building soon became a symbol of Barcelona and was going to become a [[Hyatt]] hotel.

Bilbao has completely transformed its city centre in the last 20 years, and now holds several main offices of banks like [[BBVA]] and [[Kutxabank]] as well as the [[Iberdrola Tower]], a 165-metre skyscraper which belongs to Spanish electric company [[Iberdrola]].\n\n== Taiwan ==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Taipei, Taiwan CBD Skyline.jpg|[[Taipei]]'s CBD \u2013 [[Xinyi District]]'s skyline, with [[Taipei 101]] in the background.\nFile:Kaohsiung Skyline 2020.jpg|[[Kaohsiung]] \u2013 second largest city in [[Taiwan]], containing many CBDs.\nFile:\u7531\u81fa\u4e2d\u6e2f\u8def\u3001\u5b89\u548c\u8def\u53e3\u5929\u6a4b \u5f80\u6771\u770b\u65b0\u5e02\u653f\u5c08\u7528\u5340\u30102015\u5e741\u6708\u3011.JPG|[[Taichung]] cityscape in Taiwan.\n</gallery>\n\nIn Taiwan, terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are often used, but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52d9\u5340) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8cbf\u6613\u5340) or \"Yolk area\" (\u86cb\u9ec3\u5340) are also frequently used. There are many central business districts located on the island of [[Taiwan]]. In [[Taipei]], the capital city of [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]), the area around its [[Taipei Station|main railway station]] or [[Zhongzheng District]] is regarded as the historic city centre whilst the [[Xinyi District]](especially [[Xinyi Special District]]) or [[Eastern District of Taipei]] located to the east of the said railway station is the current CBD of Taipei, being both the modern financial, political and economic district and the premier shopping area, including the location of [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan's tallest building, rising {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}}.\n\nIn the southern [[Taiwan]]ese city of [[Kaohsiung]], the main CBDs are [[Cianjin District]] and [[Lingya District]]; and in the central Taiwanese metropolitan area of [[Taichung]], the CBD is [[Xitun District]], especially [[Taichung's 7th Redevelopment Zone]], in which most high-rise buildings containing offices are concentrated.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 02.jpg|thumb|One of two CBDs in London, [[Canary Wharf]] is slightly to the east of London's centre.]]\n[[File:The city of london 2019.jpg|thumb|[[City of London|The City]] in central London.]]\nThe alternative term ''city centre'' is used in United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In British-influenced countries, such as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth realms]], former British territories, also use many of the same terms, but also have many characteristics of British cities. In the UK, Australia and South Africa, the term is often just shortened to \"city\", as in \"going to the city\"; it is often also called \"town\" (\"going (in)to town\", \"going up town\", or \"going down town\"). One exception is in [[London]] where \"the City\" specifically refers to the [[City of London]] (one of the two main financial districts), rather than to any other part of [[London]].\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline from Edgbaston Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham]] city centre's skyline, as seen from [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]].]]\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:Lower Manhattan viewed from Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City.

In most cities the downtown area will be home to the financial district, but usually contains entertainment and retail of some kind as well. The downtown areas of many cities, such as [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Houston]], are also home to large sports and convention venues. Historic sections of a central business district may be called \"old town\", while decaying parts of the centre city are commonly called the \"[[inner city]]\". The term ''inner city'' is sometimes used evocatively, applying a negative connotation and referring to peripheral areas that suffered economically from [[white flight]].\n\nSome cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], have [[Mixed-use development|mixed use]] districts known as \"uptown\" in addition to the primary downtown core areas. In some cities, such as [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], \"uptown\" is instead the historic name for a separate business center or neighbourhood. [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] use the term ''Center City'' instead of ''downtown'' for their central business districts as well as most of the cities and towns in the northwest states. In other cities, like [[Los Angeles]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Omaha]], the city core is simply known as \"downtown\".  [[Jacksonville, Florida]] refers to its central business district as the [[Downtown Jacksonville|Urban Core]], a term which is also sometimes applied to its denser surrounding neighborhoods.  In [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the phrase [[Central Business District, New Orleans|central business district]] is used; and while ''downtown'' is sometimes used synonymously, traditionally it referred to parts of the city downriver from [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], which did not include the CBD.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Business improvement district]]\n* [[Downtown]]\n* [[List of central business districts]]\n* [[Peak land value intersection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cities}}\n\n[[Category:Central business districts| ]]\n[[Category:City]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCanada:Formatting, phrasing and punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district"}

It is not clear when or why he adopted it, since some accounts of his dietary habits prior to the [[Second World War]] indicate that he consumed meat as late as 1937. By 1938, Hitler's public image as a vegetarian was already being fostered, and from 1942, he self-identified as a vegetarian. Personal accounts from people who knew Hitler and were familiar with his diet indicate that he did not consume meat as part of his diet during this period, with several contemporaneous witnesses\u2014such as [[Albert Speer]] (in his memoirs, ''Inside the Third Reich'')\u2014noting that Hitler used vivid and gruesome descriptions of animal suffering and slaughter at the dinner table to try to dissuade his colleagues from eating meat. A supposed examination of Hitler's remains carried out by French scientists in 2017 found no traces of meat fibre in the [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] on Hitler's teeth. Though in truth, Hitler's remains have never been found let alone identified and examined.\n\nSome modern-day analyses have speculated that Hitler's vegetarianism may have been for [[vegetarianism#Health effects|health]] reasons due to [[Richard Wagner]]'s historical theories, or even a psychological reaction to his niece's death rather than a commitment to [[animal welfare]]. In contrast, several eyewitness sources  maintain Hitler was a vegetarian because of his concern for animal suffering, noting that he was often distressed by images of animal cruelty and suffering, and was an [[antivivisection]]ist.\n\n==Contemporary records==\n{{Rquote|right|Do you know that your F\u00fchrer is a vegetarian, and that he does not eat meat because of his general attitude toward life and his love for the world of animals?

He had a particular enthusiasm for birds and most of all for wolves. [...] Goebbels said, famously, 'The only real friend one has in the end is the dog. . . The more I get to know the human species, the more I care for my Benno.' Goebbels also agreed with Hitler that 'meat eating is a perversion in our human nature,' and that Christianity was a 'symptom of decay', since it did not urge vegetarianism. [...] On the one hand, monsters of cruelty towards their fellow humans; on the other, kind to animals and zealous in their interest. In their very fine essay on such contradictions, Arnold Arluke and [[Boria Sax]] offer three observations. One, as just noted, many Nazi leaders harboured affection towards animals but antipathy to humans. Hitler was given films by a [[maharaja]] which displayed animals killing people.

It is not clear when or why he adopted it, since some accounts of his dietary habits prior to the [[Second World War]] indicate that he consumed meat as late as 1937. By 1938, Hitler's public image as a vegetarian was already being fostered, and from 1942, he self-identified as a vegetarian. Personal accounts from people who knew Hitler and were familiar with his diet indicate that he did not consume meat as part of his diet during this period, with several contemporaneous witnesses\u2014such as [[Albert Speer]] (in his memoirs, ''Inside the Third Reich'')\u2014noting that Hitler used vivid and gruesome descriptions of animal suffering and slaughter at the dinner table to try to dissuade his colleagues from eating meat. An examination of Hitler's remains carried out by French scientists in 2017 found no traces of meat fibre in the [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] on Hitler's teeth.\n\nSome modern-day analyses have speculated that Hitler's vegetarianism may have been for [[vegetarianism#Health effects|health]] reasons due to [[Richard Wagner]]'s historical theories, or even a psychological reaction to his niece's death rather than a commitment to [[animal welfare]]. In contrast, several eyewitness sources  maintain Hitler was a vegetarian because of his concern for animal suffering, noting that he was often distressed by images of animal cruelty and suffering, and was an [[antivivisection]]ist.\n\n==Contemporary records==\n{{Rquote|right|Do you know that your F\u00fchrer is a vegetarian, and that he does not eat meat because of his general attitude toward life and his love for the world of animals?

If ever a scene showed (even fictional) cruelty to or death of an animal, Hitler would cover his eyes and look away until someone alerted him the scene was over. [[Alexander Cockburn]] also wrote of Hitler:\n{{quote|Nazi leaders were noted for love of their pets and for certain animals, notably [[apex predators]] like the [[wolf]] and the [[lion]]. Hitler, a vegetarian and hater of hunting, adored dogs and spent some of his final hours in the company of [[Blondi]], whom he would take for walks outside the bunker at some danger to himself. He had a particular enthusiasm for birds and most of all for wolves. [...] Goebbels said, famously, 'The only real friend one has in the end is the dog. . . The more I get to know the human species, the more I care for my Benno.' Goebbels also agreed with Hitler that 'meat eating is a perversion in our human nature,' and that Christianity was a 'symptom of decay', since it did not urge vegetarianism. [...] On the one hand, monsters of cruelty towards their fellow humans; on the other, kind to animals and zealous in their interest. In their very fine essay on such contradictions, Arnold Arluke and [[Boria Sax]] offer three observations. One, as just noted, many Nazi leaders harboured affection towards animals but antipathy to humans. Hitler was given films by a [[maharaja]] which displayed animals killing people. The F\u00fchrer watched with equanimity. Another film showed humans killing animals.

After the death of Valdivia in [[Tucapel]] (1553), he aided the population in the south with food and in 1554 he crushed a rebellion of the [[Promaucaes]] in [[Gualemo]] on the [[Lontu\u00e9 River]], which now is the province of [[Curic\u00f3]].<ref>[[Jer\u00f3nimo de Vivar]], [http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/11498.htm '''Cr\u00f3nica y relaci\u00f3n copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526101641/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/cronicas/contextos/11498.htm |date=2008-05-26 }} ARTEHISTORIA REVISTA DIGITAL; Cr\u00f3nicas de Am\u00e9rica {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nJufr\u00e9 later fought against [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]] and was in the campaigns of [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]]. He participated in the refounding of [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] in 1559.  When [[Francisco de Villagra]] became governor of Chile, Jufr\u00e9 was named Lieutenant Governor of the [[Province of Cuyo]] in 1561 and founded the city of [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan de la Frontera]] and refounded [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Returning in 1562 because of the new Mapuche revolt, he became lieutenant of [[Governor of Chile]] and organized aid for the war in the south.  He continued participating in the war for more than a decade. \n\nIn the [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] of Santiago (the municipal city council) Jufr\u00e9 held various positions, such as [[alcalde]] (magistrate) and [[regidor]] in the decades between 1550 and 1570.  In addition, in 1556 he was royal [[alferiz]] of the city, between 1562 and 1563 he was its [[corregidor]] and he represented it in 1568 before the [[Real Audiencia]] established in Concepcion.\n\n==Accomplishments==\nJufr\u00e9 made a fortune developing important economic activities in Chile. He built the first shipyard next to the [[Maule River]], in his [[encomienda]] of Pocoa. He planted the first vineyards in his encomienda of Macul near Santiago where he made wine that he sold in Peru along with other goods. Trade was conducted on his own ships.  In 1553, he established a mill on the [[Mapocho River]] and later a textile factory amid his two encomiendas (Mataquito and [[Peteroa]]) on the banks of the [[Mataquito River]].  He died in Santiago in 1578 and was buried at the Church of Santo Domingo. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Toribio Medina]]: [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0008968.pdf  '''Diccionario Biogr\u00e1fico Colonial''', Imprenta Elzeviriana, Santiago, 1906].\n*Jos\u00e9 Toribio Medina: '''Colecci\u00f3n de documentos in\u00e9ditos para la historia de Chile''', Tomo XV, VALDIVIA.

The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; they were on a scale not surpassed until the [[September 11 attacks]] three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators - yielding information wanted by investigators- and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court.

At some time in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he married an [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and had children.<ref name=\"BBC\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3938133.stm Key al-Qaeda suspect arrested], ''[[BBC]]'', July 30, 2004.</ref>\n\n==Wanted and arrest for terrorist activities==\nOn May 26, 2004, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] announced that reports indicated that Ghailani was one of seven al-Qaeda members who were planning a terrorist action for the summer or fall of 2004.

The poetry of [[T. S.

He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.
