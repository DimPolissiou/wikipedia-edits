Regulus had his forces execute a night march to launch two separate dawn assaults on the Carthaginians' fortified hilltop camp. One part of this force was repulsed and pursued down the hill. The other part then charged the pursuing Carthaginians in the rear and routed them in turn. At this the Carthaginians remaining in the camp panicked and fled.\n\nThe Romans advanced to and captured [[Tunis]], only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Despairing, the Carthaginians sued for peace. However, the terms offered by Regulus were so harsh  Carthage resolved to fight on. A few months later at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]] Regulus was decisively beaten and his army all but wiped out. The war continued for a further 14 years.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.38|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Punicus'' (or ''Poenicus''), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 c. 118 BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of Adys.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius' work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|left|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the Western Mediterranean; Rome had [[Roman expansion in Italy|recently unified mainland Italy]] south of the [[Arno]] under its control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 256 BC the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}}\n\nThe Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=130}} The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their allies.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}} In 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet using a shipwrecked Carthaginian [[quinquereme]] as a blueprint for their own ships.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}}\n\nNaval victories at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] and [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]], and their frustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily, led the Romans to focus on a sea-based strategy and to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten their capital, Carthage (close to what is now [[Tunis]]).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=155}} Both sides were determined to establish [[naval supremacy]] and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=83}}\n\nThe Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transports sailed from [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, commanded by the consuls for the year, [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] and [[Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus]].{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=434}} They embarked approximately 26,000 picked legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}}{{sfn|Walbank|1959|p=10}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=84\u201385}} The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] and [[Hamilcar (Drepanum)|Hamilcar]], off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. With a combined total of about 680 warships carrying up to 290,000 crew and marines, the battle was possibly the largest naval battle in history by the number of combatants involved.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=436}} When they met in the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]], the Carthaginians took the initiative, anticipating that their superior ship handling skills would tell.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=459}} After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians were defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=69}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nAs a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Regulus, landed in Africa near Aspis (modern [[Kelibia]]) on the [[Cape Bon|Cape Bon Peninsula]] in the summer of 256 BC and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=176}} They captured 20,000 slaves, \"vast herds of cattle\", and [[Siege of Aspis|the city of Aspis]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=70}} The [[Roman Senate]] sent orders for most of the Roman ships and a large part of the army to return to Sicily, probably due to the logistical difficulties of feeding these more than 100,000 men over the winter.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=207}} Regulus was left with 40 ships, 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to overwinter in Africa.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=186}}{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=377}} His orders were to weaken the Carthaginian army pending reinforcement in the spring. It was expected he would achieve this by raids and by fomenting rebellion among Carthage's subject territories, but consuls had wide discretion.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=207}} Regulus chose to take his relatively small force and strike inland.{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} He advanced on the city of [[Uthina|Adys]], only {{convert|60|km|sigfig=1}} south-east of Carthage, and besieged it.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} The Carthaginians, meanwhile, had recalled Hamilcar from Sicily with 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Hamilcar and two otherwise unknown generals named Hasdrubal and Bostar were placed in joint command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans'.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=186\u2013187}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}}\n\n==Armies==\n{{main|Roman army of the mid-Republic|Military of Carthage}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaires|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nMost male Roman citizens were eligible for military service, and would serve as infantry with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}} It is not clear how the 15,000 infantry at Adys were constituted, but they possibly represented four slightly under-strength legions: two Roman and two allied.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=98}} Regulus did not attract any troops from the towns and cities rebelling against Carthage. In this he differed from other generals, including Roman ones, leading armies against Carthage in Africa. The reasons for this are not known, and his failure to make up his deficiency in cavalry in particular is puzzling.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=102}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. When they did they fought as well armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=31}} In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} Most of the Carthaginian infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]] were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands, although it is not clear if any were present at Adys.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}} The precise makeup of the army at Adys is not known, but a few months later{{#tag:ref|At the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]].|group=note}} the Carthaginians fielded 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry; the latter would have included the 5,000 veterans from Sicily and many citizen-militia.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=208}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nDetermined to prevent the Romans despoiling the countryside, the Carthaginians advanced to Adys, where they set up a fortified camp on a rocky hill near the town.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}} Apparently they did not wish to commit to a battle on the open ground around Adys too hastily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}} Polybius is critical of this decision by the Carthaginians, as their main advantages over the Romans were their cavalry and their elephants, neither of which could be deployed to advantage from behind fortifications, on steep ground, or in rough terrain. Modern historians point out that the Carthaginian generals would have been well aware of the strength of the legions when formed up in open battle and that to pause in a strong position while scouting the enemy and formulating a plan was not obviously a mistake,{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=100}} especially as their army was newly formed and not yet fully trained or used to operating together.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=36, 85\u201386}} Although Tipps describes this deployment as a \"total misuse\" of their cavalry and elephants.{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}}\n[[File:Pompeii, Statuette of a war elephant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=A small, white statuette of an elephant with a mahout|{{center|Roman statuette of a [[war elephant]] recovered from [[Pompeii]]}}]]\n\nWith the Carthaginian army overlooking him from a fortified hill Regulus immediately made the audacious decision to split his army in two and have each carry out a night march with the intention of launching a surprise dawn attack on the camp. The Romans would be attacking uphill against the Carthaginians' prepared position, but an attack from two directions would be difficult to respond to.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}} Tipps describes the plan as a demonstration of Regulus's \"recklessness\".{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} Both Roman forces were in position on time and successfully launched their attacks, although apparently not simultaneously.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} Complete surprise cannot have been achieved, as at least a large part of the Carthaginians were able to form up and confront one wing of the Roman assault. This wing was thrown back by the Carthaginians{{snd}}it is assumed at the line of their fortifications, although this is not certain{{snd}}and driven down the hill in disorder.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} The situation was apparently confused, with the rest of the Carthaginians taking no effective action and failing to co-ordinate with their victorious colleagues.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} According to the military historian Nigel Bagnall, the cavalry and elephants were promptly evacuated, as it was recognised they would not be able to play any useful role, either in defending the fortifications or on the broken terrain of the hill more generally.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}}\n\nThe Carthaginians pursuing chased the Roman force off the hill,{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} and all or part of the second Roman force, rather than attacking the Carthaginian camp, charged downhill into the rear of the now over-extended Carthaginians.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} It is possible this group of Carthaginians also faced a frontal attack by Roman reserves after leaving the hill.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=100}} In any event, after some further fighting they fled the field. At this the Carthaginians in the camp, the fortifications of which had not been breached, panicked and withdrew.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} The Romans pursued for some distance, although Polybius provides no figures for Carthaginian losses.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=101}} Modern historians suggest the Carthaginians suffered few or no losses to their cavalry and elephants.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=100}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} Breaking off their pursuit, the victorious Romans plundered the hilltop camp.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Romans followed up and captured numerous towns, including Tunis, only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=101}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} From Tunis the Romans raided and devastated the immediate area around Carthage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} Many of Carthage's African possessions took the opportunity to rise in revolt. The city of Carthage was packed with refugees fleeing Regulus or the rebels and food ran out. In despair, the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=73}} Regulus, within sight of what he took to be a thoroughly defeated Carthage, demanded harsh terms: Carthage was to hand over Sicily, [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]; pay all of Rome's war expenses; pay tribute to Rome each year; be prohibited from declaring war or making peace without Roman permission; have its navy limited to a single warship; but provide 50 large warships to the Romans on their request. Finding these completely unacceptable, the Carthaginians decided to fight on.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=187}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}}\n\nThey gave charge of the training of their army to the [[Sparta]]n, mercenary commander [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]].{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} In 255 BC Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 elephants against the Romans and decisively defeated them at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]]. Approximately 2,000 Romans retreated to Aspis; 500, including Regulus, were captured; the rest were killed.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=88\u201390}} Xanthippus, fearful of the envy of the Carthaginian generals he had outdone, took his pay and returned to Greece.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=91}}\n\nThe Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians attempted to oppose it. In the resulting Battle of Cape Hermaeum off Africa the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=438}} The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, with 384 ships sunk from their total of 464{{#tag:ref|This assumes, per G.K .

Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}} The question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and

Regulus had his forces execute a night march to launch two separate dawn assaults on the Carthaginians' fortified hilltop camp. One part of this force was repulsed and pursued down the hill. The other part then charged the pursuing Carthaginians in the rear and routed them in turn. At this the Carthaginians remaining in the camp panicked and fled.\n\nThe Romans advanced to and captured [[Tunis]], only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Despairing, the Carthaginians sued for peace. However, the terms offered by Regulus were so harsh  Carthage resolved to fight on. A few months later at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]] Regulus was decisively beaten and his army all but wiped out. The war continued for a further 14 years.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.38|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Punicus'' (or ''Poenicus''), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 c. 118 BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of Adys.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius' work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|left|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the Western Mediterranean; Rome had [[Roman expansion in Italy|recently unified mainland Italy]] south of the [[Arno]] under its control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 256 BC the war had grown into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}}\n\nThe Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=130}} The Romans were essentially a land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily. The war there had reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=97}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their allies.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}} In 260 BC Romans set out to construct a fleet using a shipwrecked Carthaginian [[quinquereme]] as a blueprint for their own ships.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}}\n\nNaval victories at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] and [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]], and their frustration at the continuing stalemate in Sicily, led the Romans to focus on a sea-based strategy and to develop a plan to invade the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa and threaten their capital, Carthage (close to what is now [[Tunis]]).{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=155}} Both sides were determined to establish [[naval supremacy]] and invested large amounts of money and manpower in maintaining and increasing the size of their navies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=83}}\n\nThe Roman fleet of 330 warships plus an unknown number of transports sailed from [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port of Rome, in early 256 BC, commanded by the consuls for the year, [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] and [[Lucius Manlius Vulso Longus]].{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=434}} They embarked approximately 26,000 picked legionaries from the Roman forces on Sicily.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}}{{sfn|Walbank|1959|p=10}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=84\u201385}} The Carthaginians were aware of the Romans' intentions and mustered all available warships, 350, under [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] and [[Hamilcar (Drepanum)|Hamilcar]], off the south coast of Sicily to intercept them. With a combined total of about 680 warships carrying up to 290,000 crew and marines, the battle was possibly the largest naval battle in history by the number of combatants involved.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=436}} When they met in the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]], the Carthaginians took the initiative, anticipating that their superior ship handling skills would tell.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=459}} After a prolonged and confused day of fighting the Carthaginians were defeated, losing 30 ships sunk and 64 captured to Roman losses of 24 ships sunk.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=69}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nAs a result of the battle, the Roman army, commanded by Regulus, landed in Africa near Aspis (modern [[Kelibia]]) on the [[Cape Bon|Cape Bon Peninsula]] in the summer of 256 BC and began ravaging the Carthaginian countryside.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=176}} They captured 20,000 slaves, \"vast herds of cattle\", and [[Siege of Aspis|the city of Aspis]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=70}} The [[Roman Senate]] sent orders for most of the Roman ships and a large part of the army to return to Sicily, probably due to the logistical difficulties of feeding these more than 100,000 men over the winter.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=207}} Regulus was left with 40 ships, 15,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to overwinter in Africa.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=186}}{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=377}} His orders were to weaken the Carthaginian army pending reinforcement in the spring. It was expected he would achieve this by raids and by fomenting rebellion among Carthage's subject territories, but consuls had wide discretion.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=207}} Regulus chose to take his relatively small force and strike inland.{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} He advanced on the city of [[Uthina|Adys]], only {{convert|60|km|sigfig=1}} south-east of Carthage, and besieged it.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} The Carthaginians, meanwhile, had recalled Hamilcar from Sicily with 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Hamilcar and two otherwise unknown generals named Hasdrubal and Bostar were placed in joint command of an army which was strong in cavalry and elephants and was approximately the same size as the Romans'.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=186\u2013187}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}}\n\n==Armies==\n{{main|Roman army of the mid-Republic|Military of Carthage}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaires|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nMost male Roman citizens were eligible for military service, and would serve as infantry with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}} It is not clear how the 15,000 infantry at Adys were constituted, but they possibly represented four slightly under-strength legions: two Roman and two allied.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=98}} Regulus did not attract any troops from the towns and cities rebelling against Carthage. In this he differed from other generals, including Roman ones, leading armies against Carthage in Africa. The reasons for this are not known, and his failure to make up his deficiency in cavalry in particular is puzzling.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=102}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. When they did they fought as well armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=31}} In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} Most of the Carthaginian infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]].{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} [[Sling (weapon)|Slingers]] were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands, although it is not clear if any were present at Adys.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}} The precise makeup of the army at Adys is not known, but a few months later{{#tag:ref|At the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]].|group=note}} the Carthaginians fielded 100 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and 12,000 infantry; the latter would have included the 5,000 veterans from Sicily and many citizen-militia.{{sfn|Andrei|Nedu|2010|p=208}}\n\n==Battle==\n\nDetermined to prevent the Romans despoiling the countryside, the Carthaginians advanced to Adys, where they set up a fortified camp on a rocky hill near the town.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}} Apparently they did not wish to commit to a battle on the open ground around Adys too hastily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=85}} Polybius is critical of this decision by the Carthaginians, as their main advantages over the Romans were their cavalry and their elephants, neither of which could be deployed to advantage from behind fortifications, on steep ground, or in rough terrain. Modern historians point out that the Carthaginian generals would have been well aware of the strength of the legions when formed up in open battle and that to pause in a strong position while scouting the enemy and formulating a plan was not obviously a mistake,{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=100}} especially as their army was newly formed and not yet fully trained or used to operating together.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=36, 85\u201386}} Although Tipps describes this deployment as a \"total misuse\" of their cavalry and elephants.{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}}\n[[File:Pompeii, Statuette of a war elephant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=A small, white statuette of an elephant with a mahout|{{center|Roman statuette of a [[war elephant]] recovered from [[Pompeii]]}}]]\n\nWith the Carthaginian army overlooking him from a fortified hill Regulus immediately made the audacious decision to split his army in two and have each carry out a night march with the intention of launching a surprise dawn attack on the camp. The Romans would be attacking uphill against the Carthaginians' prepared position, but an attack from two directions would be difficult to respond to.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}} Tipps describes the plan as a demonstration of Regulus's \"recklessness\".{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} Both Roman forces were in position on time and successfully launched their attacks, although apparently not simultaneously.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} Complete surprise cannot have been achieved, as at least a large part of the Carthaginians were able to form up and confront one wing of the Roman assault. This wing was thrown back by the Carthaginians{{snd}}it is assumed at the line of their fortifications, although this is not certain{{snd}}and driven down the hill in disorder.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} The situation was apparently confused, with the rest of the Carthaginians taking no effective action and failing to co-ordinate with their victorious colleagues.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} According to the military historian Nigel Bagnall, the cavalry and elephants were promptly evacuated, as it was recognised they would not be able to play any useful role, either in defending the fortifications or on the broken terrain of the hill more generally.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}}\n\nThe Carthaginians pursuing chased the Roman force off the hill,{{sfn|Tipps|2003|p=378}} and all or part of the second Roman force, rather than attacking the Carthaginian camp, charged downhill into the rear of the now over-extended Carthaginians.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} It is possible this group of Carthaginians were also facing Roman reserves to their front now they had left the hill.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=100}} In any event, after some further fighting they fled the field. At this the Carthaginians in the camp, the fortifications of which had not been breached, panicked and withdrew.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} The Romans pursued for some distance, although Polybius provides no figures for Carthaginian losses.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=101}} Modern historians suggest the Carthaginians suffered few or no losses to their cavalry and elephants.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=100}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=86}} Breaking off their pursuit, the victorious Romans plundered the hilltop camp.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=72}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Romans followed up and captured numerous towns, including Tunis, only {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=101}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} From Tunis the Romans raided and devastated the immediate area around Carthage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}} Many of Carthage's African possessions took the opportunity to rise in revolt. The city of Carthage was packed with refugees fleeing Regulus or the rebels and food ran out. In despair, the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=73}} Regulus, within sight of what he took to be a thoroughly defeated Carthage, demanded harsh terms: Carthage was to hand over Sicily, [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]; pay all of Rome's war expenses; pay tribute to Rome each year; be prohibited from declaring war or making peace without Roman permission; have its navy limited to a single warship; but provide 50 large warships to the Romans on their request. Finding these completely unacceptable, the Carthaginians decided to fight on.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=187}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=87}}\n\nThey gave charge of the training of their army to the [[Sparta]]n, mercenary commander [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]].{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=157}} In 255 BC Xanthippus led an army of 12,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 100 elephants against the Romans and decisively defeated them at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|Battle of Tunis]]. Approximately 2,000 Romans retreated to Aspis; 500, including Regulus, were captured; the rest were killed.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=188}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=88\u201390}} Xanthippus, fearful of the envy of the Carthaginian generals he had outdone, took his pay and returned to Greece.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=91}}\n\nThe Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians attempted to oppose it. In the resulting Battle of Cape Hermaeum off Africa the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=438}} The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, with 384 ships sunk from their total of 464{{#tag:ref|This assumes, per G.K .

majority non-Roman Latin allies.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}} The war continued for a further 14 years, mostly on Sicily or the nearby waters, before ending with a Roman victory; the terms offered to Carthage were more generous than those proposed by Regulus.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}} The question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and

The [[county town]] is [[Banff, Scotland|Banff]], although the largest community is [[Buckie]] to the west. It borders the [[Moray Firth]] to the north, [[County of Moray|Morayshire ]] and [[Inverness-shire]] to the west, and [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the east and south.\n\n==Local government council==\nBetween 1890 and 1975 the County of Banff, also known as Banffshire, had its own [[county council]]. In 1975 Banffshire was abolished for the purpose of local government and its territory divided between the local government districts of [[Moray]] and [[Banff and Buchan]], which lay within the [[Grampian]] region. In 1996, the Grampian region was abolished, and the area now lies within the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council areas]] of [[Moray]] and [[Aberdeenshire]] (note that both these polities have different boundaries to the historic counties of the same names).\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:View to Ben Rinnes - geograph.org.uk - 1339405.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Rinnes]]\nBanffshire consists of a 30-mile segment of coast along the [[Moray Firth]] from [[Spey Bay]] to [[Cullaykhan Bay]], the immediate hinterland, plus a long, tapering 'tail' stretching inland some 55 or so miles, thus giving the county a rather odd, elongated shape. The coastal section is fairly flat, with a large numbers of bays and headlands (the most notable of these being - from west to east - [[Craig Head]], [[Long Head]], [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen Bay]], [[Logan Head]], [[Crathie Point]], [[Sandend Bay]], [[Links Bay]], [[Strathmarchin Bay]], [[Cowhythe Bay]], [[Boyne Bay]], [[Whyntie Head]], [[Knock Head]], [[Boyndie Bay]], [[Banff Bay]], [[Head of Garness]], [[More Head]], [[Gamrie Bay]], [[Troup Head]], [[Downie Bay]] and [[Cullykhan Bay]]. Some small islands lies of the coast, such as [[West Muck]], [[East Muck]], [[Craigenroan]] and the [[Collie Rocks]]. The interior is generally hilly, rising to the [[Cairngorms]] in the far south, where the highest peak in the county and second highest in Scotland ([[Ben Macdui|Ben Macdhui]]) can be found on the border with Aberdeenshire. The county's largest lochs are also located in the far south, such as [[Loch Avon]], [[Dubh Lochan]], [[Lochan a' Bhainne]], [[Lochan nan Gabhar]] and [[Loch Builg]]. The main rivers are the [[Deveron]], [[River Spey|Spey]], [[River Isla, Moray|Isla]], [[Aven (Banffshire)|Aven]], [[Fiddich]], [[Ailnach]] and [[Livet (river)|Livet]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cullen Castle, Banffshire.jpg|thumb|left|Cullen House, Banffshire]]\nConsiderable evidence of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] human habitation exists particularly near the [[coast]]al area. For example, the [[Longman Hill]] [[cairn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11228/longman_hill.html#fieldnotes |title=Longman Hill (Long Barrow) &#124; UK |publisher=The Modern Antiquarian.com |date=1924-12-24 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref> and [[Cairn Lee]] are situated in the northern portion of Banffshire in the vicinity of the [[Burn of Myrehouse]].<ref>United Kingdom Ordnance Survey Map 1:50,000 (2004)</ref>\n\nLocated in the area are the ruins of several medieval castles and the 12th century [[kirk]] of [[Gamrie]].\n\nThe region remained largely [[Roman Catholic]] after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (16th century) and suffered greatly in the ensuing struggles.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (17th century), Banffshire was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nUntil 1891 the county contained various [[exclave]]s which were locally situated in Aberdeenshire, the biggest being the parish and village of [[St. Fergus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10203880&c_id=10107260 |title=St Fergus through time &#124; Census tables with data for the Scottish Parish |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Civil parishes==\n[[File:BANFFSHIRE Civil Parish map.jpg|thumb|Banffshire civil parish map c. 1854]]\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1930, parishes formed part of the [[local government]] system of Scotland, having parochial boards from 1845 to 1894.\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n# [[Aberlour]]\n# Alvah\n# [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]]\n# Bellie (probably now all in Moray)\n# [[Boharm]]\n# Botriphnie [[Drummuir]]\n# [[Boyndie]]\n# [[Cabrach]]\n# [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]]\n# [[Deskford]]\n# [[Fordyce, Aberdeenshire|Fordyce]]\n# Forglen\n# [[Gamrie]]\n# Glass<ref>The Imperial gazetteer of Scotland (1854) of Scotland (1854) by Rev.

The [[county town]] is [[Banff, Scotland|Banff]], although the largest community is [[Buckie]] to the west. It borders the [[Moray Firth]] to the north, [[County of Moray|Morayshire ]] and [[Inverness-shire]] to the west, and [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the east and south.\n\n==Local government council==\nBetween 1890 and 1975 the County of Banff, also known as Banffshire, had its own [[county council]]. In 1975 Banffshire was abolished for the purpose of local government and its territory divided between the local government districts of [[Moray]] and [[Banff and Buchan]], which lay within the [[Grampian]] region. In 1996, the Grampian region was abolished, and the area now lies within the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council areas]] of [[Moray]] and [[Aberdeenshire]] (note that both these polities have different boundaries to the historic counties of the same names).\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:View to Ben Rinnes - geograph.org.uk - 1339405.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Rinnes]]\nBanffshire consists of a 30 mile segment of coast along the [[Moray Firth]] from [[Spey Bay]] to [[Cullaykhan Bay]], the immediate hinterland, plus a long, tapering 'tail' stretching inland some 55 or so miles, thus giving the county a rather odd, elongated shape. The coastal section is fairly flat, with a large numbers of bays and headlands (the most notable of these being - from west to east - [[Craig Head]], [[Long Head]], [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen Bay]], [[Logan Head]], [[Crathie Point]], [[Sandend Bay]], [[Links Bay]], [[Strathmarchin Bay]], [[Cowhythe Bay]], [[Boyne Bay]], [[Whyntie Head]], [[Knock Head]], [[Boyndie Bay]], [[Banff Bay]], [[Head of Garness]], [[More Head]], [[Gamrie Bay]], [[Troup Head]], [[Downie Bay]] and [[Cullykhan Bay]]. Some small islands lies of the coast, such as [[West Muck]], [[East Muck]], [[Craigenroan]] and the [[Collie Rocks]]. The interior is generally hilly, rising to the [[Cairngorms]] in the far south, where the highest peak in the county and second highest in Scotland ([[Ben Macdui|Ben Macdhui]]) can be found on the border with Aberdeenshire. The county's largest lochs are also located in the far south, such as [[Loch Avon]], [[Dubh Lochan]], [[Lochan a' Bhainne]], [[Lochan nan Gabhar]] and [[Loch Builg]]. The main rivers are the [[Deveron]], [[River Spey|Spey]], [[River Isla, Moray|Isla]], [[Aven (Banffshire)|Aven]], [[Fiddich]], [[Ailnach]] and [[Livet (river)|Livet]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cullen Castle, Banffshire.jpg|thumb|left|Cullen House, Banffshire]]\nConsiderable evidence of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] human habitation exists particularly near the [[coast]]al area. For example, the [[Longman Hill]] [[cairn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11228/longman_hill.html#fieldnotes |title=Longman Hill (Long Barrow) &#124; UK |publisher=The Modern Antiquarian.com |date=1924-12-24 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref> and [[Cairn Lee]] are situated in the northern portion of Banffshire in the vicinity of the [[Burn of Myrehouse]].<ref>United Kingdom Ordnance Survey Map 1:50,000 (2004)</ref>\n\nLocated in the area are the ruins of several medieval castles and the 12th century [[kirk]] of [[Gamrie]].\n\nThe region remained largely [[Roman Catholic]] after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (16th century) and suffered greatly in the ensuing struggles.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (17th century), Banffshire was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nUntil 1891 the county contained various [[exclave]]s which were locally situated in Aberdeenshire, the biggest being the parish and village of [[St. Fergus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10203880&c_id=10107260 |title=St Fergus through time &#124; Census tables with data for the Scottish Parish |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Civil parishes==\n[[File:BANFFSHIRE Civil Parish map.jpg|thumb|Banffshire civil parish map c. 1854]]\nCivil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1930, parishes formed part of the [[local government]] system of Scotland, having parochial boards from 1845 to 1894.\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n# [[Aberlour]]\n# Alvah\n# [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]]\n# Bellie (probably now all in Moray)\n# [[Boharm]]\n# Botriphnie [[Drummuir]]\n# [[Boyndie]]\n# [[Cabrach]]\n# [[Cullen, Moray|Cullen]]\n# [[Deskford]]\n# [[Fordyce, Aberdeenshire|Fordyce]]\n# Forglen\n# [[Gamrie]]\n# Glass<ref>The Imperial gazetteer of Scotland (1854) of Scotland (1854) by Rev.

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of [[COBOL]], an early [[high-level programming language]] still in use today.\n\nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Yale University]] and was a professor of mathematics at [[Vassar College]]. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]] but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. In 1949, she joined the [[Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation]] and was part of the team that developed the [[UNIVAC I]] computer.  At Eckert\u2013Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into [[machine code]] understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program [[Linker (computing)|linker]] (originally called a compiler), which was written for the [[A-0 System]].<ref name=\"Spencer85\">{{cite book|title=Computers and Information Processing|publisher=C.E.

In 1959, she participated in the [[CODASYL]] consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the [[COBOL]] language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.  She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], sharing her computing experiences.\n\nThe U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|0}} guided-missile destroyer {{USS|Hopper}} was named for her, as was the [[Cray XE6]] \"Hopper\" supercomputer at [[NERSC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/retired-systems/hopper/|title=Hopper|website=www.nersc.gov|access-date=2016-03-19}}</ref> During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world.

Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]] but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by [[Howard H. Aiken]].

She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks.

Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, [[Muteesa I of Buganda|Kabaka Muteesa I Mukaabya Walugembe Kayiira]], the 30th Kabaka of the [[Kingdom of Buganda]], who reigned from 1856 until 1884, maintained a palace on the hill. It was at this palace that British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] met Kabaka Walugembe Muteesa I in 1862. Muteesa detained Speke for some months before finally releasing him in his quest to look for the source of the [[River Nile|Nile River]].

Jason's storylines have mostly revolved around his relationships with various women including, [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]), [[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]), [[Violet Wilson]] ([[Jenny Platt]]), [[Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) and [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]).

He leaves Weatherfield after being manipulated to by his mother's new boyfriend, [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre).\n\n==Storylines==\nJason is the son of [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] ([[Alan Igbon]]/Terence Maynard). Jason does not know his father for many years, but they reunite in 2003. Upon his arrival, he is an aspiring runner - something which Eileen does not completely approve of. He works for a brief period in [[Sally Webster]]'s ([[Sally Dynevor]]) electrical shop in 2001 until the failing business catches fire and is permanently closed down. He finds  a traumatised [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) lying in the ginnel, following her rape in April 2001, while out jogging early one morning.\n\nAlthough Jason has had many romances, all of them were short-lived since he has phobia to commitment. He has had many flings with street residents, [[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) and [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]). He seemed to have settled down with [[Violet Wilson]] ([[Jenny Platt]]), even uncharacteristically promising to care for her when he thought she was pregnant. Jason is stunned to learn about Violet sharing a drunken kiss with his friend/employer, [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). He attempts to continue the relationship but is unable to forgive Violet and ends their relationship. During their separation, he starts dating Sarah and despite reconciling with Violet, he continues his affair with her. Eventually, Violet discovers the affair and dumps Jason. Separated from Violet again, Jason and Sarah continue their relationship, much to the dismay of their mothers. Their relationship struggles initially as Sarah feels insecure about his feelings for Violet and the fact he proposed to Sarah while still with Violet, leading to a showdown in which Sarah ends her relationship with Jason in the Rovers. After days of constant quarrels, Jason ultimately decides to get back with Sarah and after she refuses to speak to him, Jason breaks into her house and proposes. She accepts, although they suffer further disapproval from their mothers. They announce their engagement in the Rovers in Violet's presence, which Sarah wants to do to make a point. The wedding, though, is a disaster. Jason decides he cannot commit and flees through a toilet window at the venue, leaving Sarah heartbroken. After months of ignoring Jason, Sarah reunites with him. However, on [[Christmas Day]] 2006, Jason has a major surprise delivered to the front door in the shape of a baby - his little girl by a young woman called Emma ([[Stephanie Waring]]). It later turns out that baby Holly is the baby of [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]].\n\nOut of revenge for his family disowning him, David loosens the bolts on the scaffolding at the builder's yard on 22 October 2007, a week before Jason and Sarah's wedding. Later, David decides that it was a bad idea, however he gets to the builder's yard to see Jason leaning on the balcony. When Bill jumps on him as a joke, the two of them fall onto the street below, Bill on top of Jason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/soaps/corry/corry-42541.html|title=Coronation Street-Jason Falls From The Scaffolding|publisher=}}</ref> In the hospital, Jason is told that he might not walk again for some time. He is on crutches at his and Sarah's wedding.\n\nSarah asks Jason to take her wedding dress to the cleaners but he accidentally leaves it in ''Roy's Rolls'' where David picks it up and puts it in a puddle before putting it in a bin bag with other bits and pieces that the Morton kids get from their neighbours. The Mortons' Guy Fawkes gets first prize and, as the dress burns, Sarah recognizes it as her wedding dress before Jason admits that he lost it. Sarah knows immediately that this is David's doing. Jason, Sarah and her daughter [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]] (Amy & Emily Walton) are set to leave for Milan on 30 December 2007, after Sarah gets a job from her uncle Stephen (Todd Boyce). Jason backs out when Sarah admits that she planted drugs in David's drawer at the salon, thereby ruining his chances of Stephen offering him the job in Milan.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2007, Jason and [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) kiss as the midnight bells chimes, and on 1 February 2008, they have sex. Jason regrets it afterwards and visits Sarah in Milan to tell her he had cheated on her with Becky. Instead of forgiving him, she attacks him, giving him a black eye. When he returns to the Street, Becky hits him too.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/events/is-liam-yet-another-love-rat/|title=Is Liam yet another love rat|work=[[What's on TV?]]|date=25 January 2008|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, Jason and Becky have sex again and they become a couple. However, they argue when Jason wants a night in alone. In October 2008, Jason discovers that Sarah is considering coming home. He immediately phones her and she agrees to give him another chance. Meanwhile, he is preparing to move in with Becky but dumps her and flies to Italy. Becky later attacks him in the Rovers for his betrayal.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kilkelly, Daniel|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a129214/corrie-prepares-for-dramatic-fight-scene.html |title=Corrie prepares for dramatic fight scene - Coronation Street News - Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> Everything backfires for Jason when he subsequently discovers that Sarah has decided to reconcile with her Italian boyfriend, just as he is going to Milan to meet her. On 16 February 2009, Jason and Becky sleep together and reunite after revealing that he and Sarah are divorcing. To prove to Becky that he is serious this time, he proposes and she accepts. Unfortunately, [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) also proposes to Becky and although she initially decides to marry Jason, she realises she can not go through with it and calls off the engagement.\n\nIn June 2009, Jason sleeps with David's ex-girlfriend [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). They start dating, however when Tina tells David the truth about her and Jason, he turns nasty and starts throwing bricks at Jason. Jason fights back and the pair have to be separated by the locals. Tina and Jason buy No. 12a Coronation Street and move in together in July 2009. Jason and Tina redecorate the flat and hold a house-warming party in September 2009 but in November, a loan shark named [[Rick Neelan]] fakes interest in buying the flat, when he is actually waiting for Tina's father, [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe]] ([[Reece Dinsdale]]), about the debt he owes him. Before Christmas 2009, Tina and Jason row after it is discovered that Jason is still married to Sarah. In retaliation, she shares a kiss with [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), his brother-in-law. They reconcile however, and in January 2010, when Joe and Gail go on their honeymoon, he asks Jason to look out for Tina, who is in danger from the loan sharks. On 12 February, Jason gives Tina a [[Valentine's Day]] present of his divorce papers to Sarah. Tina thinks that is her full Valentine's Day present and goes to get alcohol to celebrate. When she returns, Jason proposes to her after she has seen the ring and she accepts. However, following Joe's sudden death, Tina struggles with her grief and ends her engagement to Jason and he moves out of the flat, though he reclaims it.\n\nOn 2 April 2010, Jason gets drunk in the Rovers after Tina calls off their engagement. He later returns to the builder's yard where he is told to go home. However, when he turns to leave, Jason falls down the stairs <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/coronation-street/episodes/jason-falls-down-the-stairs|title=Jason falls down the stairs! - Episode - Coronation Street - What's on TV|publisher=}}</ref> and is rendered unconscious. He is taken to the [[hospital]] where he appears to be fine, apart from losing the memory of him and Tina breaking up. Eileen, worried about what he'll do, visits Tina's house where she informs her of Jason's [[amnesia]], but Tina doesn't believe her. Jason's memory soon returns.\n\nUpon finding out Tina is now dating [[Graeme Proctor]], he is angry that Tina slept with Graeme while she was with him and locks her out of the flat. Then he teams up with David (who was Graeme's best friend) to humiliate Tina and Graeme further; first by David using Graeme's clothes to mop up water (Graeme had handcuffed David to the Platts' radiator, and David then pulled it off the wall.) David then cut the hoods off Graeme's hoodies and the peaks off his caps and Jason throws binbags of Tina's clothes on top of her from the house's windows, all in front of a crowd. Satisfied, David and Jason end their partnership but remain close friends.\n\nOn 24 September 2010, Jason is recruited by a half-naked [[Rosie Webster]] to drive her in [[Kevin Webster|Kevin]]'s car to Sheffield to pick up [[Sophie Webster|Sophie]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) and her girlfriend [[Sian Powers|Sian]] ([[Sacha Parkinson]]) after they ran away together. Immediately, there is chemistry between the pair; on 18 October, Rosie books [[Owen Armstrong|Owen]] to come round and redecorate the kitchen after the oven catches fire whilst Sally and Kevin are away. On the 21st, whilst Jason is busy with the Websters' kitchen, and Rosie is looking for a cab to take her to an important modelling job, she mentions that it is 'underwear modelling', so Jason offers to be her driver. With Jason not knowing what a 'green screen' is and the male model going AWOL, Rosie volunteers Jason to step in, and the pair complete the photoshoot together; with Jason looking very pleased with himself when they get home, they sleep together. The next day, Jason thinks he has done something wrong as Rosie is evasive and not paying him for the work he did on the kitchen; she eventually pays him and he buys her a 'fake' version of the handbag that she wanted and the pair sleep together again and agree to start dating.\n\nWhen the Joinery bar exploded, bringing a tram off the viaduct which smashes into the Corner Shop and ''The Kabin'', Jason helps to rescue people who are trapped, including going into No.13 (which is in flames) to find [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]). He finds him in a closet upstairs and they both escape, assisted by the fire brigade.  Upon escaping, he is thanked gratefully by the Barlow family and praised by the residents for his courage. With Jason and Rosie living together, they start the new year looking out for Sophie and Sian as they get kicked out of the Websters. When Graeme convinces Claire to run away after she admits to the police that she attacked [[Tracy Barlow]], Jason helps her and her sons escape and drives her to the airport, on 14 January. On 17 January, Eileen's money troubles get a lot worse, and number 11 starts crumbling around her; she seeks help from an insurance firm but when Jason spots a man lurking at the back of the house, he thinks he is trying to spy on Rosie and punches him, only to discover that he is the insurance inspector, which of course, affects the result and Eileen can not claim a penny.\n\nOn 4 February, after Rosie agrees to go to a \"mother and baby\" photo shoot, which \"pays a fortune\", they convince Kevin to let them have Jack for the day but disaster strikes when they accidentally bring home a baby girl. Jason spots this, and just as they are about to swap the babies back, Kevin walks in and demands the truth. Jason admits what happened and Kevin goes looking for his son. He finds Jack but warns Rosie to stay away, expressing his disappointment in her. Despite this, Jason is good friends with Kevin and supports him when he wins \u00a3200,000 on a [[scratchcard]]. When Kevin is almost crushed to death at the garage when his new car ramp malfunctions, Jason joins Rosie and her family at the hospital. Kevin orders Jason to call the ramp manufacturers to find the fault and threaten legal action if necessary. When it's revealed that the ramp was damaged deliberately, Jason is shocked and disgusted that someone would try to kill Kevin.\n\nIn June, Jason celebrates his 28th birthday and Becky hosts a party for him in the Rovers. However, she orders a stripper and the party turns to all-out mayhem when [[Chris Gray (Coronation Street)|Chris Gray]] ([[Will Thorp]]) has a go at [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]). A fight breaks out and this leads to a whole pub brawl, with Jason caught in the middle, things sent flying, the brawl going onto the street and a chair smashing the window. Though Jason is shaken, he is fine. In November 2011, Rosie tells Jason that she is showing a potential buyer around their flat (which they are selling), but they are unaware that the mystery buyer is actually Rosie's ex-kidnapper, [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), who has returned to kidnap Rosie as he blames her for his wife, Fiz, being imprisoned for his crimes. Rosie and Jason have a brief argument which leads to her storming off to show 'Mr Chips' around the flat. Meanwhile, Jason informs Kevin that Rosie never returned from the flat viewing and he is concerned. Jason and Kevin hear Rosie's screams and find her bound and gagged in the flat and Kevin chases after John, who then crashes his car and dies. Jason apologises to Rosie for abandoning her and says he'll never do it again. Rosie gets an offer for a show in London however she has to be single to enter the show. She realises she has to follow her career and breaks up with Jason.\n\nJason rekindles his relationship with [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) however she later shares a kiss with her gay best friend [[Marcus Dent]] ([[Charlie Condou]]), who is actually dating Aiden. They later fail to resist temptation and sleep together. The pair dump their boyfriends, Aiden and Jason. Realising they are in love, they agree to give their relationship a go. In December 2012, Jason starts a relationship with [[Stella Price]], after repairing a water leak in the Rovers Return, yet she rekindles her relationship with [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]). However, Jason is convinced that Karl is responsible for starting the fire at the Rovers Return which killed [[Sunita Alahan]]. He tells Sunita's husband [[Dev Alahan]] and he initially ignores him. But, as clues build up, he begins to believe him. Just after Karl and Stella's wedding takes place, Dev locks himself in the newly built Rovers Return and he confesses to killing Dev's wife Sunita. Meanwhile, Jason is at the police station reporting Karl for murder. In the pub, Dev begins to punch Karl and he retaliates by smashing him around the head with a bottle. Stella enters through the back of the pub and finds Dev on the floor surrounded by shattered glass. Karl refuses to let her call an ambulance and locks her in the basement. The police come to the pub and Karl is arrested. Dev recovers quickly. Impressed by his concern for her mother Stella, [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) shares a kiss with Jason in September 2013, and they later begin a serious relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-08/coronation-street-spoilers-eva-price-and-jason-grimshaw-get-passionate---first-look-pictures|title=Coronation Street spoilers: Eva Price and Jason Grimshaw get passionate - first look pictures|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Tony (Terence Maynard) turns up at the Eileen's house, wanting to rekindle his relationship with Jason. He begins a relationship with Eileen's friend, [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]), and she is angry to discover that Tony is giving Liz more attention than he is his own son. Tony, still not convinced that he is a good enough father, decides to purchase the builder's yard from [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), who is desperately trying to pay off his \u00a380,000 debt. When a \u00a375,000 deal is reached, Tony signs the builder's yard over to Jason, to say sorry for not watching him grow up. He also buys the flat next door, which he rents to [[Andy Carver]] ([[Oliver Farnworth]]) and [[Steph Britton]] (Tisha Merry). Tony begins to work at the builder's yard with Jason, taking on an executive role. They later employ Jason's friend, [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) and [[Zeedan Nazir]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]), as labourers. After Jason's brother, Todd, returns to Weatherfield, Tony employs him, as a secretary at the builder's yard, but he puts the company at risk, after ordering cheap materials to make a loft conversion for Jason's friend, Tyrone. Matters turn worse when Tyrone falls through the roof, breaks his ribs and sues 'Jason's Construction'. When Jason discovers what Todd has done and that Jason and Gary knew what he was up to, he fires all three of them, leaving only Zeedan working at the builder's yard and, unable to live in the same house as Todd, for what he has done, Jason moves into the flat above the kebab shop with Eva. After realising that what happened to him was not Jason's fault, Tyrone decides to accept Tony's \u00a35,000 compensation and forgives Jason.\n\nWhen Todd is disowned by Eileen, he moves into a run-down flat, but he later gets a job at Barlow's Buys, impressing Eileen, who realises that he is trying to make amends, but Jason is not convinced. Eileen agrees to lunch with Todd, at 'Nick's Bistro', but when Jason talks her out of it, Todd realises that he has been stood up and heads home. As Todd walks home, he is attacked by a gang of youths and ends up in hospital, where he discovers that his face will be scared for life. Eileen and Jason, believing that Todd truly wants to change, forgive him and he moves back in with Eileen. However, Todd vows revenge on the pair, for not turning up to lunch at the bistro, as he thinks that they are the reason that he was attacked. As time passes, Eva plans for her and Jason to buy a house, but after Jason reveals that he cannot afford it, Eva asks Tony to lend them the deposit, to which he agrees. When Tony and Eva attend an auction at a hotel, Todd lets on to Jason that they are having an affair, to which Jason goes to the hotel and punches Tony and calls Eva a 'dirty slag'. When Jason realises that he has made a mistake and that Tony and Eva were actually planning on buying a house, to surprise him, Eva dumps Jason, for not trusting her. Although he pleads for her forgiveness and even proposes to her, Eva decides to leave for [[France]], in order to think things through, but Jason is devastated, after discovering from her sister, [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), that Eva is now happily engaged to a French man.\n\nIn August 2015, Jason stands up for Sarah against [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward), but the result of this leads to Jason getting beaten up by Callum and two of his goons. Jason is left in a critical condition as a result, having to receive vital surgery on a clot on his brain. He regains consciousness a week later and tells Tony and the [[Police]] he thinks he heard Callum's voice. Jason spends 2 more weeks in hospital. In September, he gets Callum's home address from [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] and hides in his flat. However, Denton arrives and demands money from Callum, but Jason's phone rings, causing them to find him. Jason punches Callum after Tony arrives to take him home.\n\nEva returns in September 2015 and rekindles with Jason, however she becomes upset when Jason throws her out for feeling sorry for him. In 2016 Jason found out that his father Tony had died of a heart attack. Jason blamed Liz McDonald for Tony's death, which he said that if it was not for Liz Tony would not have left and that Tony could have been saved. In May 2016, after being rejected by Eva, he took Callum's friend [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) home with him. In the coming weeks, Callum's body is found. He is initially a suspect but is ruled out when they believe it was Tony. Gemma then tells him she knows it's not his fault but he should watch his back as his dad did it and people will take revenge on him. His van is then torched and he believes it is one of Callum's friends but it is actually his mother's partner [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) who is pretending that it's them to scare him and take his business. Phelan tells him he should leave to which he agrees and lets him 'look after' the business unknown that he is actually conning him even though Todd has figured him out. Before going, he goes to say goodbye to Sarah in a mental hospital where she has been committed because of being paranoid over Callum (unbeknown to Jason, she witnessed his murder at the hands of her sister-in-law, [[Kylie Platt|Kylie]]) and being diagnosed with [[postpartum psychosis]]. He goes back home and says an emotional farewell to Todd, Eileen and Sean before going to Thailand.\n\n==Casting==\n[[File:Ryan Thomas 2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Ryan Thomas has portrayed Jason since he was seventeen.]]\nIn late 2000, it was announced that two younger boys were to join the cast of ''Coronation Street''.

Jason was originally going to be called James. The family moved into [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] and [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]]'s old house on the street.

Speaking of the storyline Thomas said: \"Jason was thinking about getting married in four years rather than four months. It was just a gesture, and that\u2019s all he wanted it to be. He thought they would just get engaged and they didn\u2019t have to get married for ages yet. It was more of a stepping stone for him. It has come round quickly for Jason, and he is sort of being pushed into it. He doesn\u2019t want to lose Sarah so he is going along with it because he does actually love her.\" Asked if Jason would settle down Thomas also said: \"He's had a bit of a past and he's a bit of a Jack The Lad around Charlie but on this occasion, for once, he's actually showing some grown-up qualities and, when faced with the prospect of losing Sarah, he chose to bite the bullet. There's no grey area with Jason because there's not that much grey matter! Everything's in black and white. It's either marry Sarah and keep her or don't marry Sarah and lose her forever.\" Speaking about if Jason will also be able to handle Bethany, Thomas said: \"He certainly will \u2013 he pulls her to one side during the ceremony and makes her a pledge. He realises he can't have Sarah without Beth \u2013 they come as a package.\" The storyline resulted in Jason leaving Sarah and also resulted in Sarah leaving the street for a new life abroad with Beth. leaving Jason alone and upset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a35748/ryan-thomas.html|title=Ryan Thomas|last=Green|first=Kris|date=11 August 2006|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Tina O'Brien.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Jason had a relationship with [[Sarah Platt]] played by [[Tina O'Brien]] (''pictured'').]]In 2009, Jason began dating [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]]'s ex-girlfriend [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Speaking of the storyline, Thomas said \"I just thought it was really good for their storylines because I knew it'd bring the Platts and the Grimshaws back together in their usual warring ways. Who could forget the famous fight on the cobbles between Gail and Eileen? I think at some point that'll come again. There's always banter from one side of the Street to the other.\" Asked what attracts Tina to Jason, Thomas replied: \"I think it's because she's quite full-on with Jason. She made a big effort with him in the beginning, so he just played off that and spiced up his life a bit in the process. He wanted a bit more fun than just sitting there having a pint in The Rovers every day.\" It all came a little out of the blue, did not it? \"Yeah, Jason completely wasn't aware that Tina fancied him. She had to come onto him to make him realise, but as soon as he got the sign, he was in there! It doesn't take him long to get his pants off!

Speaking of the romance, Tyldesley said to ''[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'': \"She's never really entertained the thought of anything serious with Jason in the past, obviously especially because he used to be with her mum. But she just begins to see that he's a really genuine, nice sweet guy. \"Whilst Jason and Eva are trying to help Stella out, there is a little bit of flirting that starts, and Sean kindly points out to Eva how fit Jason is! She continued: \"We can expect, as always, a lot more drama for the Prices.

Jason's storylines have mostly revolved around his relationships with various women including, [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]), [[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]), [[Violet Wilson]] ([[Jenny Platt]]), [[Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) and [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]). His other storylines have included being attacked by [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward); grieving for his father, Tony, after he dies off-screen; and becoming a suspect in Callum's murder. He leaves Weatherfield after being manipulated to by his mother's new boyfriend, [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre).\n\n==Storylines==\nJason is the son of [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] ([[Alan Igbon]]/Terence Maynard). Jason does not know his father for many years, but they reunite in 2003. Upon his arrival, he is an aspiring runner - something which Eileen does not completely approve of. He works for a brief period in [[Sally Webster]]'s ([[Sally Dynevor]]) electrical shop in 2001 until the failing business catches fire and is permanently closed down. He finds  a traumatised [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) lying in the ginnel, following her rape in April 2001, while out jogging early one morning.\n\nAlthough Jason has had many romances, all of them were short-lived since he has phobia to commitment. He has had many flings with street residents, [[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) and [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]). He seemed to have settled down with [[Violet Wilson]] ([[Jenny Platt]]), even uncharacteristically promising to care for her when he thought she was pregnant. Jason is stunned to learn about Violet sharing a drunken kiss with his friend/employer, [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). He attempts to continue the relationship but is unable to forgive Violet and ends their relationship. During their separation, he starts dating Sarah and despite reconciling with Violet, he continues his affair with her. Eventually, Violet discovers the affair and dumps Jason. Separated from Violet again, Jason and Sarah continue their relationship, much to the dismay of their mothers. Their relationship struggles initially as Sarah feels insecure about his feelings for Violet and the fact he proposed to Sarah while still with Violet, leading to a showdown in which Sarah ends her relationship with Jason in the Rovers. After days of constant quarrels, Jason ultimately decides to get back with Sarah and after she refuses to speak to him, Jason breaks into her house and proposes. She accepts, although they suffer further disapproval from their mothers. They announce their engagement in the Rovers in Violet's presence, which Sarah wants to do to make a point. The wedding, though, is a disaster. Jason decides he cannot commit and flees through a toilet window at the venue, leaving Sarah heartbroken. After months of ignoring Jason, Sarah reunites with him. However, on [[Christmas Day]] 2006, Jason has a major surprise delivered to the front door in the shape of a baby - his little girl by a young woman called Emma ([[Stephanie Waring]]). It later turns out that baby Holly is the baby of [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]].\n\nOut of revenge for his family disowning him, David loosens the bolts on the scaffolding at the builder's yard on 22 October 2007, a week before Jason and Sarah's wedding. Later, David decides that it was a bad idea, however he gets to the builder's yard to see Jason leaning on the balcony. When Bill jumps on him as a joke, the two of them fall onto the street below, Bill on top of Jason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/soaps/corry/corry-42541.html|title=Coronation Street-Jason Falls From The Scaffolding|publisher=}}</ref> In the hospital, Jason is told that he might not walk again for some time. He is on crutches at his and Sarah's wedding.\n\nSarah asks Jason to take her wedding dress to the cleaners but he accidentally leaves it in ''Roy's Rolls'' where David picks it up and puts it in a puddle before putting it in a bin bag with other bits and pieces that the Morton kids get from their neighbours. The Mortons' Guy Fawkes gets first prize and, as the dress burns, Sarah recognizes it as her wedding dress before Jason admits that he lost it. Sarah knows immediately that this is David's doing. Jason, Sarah and her daughter [[Bethany Platt|Bethany]] (Amy & Emily Walton) are set to leave for Milan on 30 December 2007, after Sarah gets a job from her uncle Stephen (Todd Boyce). Jason backs out when Sarah admits that she planted drugs in David's drawer at the salon, thereby ruining his chances of Stephen offering him the job in Milan.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2007, Jason and [[Becky McDonald|Becky Granger]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) kiss as the midnight bells chimes, and on 1 February 2008, they have sex. Jason regrets it afterwards and visits Sarah in Milan to tell her he had cheated on her with Becky. Instead of forgiving him, she attacks him, giving him a black eye. When he returns to the Street, Becky hits him too.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/events/is-liam-yet-another-love-rat/|title=Is Liam yet another love rat|work=[[What's on TV?]]|date=25 January 2008|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, Jason and Becky have sex again and they become a couple. However, they argue when Jason wants a night in alone. In October 2008, Jason discovers that Sarah is considering coming home. He immediately phones her and she agrees to give him another chance. Meanwhile, he is preparing to move in with Becky but dumps her and flies to Italy. Becky later attacks him in the Rovers for his betrayal.<ref>{{cite web|author=Published Thursday, 4 Sep 2008, 09:57 BST |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a129214/corrie-prepares-for-dramatic-fight-scene.html |title=Corrie prepares for dramatic fight scene - Coronation Street News - Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Everything backfires for Jason when he subsequently discovers that Sarah has decided to reconcile with her Italian boyfriend, just as he is going to Milan to meet her. On 16 February 2009, Jason and Becky sleep together and reunite after revealing that he and Sarah are divorcing. To prove to Becky that he is serious this time, he proposes and she accepts. Unfortunately, [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) also proposes to Becky and although she initially decides to marry Jason, she realises she can not go through with it and calls off the engagement.\n\nIn June 2009, Jason sleeps with David's ex-girlfriend [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). They start dating, however when Tina tells David the truth about her and Jason, he turns nasty and starts throwing bricks at Jason. Jason fights back and the pair have to be separated by the locals. Tina and Jason buy No. 12a Coronation Street and move in together in July 2009. Jason and Tina redecorate the flat and hold a house-warming party in September 2009 but in November, a loan shark named [[Rick Neelan]] fakes interest in buying the flat, when he is actually waiting for Tina's father, [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe]] ([[Reece Dinsdale]]), about the debt he owes him. Before Christmas 2009, Tina and Jason row after it is discovered that Jason is still married to Sarah. In retaliation, she shares a kiss with [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), his brother-in-law. They reconcile however, and in January 2010, when Joe and Gail go on their honeymoon, he asks Jason to look out for Tina, who is in danger from the loan sharks. On 12 February, Jason gives Tina a [[Valentine's Day]] present of his divorce papers to Sarah. Tina thinks that is her full Valentine's Day present and goes to get alcohol to celebrate. When she returns, Jason proposes to her after she has seen the ring and she accepts. However, following Joe's sudden death, Tina struggles with her grief and ends her engagement to Jason and he moves out of the flat, though he reclaims it.\n\nOn 2 April 2010, Jason gets drunk in the Rovers after Tina calls off their engagement. He later returns to the builder's yard where he is told to go home. However, when he turns to leave, Jason falls down the stairs <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/coronation-street/episodes/jason-falls-down-the-stairs|title=Jason falls down the stairs! - Episode - Coronation Street - What's on TV|publisher=}}</ref> and is rendered unconscious. He is taken to the [[hospital]] where he appears to be fine, apart from losing the memory of him and Tina breaking up. Eileen, worried about what he'll do, visits Tina's house where she informs her of Jason's [[amnesia]], but Tina doesn't believe her. Jason's memory soon returns.\n\nUpon finding out Tina is now dating [[Graeme Proctor]], he is angry that Tina slept with Graeme while she was with him and locks her out of the flat. Then he teams up with David (who was Graeme's best friend) to humiliate Tina and Graeme further; first by David using Graeme's clothes to mop up water (Graeme had handcuffed David to the Platts' radiator, and David then pulled it off the wall.) David then cut the hoods off Graeme's hoodies and the peaks off his caps and Jason throws binbags of Tina's clothes on top of her from the house's windows, all in front of a crowd. Satisfied, David and Jason end their partnership but remain close friends.\n\nOn 24 September 2010, Jason is recruited by a half-naked [[Rosie Webster]] to drive her in [[Kevin Webster|Kevin]]'s car to Sheffield to pick up [[Sophie Webster|Sophie]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) and her girlfriend [[Sian Powers|Sian]] ([[Sacha Parkinson]]) after they ran away together. Immediately, there is chemistry between the pair; on 18 October, Rosie books [[Owen Armstrong|Owen]] to come round and redecorate the kitchen after the oven catches fire whilst Sally and Kevin are away. On the 21st, whilst Jason is busy with the Websters' kitchen, and Rosie is looking for a cab to take her to an important modelling job, she mentions that it is 'underwear modelling', so Jason offers to be her driver. With Jason not knowing what a 'green screen' is and the male model going AWOL, Rosie volunteers Jason to step in, and the pair complete the photoshoot together; with Jason looking very pleased with himself when they get home, they sleep together. The next day, Jason thinks he has done something wrong as Rosie is evasive and not paying him for the work he did on the kitchen; she eventually pays him and he buys her a 'fake' version of the handbag that she wanted and the pair sleep together again and agree to start dating.\n\nWhen the Joinery bar exploded, bringing a tram off the viaduct which smashes into the Corner Shop and ''The Kabin'', Jason helps to rescue people who are trapped, including going into No.13 (which is in flames) to find [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]). He finds him in a closet upstairs and they both escape, assisted by the fire brigade.  Upon escaping, he is thanked gratefully by the Barlow family and praised by the residents for his courage. With Jason and Rosie living together, they start the new year looking out for Sophie and Sian as they get kicked out of the Websters. When Graeme convinces Claire to run away after she admits to the police that she attacked [[Tracy Barlow]], Jason helps her and her sons escape and drives her to the airport, on 14 January. On 17 January, Eileen's money troubles get a lot worse, and number 11 starts crumbling around her; she seeks help from an insurance firm but when Jason spots a man lurking at the back of the house, he thinks he is trying to spy on Rosie and punches him, only to discover that he is the insurance inspector, which of course, affects the result and Eileen can not claim a penny.\n\nOn 4 February, after Rosie agrees to go to a \"mother and baby\" photo shoot, which \"pays a fortune\", they convince Kevin to let them have Jack for the day but disaster strikes when they accidentally bring home a baby girl. Jason spots this, and just as they are about to swap the babies back, Kevin walks in and demands the truth. Jason admits what happened and Kevin goes looking for his son. He finds Jack but warns Rosie to stay away, expressing his disappointment in her. Despite this, Jason is good friends with Kevin and supports him when he wins \u00a3200,000 on a [[scratchcard]]. When Kevin is almost crushed to death at the garage when his new car ramp malfunctions, Jason joins Rosie and her family at the hospital. Kevin orders Jason to call the ramp manufacturers to find the fault and threaten legal action if necessary. When it's revealed that the ramp was damaged deliberately, Jason is shocked and disgusted that someone would try to kill Kevin.\n\nIn June, Jason celebrates his 28th birthday and Becky hosts a party for him in the Rovers. However, she orders a stripper and the party turns to all-out mayhem when [[Chris Gray (Coronation Street)|Chris Gray]] ([[Will Thorp]]) has a go at [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]). A fight breaks out and this leads to a whole pub brawl, with Jason caught in the middle, things sent flying, the brawl going onto the street and a chair smashing the window. Though Jason is shaken, he is fine. In November 2011, Rosie tells Jason that she is showing a potential buyer around their flat (which they are selling), but they are unaware that the mystery buyer is actually Rosie's ex-kidnapper, [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), who has returned to kidnap Rosie as he blames her for his wife, Fiz, being imprisoned for his crimes. Rosie and Jason have a brief argument which leads to her storming off to show 'Mr Chips' around the flat. Meanwhile, Jason informs Kevin that Rosie never returned from the flat viewing and he is concerned. Jason and Kevin hear Rosie's screams and find her bound and gagged in the flat and Kevin chases after John, who then crashes his car and dies. Jason apologises to Rosie for abandoning her and says he'll never do it again. Rosie gets an offer for a show in London however she has to be single to enter the show. She realises she has to follow her career and breaks up with Jason.\n\nJason rekindles his relationship with [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) however she later shares a kiss with her gay best friend [[Marcus Dent]] ([[Charlie Condou]]), who is actually dating Aiden. They later fail to resist temptation and sleep together. The pair dump their boyfriends, Aiden and Jason. Realising they are in love, they agree to give their relationship a go. In December 2012, Jason starts a relationship with [[Stella Price]], after repairing a water leak in the Rovers Return, yet she rekindles her relationship with [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]). However, Jason is convinced that Karl is responsible for starting the fire at the Rovers Return which killed [[Sunita Alahan]]. He tells Sunita's husband [[Dev Alahan]] and he initially ignores him. But, as clues build up, he begins to believe him. Just after Karl and Stella's wedding takes place, Dev locks himself in the newly built Rovers Return and he confesses to killing Dev's wife Sunita. Meanwhile, Jason is at the police station reporting Karl for murder. In the pub, Dev begins to punch Karl and he retaliates by smashing him around the head with a bottle. Stella enters through the back of the pub and finds Dev on the floor surrounded by shattered glass. Karl refuses to let her call an ambulance and locks her in the basement. The police come to the pub and Karl is arrested. Dev recovers quickly. Impressed by his concern for her mother Stella, [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) shares a kiss with Jason in September 2013, and they later begin a serious relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-08/coronation-street-spoilers-eva-price-and-jason-grimshaw-get-passionate---first-look-pictures|title=Coronation Street spoilers: Eva Price and Jason Grimshaw get passionate - first look pictures|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Tony (Terence Maynard) turns up at the Eileen's house, wanting to rekindle his relationship with Jason. He begins a relationship with Eileen's friend, [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]), and she is angry to discover that Tony is giving Liz more attention than he is his own son. Tony, still not convinced that he is a good enough father, decides to purchase the builder's yard from [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]), who is desperately trying to pay off his \u00a380,000 debt. When a \u00a375,000 deal is reached, Tony signs the builder's yard over to Jason, to say sorry for not watching him grow up. He also buys the flat next door, which he rents to [[Andy Carver]] ([[Oliver Farnworth]]) and [[Steph Britton]] (Tisha Merry). Tony begins to work at the builder's yard with Jason, taking on an executive role. They later employ Jason's friend, [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) and [[Zeedan Nazir]] ([[Qasim Akhtar]]), as labourers. After Jason's brother, Todd, returns to Weatherfield, Tony employs him, as a secretary at the builder's yard, but he puts the company at risk, after ordering cheap materials to make a loft conversion for Jason's friend, Tyrone. Matters turn worse when Tyrone falls through the roof, breaks his ribs and sues 'Jason's Construction'. When Jason discovers what Todd has done and that Jason and Gary knew what he was up to, he fires all three of them, leaving only Zeedan working at the builder's yard and, unable to live in the same house as Todd, for what he has done, Jason moves into the flat above the kebab shop with Eva. After realising that what happened to him was not Jason's fault, Tyrone decides to accept Tony's \u00a35,000 compensation and forgives Jason.\n\nWhen Todd is disowned by Eileen, he moves into a run-down flat, but he later gets a job at Barlow's Buys, impressing Eileen, who realises that he is trying to make amends, but Jason is not convinced. Eileen agrees to lunch with Todd, at 'Nick's Bistro', but when Jason talks her out of it, Todd realises that he has been stood up and heads home. As Todd walks home, he is attacked by a gang of youths and ends up in hospital, where he discovers that his face will be scared for life. Eileen and Jason, believing that Todd truly wants to change, forgive him and he moves back in with Eileen. However, Todd vows revenge on the pair, for not turning up to lunch at the bistro, as he thinks that they are the reason that he was attacked. As time passes, Eva plans for her and Jason to buy a house, but after Jason reveals that he cannot afford it, Eva asks Tony to lend them the deposit, to which he agrees. When Tony and Eva attend an auction at a hotel, Todd lets on to Jason that they are having an affair, to which Jason goes to the hotel and punches Tony and calls Eva a 'dirty slag'. When Jason realises that he has made a mistake and that Tony and Eva were actually planning on buying a house, to surprise him, Eva dumps Jason, for not trusting her. Although he pleads for her forgiveness and even proposes to her, Eva decides to leave for [[France]], in order to think things through, but Jason is devastated, after discovering from her sister, [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), that Eva is now happily engaged to a French man.\n\nIn August 2015, Jason stands up for Sarah against [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward), but the result of this leads to Jason getting beaten up by Callum and two of his goons. Jason is left in a critical condition as a result, having to receive vital surgery on a clot on his brain. He regains consciousness a week later and tells Tony and the [[Police]] he thinks he heard Callum's voice. Jason spends 2 more weeks in hospital. In September, he gets Callum's home address from [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] and hides in his flat. However, Denton arrives and demands money from Callum, but Jason's phone rings, causing them to find him. Jason punches Callum after Tony arrives to take him home.\n\nEva returns in September 2015 and rekindles with Jason, however she becomes upset when Jason throws her out for feeling sorry for him. In 2016 Jason found out that his father Tony had died of a heart attack. Jason blamed Liz McDonald for Tony's death, which he said that if it was not for Liz Tony would not have left and that Tony could have been saved. In May 2016, after being rejected by Eva, he took Callum's friend [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) home with him. In the coming weeks, Callum's body is found. He is initially a suspect but is ruled out when they believe it was Tony. Gemma then tells him she knows it's not his fault but he should watch his back as his dad did it and people will take revenge on him. His van is then torched and he believes it is one of Callum's friends but it is actually his mother's partner [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) who is pretending that it's them to scare him and take his business. Phelan tells him he should leave to which he agrees and lets him 'look after' the business unknown that he is actually conning him even though Todd has figured him out. Before going, he goes to say goodbye to Sarah in a mental hospital where she has been committed because of being paranoid over Callum (unbeknown to Jason, she witnessed his murder at the hands of her sister-in-law, [[Kylie Platt|Kylie]]) and being diagnosed with [[postpartum psychosis]]. He goes back home and says an emotional farewell to Todd, Eileen and Sean before going to Thailand.\n\n==Casting==\n[[File:Ryan Thomas 2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Ryan Thomas has portrayed Jason since he was seventeen.]]\nIn late 2000, it was announced that two younger boys were to join the cast of ''Coronation Street''.

He wanted a bit more fun than just sitting there having a pint in The Rovers every day.\" It all came a little out of the blue, did not it? \"Yeah, Jason completely wasn't aware that Tina fancied him. She had to come onto him to make him realise, but as soon as he got the sign, he was in there! It doesn't take him long to get his pants off!

The name was also used from 1941 to 1944, during Axis occupation, for the short-lived political entity (see: [[Banat (1941\u201344)]]), which covered only today's Serbian part of the historical Banat.\n\nThe name ''Banat'' is similar in different languages of the region; {{lang-ro|Banat}}, {{lang-sh|Banat}} / {{lang|sh-Cyrl|\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442}} ({{IPA-sh|b\u01cena\u02d0t|pron}}), {{lang-hu|B\u00e1n\u00e1t}} or ''{{lang|hu|B\u00e1ns\u00e1g}}'', {{lang-bg|\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442}}, {{lang-de|Banat}}, {{lang-uk|\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442}}, {{lang-tr|Banat}}, {{lang-sk|Ban\u00e1t}}, {{lang-cs|Ban\u00e1t}}, {{lang-el|\u0392\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''V\u00e0naton''.

The climate, except in the marshy parts, is generally healthy. [[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[maize]], [[flax]], [[hemp]] and [[tobacco]] are grown in large quantities, and the products of the vineyards are of a good quality. Game is plentiful and the rivers swarm with fish. The mineral wealth is great, including [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron]] and especially [[coal]]. Amongst its numerous mineral springs, the most important are those of Mehadia, with sulphurous waters, which were already known in the Roman period as the Termae Herculis (''[[B\u0103ile Herculane]]''). The present \"Banat Region\" of Romania includes some areas that are mountainous and were not part of the historical Banat or of the Pannonian plain.\n\nIn Serbia, the Banat is mostly plains. [[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[maize]], [[hemp]] and [[sunflower]] are grown, and mineral wealth consists of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]]. A popular tourist destination in the Banat is [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]]. There are also several ethnic minorities in the region, including Hungarians (10.21% of the population), Romanians, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Roma people, and others.\n\n== History ==\n{{History of Banat}} \n{{For|earlier events|Prehistory of Transylvania|Prehistory of Romania|Prehistoric Serbia|Prehistoric Hungary}}\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n{{Main|Scordisci|Dacia|Celts|Celts in Transylvania|Roman Empire|Roman Dacia|Ancient history of Transylvania}}\n\nThe first known inhabitants of present-day Banat were the [[Neolithic]] populations. In the 4th century BC, [[Celtic tribes]] settled in this area. Various [[Hallstatt]] and [[La T\u00e8ne]] objects were found in this area. The most important tribes were the [[Scordisci]] and the [[Taurisci]]. The Scordisci, who formed a powerful state even minted their own coins, imitating the Macedonian tetradrachm. The [[Scordisci]] subdued as all the other tribes in the region to the getic ruler [[Burebista]], therefore their region was part of the [[Dacia]]n kingdom under [[Burebista]] in the first century BC, but the balance of power in the area partially changed during the campaigns of [[Augustus]]. At the beginning of the 2nd century A.D., [[Trajan]] led two wars against the Dacians: the campaigns of 101\u2013102, and 105\u2013106. Eventually, the territory of Banat fell under Roman rule. It became an important link between [[Dacia (Roman province)|Dacia]] province and the other parts of the Empire. Roman rule had a significant impact: [[castra]] and guard stations were established and roads and public buildings built. The public bath establishments of Ad Aquas Herculis, modern-day [[B\u0103ile Herculane]] were also established. Some of the important Roman settlements in Banat were: [[Arcidava (castrum)|Arcidava]] (today [[V\u0103r\u0103dia]]), Centum Putea (today [[Surducu Mare]]), Berzobis (today [[Berzovia]]), Tibiscum (today [[Jupa]]), Agnaviae (today [[Z\u0103voi]]), Ad Pannonios (today [[Teregova]]), Praetorium (today [[Mehadia]]), and Dierna (today [[Or\u0219ova]]).\n\nIn 273 A.D. Emperor [[Aurelian]] withdrew the Roman Army from Dacia. The area fell into the hands of [[foederati]] such as the [[Sarmatians]] ([[Iazyges]], [[Roxolani]], [[Limigantes]]) and later the [[Goths]], who also took control of other parts of Dacia.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Indo Europeans Vojvodina map.png|Ancient Indo-European peoples in Banat\nFile:Roman cities Vojvodina.png|Ancient Roman cities in Banat\n</gallery>\n\n=== Migration Period and Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Main|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Serbia in the Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians|Slavs}}\nThe [[Goths]] were forced out by the [[Huns]], who organized their ruling center in the [[Pannonian Basin]] (the [[Pannonian Plain]]), an area that included the northwestern part of today's Banat. After the death of [[Attila]], the Hunnic empire disintegrated in days. The previously subjected [[Gepids]] formed a new kingdom in the area, only to be defeated 100 years later by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]].\n\nOne governing center of the Avars was formed in the region, which played an important role in the Avar\u2013Byzantine wars. An inscription on one of the vessels from the [[Treasure of S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]] (which origin is disputed) recorded names of two local rulers, [[Butaul]] and [[Buyla]], who bore [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ruling titles of [[\u017eupan]]. The Avar rule over the area lasted until the 9th century, until [[Charlemagne]]'s campaigns. The Banat region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] a few decades later. Archaeological evidence shows the Avars and Gepids lived here until the middle of the 10th century. The Avar rule had  triggered considerable [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] migration to the southern Pannonian plain and to the Balkans.\n\nIn 895, the [[Hungarians]] living in [[Etelk\u00f6z]] entered the Byzantine-Bulgarian war as allies of Byzantium, and defeated the Bulgars. Because of this, the Bulgarians allied with the [[Pecheneg]]s, who attacked the Hungarian settlements. This led to the process of what is known as the Hungarian conquest of the Pannonian basin, referred to by them as \"hometaking\" (''{{lang|hu|honfoglal\u00e1s}}'') in Hungarian. This also resulted in the loss of part of the territories north of the Danube for the [[Bulgarian empire]].\n\nAccording to ''Gesta Hungarorum'' chronicle, a local ruler known as Glad ruled over the Banat and his army was formed by Vlachs, Bulgarians and Cumans<ref name=\"Madgearu 1998, p. 191-207\">Madgearu, Alexandru - Geneza \u0219i evolu\u021bia voievodatului b\u0103n\u0103\u021bean din secolul al X-lea.(Origins and evolution of Banat duchy in the 19th century).

When nomadic Hungarians came to Transylvania there was no direct Bulgarian political rule there.<ref>Victor Spinei, The Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth to the Mid-Thirteenth Century (East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages), 450\u20131450, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2009 p.59, {{ISBN|9789004175365}},</ref> In the eastern part of the Pannonian basin among Christians, the [[Byzantine rite]] became more influential after Ahtum's conversion to Christianity. This was halted with the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. [[Stephen I of Hungary|Istv\u00e1n I]] reasserted dominance over the last local leader, [[Ahtum]] (Ajtony in other sources). Ahtum was a semi-independent ruler of Banat and an Orthodox Christian. Ahtum constructed a Byzantine monastery at Morisena. His vassal [[Csan\u00e1d]] defeated him by the will of King Stephen I of Hungary. The territory of the modern Banat did not form a separate territorial unit in medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]], it was an integral part of it. The territory was shared by [[Krass\u00f3 County|Krass\u00f3]], [[Keve County|Keve]], [[Temes County|Temes]], [[Csan\u00e1d County (medieval)|Csan\u00e1d]], [[Arad County (former)|Arad]] and [[Toront\u00e1l County|Toront\u00e1l Counties]].\n\nIn 1233, under the Kingdom of Hungary administration, the [[Banate of Severin]], a military frontier area was formed, including some eastern parts of the modern Banat. In the 14th century, the region became of priority concern to the Kingdom, as the southern border of the Banat was the most important defensive line against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] expansion from the Southeast.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Salan glad01.png|Duchy of [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], 9th century\nFile:Ahtum sermon03 01.png|Duchy of [[Ahtum]], 11th century\nFile:Koh administrative 1370 01.png|Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary in present-day Banat region in the 14th century\nFile:Banate of severin.png|Banate of Severin\n</gallery>\n\n=== Ottoman administration (1552\u20131716) ===\n[[File:After the capture of Temesv\u00e1r, 1552.jpg|thumb|190px|After the capture of Temesv\u00e1r, 1552]]\n{{Main|Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar|Early Modern Romania|Ottoman Serbia}}\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] took over the area and incorporated the Banat in 1552. It was absorbed as an Ottoman [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]] (province) named the [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]]. The Banat region was mainly populated by [[Rascians]] ([[Serbs]]) in the west and [[Vlachs]] ([[Romanians]]) in the east; thus, in some historical sources it was referred to as ''Rascia'' and in others ''Wallachia''{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2016}}. Numerous Ottoman Muslims settled in the area, living mostly in the cities and associated with trade and administration.\n\nNot all of the Banat fell immediately under Turkish rule. Eastern regions around [[Lugoj]] and [[Caransebe\u0219]] came under the rule of Princes of Transylvania. In that area, a new banate was formed, known as the [[Banate of Lugoj and Caransebe\u0219]].\n\nIn the spring of 1594, shortly after the beginning of [[Long Turkish War|Austro-Turkish War (1593-1606)]], Serbian Christians{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the nationality of the insurgents|date=November 2016}} in [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]] started an [[Uprising in Banat|Uprising]] against Turkish rule. The local Romanians also participated in this uprising. At first, rebels were successful. They took the city of [[Vr\u0161ac]] and various other towns in Banat and started negotiations with Prince of Transylvania. One of the leaders of the uprising was local Serbian Orthodox Bishop [[Teodor of Vr\u0161ac|Theodore]].{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=141-142}}\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century, the territory of [[Banate of Lugoj and Caransebe\u0219]] finally fell under Turkish rule and was incorporated into [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]].\n\nDuring [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Turkish War (1683-1699)]], local Serbian uprisings broke out in various parts of [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]]. Austrian armies and Serbian militia tried to drive out sultans army from the province, but Turks succeeded in holding the fort of Temesv\u00e1r. In 1689, Serbian patriarch [[Arsenije III \u010carnojevi\u0107|Arsenije III]] sided with Austrians. His jurisdiction (including the province) was officially recognized by the charters of emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in 1690, 1691 and 1695.

After the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718), the region became a province of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was not incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. Special provincial administration was established, centered in Temesv\u00e1r.\n\nIn 1738, over 50 Romanian villages from Serbia and Banat were destroyed and dwellers murdered by Austrians and Serb militia during a revolt of Romanians.<ref>Picot, Emile, Les serbes de Hongrie, leur histoire, leurs privileges, leur \u00e9glise, leur \u00e9tat politique et social.

It remained a separate province within the Habsburg Monarchy and under military administration until 1751, when Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] reorganized the province, dividing it between military and civil administration. The Banat of Temeswar province was abolished in 1778, when civilian part of the region was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary and divided into counties. The southern part of the Banat region remained within the [[Military Frontier]] ([[Banat Krajina]]) until the Frontier was abolished in 1871.\n\nDuring the Ottoman rule, parts of Banat had a low population density due to years of warfare, and some local residents also lost their lives during Habsburg-Ottoman wars and Prince Eugene of Savoy's conquest. Much of the area had reverted to nearly uninhabited marsh, heath and forest. Count [[Claudius Mercy]] (1666\u20131734), who was appointed governor of the Banat of Temeswar in 1720, took numerous measures for the regeneration of the Banat. He recruited German artisans and especially farmers from Bavaria and other southern areas as colonists, allowing them privileges such as keeping their language and religion in their settlements. Farmers brought their families and belongings on rafts down the [[Danube River]], and were encouraged to restore farming in the area. They cleared the marshes near the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]] rivers, helped build roads and canals, and re-established agriculture. Trade was also encouraged.<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Banat}}</ref>\n\n[[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] also took a direct interest in the Banat; she colonized the region with large numbers of [[ethnic German|German]] farmers, who were admired for their agricultural skills. She encouraged the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, and generally developed the measures that were introduced by Count Mercy.<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> German settlers arrived from [[Swabia]], [[Alsace]] and [[Bavaria]], as did German-speaking colonists from Austria. Many settlements in the eastern Banat were developed by Germans and had ethnic-German majorities. The ethnic Germans in the Banat region became known as the [[Danube Swabians]], or ''Donauschwaben''. After years of separation from their original German provinces, their language was markedly different, preserving historic characteristics.\n\nSimilarly, a minority coming from French-speaking or linguistically mixed communes in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] maintained the French language for several generations, and developed a specific ethnic identity, later known as Banat French, ''Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''.<ref>[http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&id=1641&l=fr Smaranda Vultur, ''De l\u2019Ouest \u00e0 l\u2019Est et de l\u2019Est \u00e0 l\u2019Ouest : les avatars identitaires des Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''], Texte present\u00e9 a la conf\u00e9rence d'histoire orale: ''Visibles mais pas nombreuses : les circulations migratoires roumaines'', Paris, 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1779, the Banat region was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]], and the three counties of [[Toront\u00e1l|Torontal]], [[Temes County|Temes]] and [[Krass\u00f3|Karasch]] were created. In 1848, after the [[May Assembly]], the western Banat became part of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian autonomous region within the Habsburg Monarchy. During the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions of 1848\u20131849]], the Banat was respectively held by [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] troops.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1848\u20131849, the Banat (together with [[Syrmia]] and [[Ba\u010dka]]) was designated as a separate [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]]. In 1860 this province was abolished and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe Serbian Banat (Western Banat) was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) and part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]] (1849\u20131860). After 1860, later Serbian Banat was part of [[Toront\u00e1l|Torontal]] and Temes counties of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]].

However, it was short-lived. After just two weeks, [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] troops invaded the region and took control. From November 1918 to March 1919, western and central parts of Banat were governed by Serbian administration from [[Novi Sad]], as part of the [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] province of the Kingdom of Serbia and newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was later renamed as [[Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn the wake of the Declaration of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] on December 1, 1918 and the Declaration of Unification of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja with Serbia on November 25, 1918, most of the Banat was (in 1919) divided between Romania ([[Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny]] completely, two-thirds of Temes, and a small part of [[Toront\u00e1l]]) and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (most of [[Toront\u00e1l]], and one-third of Temes).

In 1956, the southern half of the existing Arad Region was incorporated to the Timi\u0219oara Region. In December 1960, the Timi\u0219oara Region was renamed the Banat Region.\n\nOn 17 February 1968, a new territorial division was made and today's Timi\u0219, [[Cara\u0219-Severin County|Cara\u0219-Severin]] and [[Arad County|Arad]] counties were formed.\n\nSince 1998, Romania has been divided into eight [[Development regions of Romania|development regions]], acting as divisions that coordinate and implement regional development. The [[Vest (development region)|Vest development region]] is composed of four counties: Arad, Timi\u0219, Hunedoara and Cara\u0219-Severin; thus it has almost same borders as the Timi\u0219 Province (''\u021binutul Timi\u0219'') of 1938. The Vest development region is also a part of the [[Danube-Kris-Mures-Tisza|Danube-Cri\u0219-Mure\u0219-Tisa]] [[Euroregion]].\n\nEthnic minorities in the region include Hungarians (5.6% of the population), Serbs, Croats (Krashovans), Bulgarians, Ukrainians, and others.\n\n=== Serbian Banat since the First World War ===\n[[Image:Jabuka 2006 002.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jabuka]], built 100 years ago]]\n{{Main|Belgrade Oblast|Danube Banovina|Banat (1941-1944)}}\n[[File:Vojvodina 1922 1929.png|thumb|Banat between 1922 and 1929]]\n[[File:Serbia1941 1944.png|thumb|270px|Serbia and Banat under Nazi occupation 1941-1944]]\n[[File:Vojvodina map02.png|thumb|270px|Serbian Banat within [[Vojvodina]]]]\n\nThe region was county of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] between 1918 and 1922 (in 1918\u20131919, county was part of the province of [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]]) and from 1922 to 1929 it was divided between Belgrade oblast and [[Podunavlje]] oblast. In 1929, most of the region was incorporated into the [[Danube Banovina]] (Danubian Banat), a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], while the city of [[Pan\u010devo]] was incorporated into self-governed Belgrade district.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1944, the [[Banat (1941\u20131944)|Serbian Banat]] was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] troops. Following the Axis partition of Yugoslavia, Serbian Banat was made a part of [[History of Serbia|German-occupied Serbia]], in which it enjoyed autonomy. It functioned as a virtually separate autonomous entity ruled by its German minority, who were promoted by the German occupational military authorities. During this time, numerous war crimes were committed against local Serb and Jewish population. As a consequence of a disturbed ethnic relations during the occupation, much of the local Germans fled from the region together with defeated German army in 1944. Those Germans who remained in the country were sent to prison camps run by the new communist authorities. After prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Serbia because of economic reasons. Many went to Germany; others emigrated to western Europe and the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the Axis Powers occupied this area and partitioned it. Nazi Germany had been intent on expanding into eastern Europe to incorporate what it called the ''[[Volksdeutsche]],'' people of ethnic German descent. They established the political entity known as Banat in 1941. It included only the western part of the historical Banat region, which was formerly part of Yugoslavia. It was formally under the control of the Serbian puppet Government of National Salvation in Belgrade led by [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]. It theoretically had limited jurisdiction over all of the territory under German Military Administration in Serbia, but in practice the local minority of ethnic Germans ([[Danube Swabian]]s or [[Shwoveh]]) held the political power within the Banat. The regional civilian commissioner was Josef Lapp. The head of the ethnic German group was [[Sepp Janko]]. Following the ousting of Axis forces in 1944, this German-ruled region was dissolved. Most of its territory was included in the Vojvodina, one of the two autonomous provinces of Serbia within the new SFR Yugoslavia. Following WWII, most [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|ethnic Germans were expelled]] from the Banat and eastern Europe.\n\nSince 1944\u20131945, the Serbian Banat (together with Ba\u010dka and [[Syrmia]]), has been part of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbian]] [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945\u20131963)|Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]], first as part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and then as part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. Since 2006, it has been part of an independent Serbia.\n\nThe [[districts of Serbia]] in Banat are:\n[[North Banat District|North Banat okrug]] (which also includes municipalities of ''[[Ada, Serbia|Ada]], [[Senta]] and [[Kanji\u017ea]]'', which are situated in the region of Ba\u010dka),\n[[Central Banat District|Central Banat okrug]], and\n[[South Banat District|South Banat okrug]].\n\nSerbian Banat also includes the area known as [[Pan\u010deva\u010dki Rit]], which belongs to the Belgrade municipality of [[Palilula Belgrade|Palilula]].\n\n'''See also''': [[Geographical regions in Serbia]]\n\n=== Hungarian Banat since the First World War ===\nThe Hungarian Banat consists of a small northern part of the region, which is part of the [[Csongr\u00e1d (county)|Csongr\u00e1d]] county of Hungary and is made up of 7 villages and the district of [[Szeged]], \u00dajszeged. The Hungarian part of Banat used to be the northernmost region of the [[Toront\u00e1l County]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In addition to the Hungarian population, there is a small minority of Serbs (e.g. in [[Deszk]], [[Sz\u0151reg]]).\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Banatul la 1743.jpg|thumb|270px|Ethnic map of Banat in 1743]]\n[[File:Banatul la 1774.jpg|thumb|270px|Ethnic map of Banat in 1774]]\n[[File:Lancelot - Roumains de Temesvar.jpg|thumb|270px|Romanians in Timi\u0219oara in 1860]]\n[[File:79 Kirchweihfest 1940.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Banat Swabians]] are an ethnic German population, part of the [[Danube Swabians]] in 1940]]\n[[File:IzbisteIMG 0255.jpg|thumb|270px|Serbs in [[Izbi\u0161te]]]]\n[[File:Banat ethnic2002.png|thumb|270px|Ethnic map of Serbian Banat (2002 census)]]\n{{main|Demographic history of Romania|Demographic history of Serbian Banat|Demographic history of Vojvodina}}\n\n=== The whole Banat ===\n\n==== 1660\u20131666 ====\nIn 1660\u20131666, Serbs lived in western (flat) part of the Banat, while Romanians lived in the eastern (mountainous) part.<ref>Dr. Du\u0161an J.

Those who remained in the country were sent to prison camps run by the new communist authorities, where many died from hunger, disease and cold, but many also escaped. After the prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Serbia and Yugoslavia because of economic reasons. Their flight was mainly a consequence of wartime events and Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, but partly also a consequence of the economic situation in the post-war years.

Such provinces existed mainly in South Slavic, Hungarian and Romanian lands. In South Slavic and other regional languages, terms for \"banate\" were: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] - {{lang|sr|\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 / banovina}}, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] - {{lang|hu|b\u00e1ns\u00e1g}}, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] - {{lang|ro|banat}} and [[Latin language|Latin]] - {{lang|la|banatus}}.\n\nAt the time of the medieval Hungarian kingdom, the territory of modern-day Banat appeared in written sources as ''\"Temesk\u00f6z\"'' (first mentioned in 1374).<ref name=\"Neprajz\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Temesk\u00f6z |encyclopedia=MAGYAR N\u00c9PRAJZI LEXIKON (Hungarian Ethnographic Lexicon) |date= |year= |publisher=Akademiai Kiado (1977-1982)|location= |id= |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02115/html/5-535.html}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=December 2015}} The Hungarian name mainly referred to the lowland areas between the Mure\u015f, Tisza and Danube Rivers.<ref name=\"Neprajz\"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Temesk\u00f6z |encyclopedia=Magyar Katolikus Lexikon (Hungarian Catholic Lexicon) |date= |year= |publisher= |location= |id= |url=http://lexikon.katolikus.hu/T/Temesk%C3%B6z.html }}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=December 2015}} Its Ottoman name was ''\"[[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]]\"'' (later ''\"Eyalet of Yanova\"'').

The word \"Banat\" without any other qualification, typically refers to the historical [[Banat of Temeswar]], which acquired this title after the 1718 [[Treaty of Passarowitz]]. The name was also used from 1941 to 1944, during Axis occupation, for the short-lived political entity (see: [[Banat (1941\u201344)]]), which covered only today's Serbian part of the historical Banat.\n\nThe name ''Banat'' is similar in different languages of the region; {{lang-ro|Banat}}, {{lang-sh|Banat}} / {{lang|sh-Cyrl|\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442}} ({{IPA-sh|b\u01cena\u02d0t|pron}}), {{lang-hu|B\u00e1n\u00e1t}} or ''{{lang|hu|B\u00e1ns\u00e1g}}'', {{lang-bg|\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442}}, {{lang-de|Banat}}, {{lang-uk|\u0411\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442}}, {{lang-tr|Banat}}, {{lang-sk|Ban\u00e1t}}, {{lang-cs|Ban\u00e1t}}, {{lang-el|\u0392\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''V\u00e0naton''.

The climate, except in the marshy parts, is generally healthy. [[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[maize]], [[flax]], [[hemp]] and [[tobacco]] are grown in large quantities, and the products of the vineyards are of a good quality. Game is plentiful and the rivers swarm with fish. The mineral wealth is great, including [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron]] and especially [[coal]]. Amongst its numerous mineral springs, the most important are those of Mehadia, with sulphurous waters, which were already known in the Roman period as the Termae Herculis (''[[B\u0103ile Herculane]]''). The present \"Banat Region\" of Romania includes some areas that are mountainous and were not part of the historical Banat or of the Pannonian plain.\n\nIn Serbia, the Banat is mostly plains. [[Wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rye]], [[maize]], [[hemp]] and [[sunflower]] are grown, and mineral wealth consists of [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]]. A popular tourist destination in the Banat is [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]]. There are also several ethnic minorities in the region, including Hungarians (10.21% of the population), Romanians, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Roma people, and others.\n\n== History ==\n{{History of Banat}} \n{{For|earlier events|Prehistory of Transylvania|Prehistory of Romania|Prehistoric Serbia|Prehistoric Hungary}}\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n{{Main|Scordisci|Dacia|Celts|Celts in Transylvania|Roman Empire|Roman Dacia|Ancient history of Transylvania}}\n\nThe first known inhabitants of present-day Banat were the [[Neolithic]] populations. In the 4th century BC, [[Celtic tribes]] settled in this area. Various [[Hallstatt]] and [[La T\u00e8ne]] objects were found in this area. The most important tribes were the [[Scordisci]] and the [[Taurisci]]. The Scordisci, who formed a powerful state even minted their own coins, imitating the Macedonian tetradrachm. The [[Scordisci]] subdued as all the other tribes in the region to the getic ruler [[Burebista]], therefore their region was part of the [[Dacia]]n kingdom under [[Burebista]] in the first century BC, but the balance of power in the area partially changed during the campaigns of [[Augustus]]. At the beginning of the 2nd century A.D., [[Trajan]] led two wars against the Dacians: the campaigns of 101-102, and 105-106. Eventually, the territory of Banat fell under Roman rule. It became an important link between [[Dacia (Roman province)|Dacia]] province and the other parts of the Empire. Roman rule had a significant impact: [[castra]] and guard stations were established and roads and public buildings built. The public bath establishments of Ad Aquas Herculis, modern-day [[B\u0103ile Herculane]] were also established. Some of the important Roman settlements in Banat were: [[Arcidava (castrum)|Arcidava]] (today [[V\u0103r\u0103dia]]), Centum Putea (today [[Surducu Mare]]), Berzobis (today [[Berzovia]]), Tibiscum (today [[Jupa]]), Agnaviae (today [[Z\u0103voi]]), Ad Pannonios (today [[Teregova]]), Praetorium (today [[Mehadia]]), and Dierna (today [[Or\u0219ova]]).\n\nIn 273 A.D. Emperor [[Aurelian]] withdrew the Roman Army from Dacia.

After the death of [[Attila]], the Hunnic empire disintegrated in days. The previously subjected [[Gepids]] formed a new kingdom in the area, only to be defeated 100 years later by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]].\n\nOne governing center of the Avars was formed in the region, which played an important role in the Avar\u2013Byzantine wars. An inscription on one of the vessels from the [[Treasure of S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]] (which origin is disputed) recorded names of two local rulers, [[Butaul]] and [[Buyla]], who bore [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ruling titles of [[\u017eupan]]. The Avar rule over the area lasted until the 9th century, until [[Charlemagne]]'s campaigns. The Banat region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] a few decades later. Archaeological evidence shows the Avars and Gepids lived here until the middle of the 10th century. The Avar rule had  triggered considerable [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] migration to the southern Pannonian plain and to the Balkans.\n\nIn 895, the [[Hungarians]] living in [[Etelk\u00f6z]] entered the Byzantine-Bulgarian war as allies of Byzantium, and defeated the Bulgars. Because of this, the Bulgarians allied with the [[Pecheneg]]s, who attacked the Hungarian settlements. This led to the process of what is known as the Hungarian conquest of the Pannonian basin, referred to by them as \"hometaking\" (''{{lang|hu|honfoglal\u00e1s}}'') in Hungarian. This also resulted in the loss of part of the territories north of the Danube for the [[Bulgarian empire]].\n\nAccording to ''Gesta Hungarorum'' chronicle, a local ruler known as Glad ruled over the Banat and his army was formed by Vlachs, Bulgarians and Cumans<ref name=\"Madgearu 1998, p. 191-207\">Madgearu, Alexandru - Geneza \u0219i evolu\u021bia voievodatului b\u0103n\u0103\u021bean din secolul al X-lea.(Origins and evolution of Banat duchy in the 19th century).

This was halted with the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. [[Stephen I of Hungary|Istv\u00e1n I]] reasserted dominance over the last local leader, [[Ahtum]] (Ajtony in other sources). Ahtum was a semi-independent ruler of Banat and an Orthodox Christian. Ahtum constructed a Byzantine monastery at Morisena. His vassal [[Csan\u00e1d]] defeated him by the will of King Stephen I of Hungary. The territory of the modern Banat did not form a separate territorial unit in medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]], it was an integral part of it. The territory was shared by [[Krass\u00f3 County|Krass\u00f3]], [[Keve County|Keve]], [[Temes County|Temes]], [[Csan\u00e1d County (medieval)|Csan\u00e1d]], [[Arad County (former)|Arad]] and [[Toront\u00e1l County|Toront\u00e1l Counties]].\n\nIn 1233, under the Kingdom of Hungary administration, the [[Banate of Severin]], a military frontier area was formed, including some eastern parts of the modern Banat. In the 14th century, the region became of priority concern to the Kingdom, as the southern border of the Banat was the most important defensive line against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] expansion from the Southeast.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Salan glad01.png|Duchy of [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], 9th century\nFile:Ahtum sermon03 01.png|Duchy of [[Ahtum]], 11th century\nFile:Koh administrative 1370 01.png|Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary in present-day Banat region in the 14th century\nFile:Banate of severin.png|Banate of Severin\n</gallery>\n\n=== Ottoman administration (1552\u20131716) ===\n[[File:After the capture of Temesv\u00e1r, 1552.jpg|thumb|190px|After the capture of Temesv\u00e1r, 1552]]\n{{Main|Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar|Early Modern Romania|Ottoman Serbia}}\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] took over the area and incorporated the Banat in 1552.

Numerous Ottoman Muslims settled in the area, living mostly in the cities and associated with trade and administration.\n\nNot all of the Banat fell immediately under Turkish rule. Eastern regions around [[Lugoj]] and [[Caransebe\u0219]] came under the rule of Princes of Transylvania. In that area, a new banate was formed, known as the [[Banate of Lugoj and Caransebe\u0219]].\n\nIn the spring of 1594, shortly after the beginning of [[Long Turkish War|Austro-Turkish War (1593-1606)]], Serbian Christians{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the nationality of the insurgents|date=November 2016}} in [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]] started an [[Uprising in Banat|Uprising]] against Turkish rule. The local Romanians also participated in this uprising. At first, rebels were successful. They took the city of [[Vr\u0161ac]] and various other towns in Banat and started negotiations with Prince of Transylvania. One of the leaders of the uprising was local Serbian Orthodox Bishop [[Teodor of Vr\u0161ac|Theodore]].{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=141-142}}\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century, the territory of [[Banate of Lugoj and Caransebe\u0219]] finally fell under Turkish rule and was incorporated into [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]].\n\nDuring [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Turkish War (1683-1699)]], local Serbian uprisings broke out in various parts of [[Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]].

His jurisdiction (including the province) was officially recognized by the charters of emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in 1690, 1691 and 1695.

After the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] (1718), the region became a province of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was not incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. Special provincial administration was established, centered in Temesv\u00e1r.\n\nIn 1738, over 50 Romanian villages from Serbia and Banat were destroyed and dwellers murdered by Austrians and Serb militia during a revolt of Romanians.<ref>Picot, Emile, Les serbes de Hongrie, leur histoire, leurs privileges, leur \u00e9glise, leur \u00e9tat politique et social.

It remained a separate province within the Habsburg Monarchy and under military administration until 1751, when Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] reorganized the province, dividing it between military and civil administration. The Banat of Temeswar province was abolished in 1778, when civilian part of the region was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary and divided into counties. The southern part of the Banat region remained within the [[Military Frontier]] ([[Banat Krajina]]) until the Frontier was abolished in 1871.\n\nDuring the Ottoman rule, parts of Banat had a low population density due to years of warfare, and some local residents also lost their lives during Habsburg-Ottoman wars and Prince Eugene of Savoy's conquest. Much of the area had reverted to nearly uninhabited marsh, heath and forest. Count [[Claudius Mercy]] (1666\u20131734), who was appointed governor of the Banat of Temeswar in 1720, took numerous measures for the regeneration of the Banat. He recruited German artisans and especially farmers from Bavaria and other southern areas as colonists, allowing them privileges such as keeping their language and religion in their settlements. Farmers brought their families and belongings on rafts down the [[Danube River]], and were encouraged to restore farming in the area. They cleared the marshes near the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Tisa]] rivers, helped build roads and canals, and re-established agriculture. Trade was also encouraged.<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Banat}}</ref>\n\n[[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] also took a direct interest in the Banat; she colonized the region with large numbers of [[ethnic German|German]] farmers, who were admired for their agricultural skills. She encouraged the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country, and generally developed the measures that were introduced by Count Mercy.<ref name=\"eb1911\" /> German settlers arrived from [[Swabia]], [[Alsace]] and [[Bavaria]], as did German-speaking colonists from Austria. Many settlements in the eastern Banat were developed by Germans and had ethnic-German majorities. The ethnic Germans in the Banat region became known as the [[Danube Swabians]], or ''Donauschwaben''. After years of separation from their original German provinces, their language was markedly different, preserving historic characteristics.\n\nSimilarly, a minority coming from French-speaking or linguistically mixed communes in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] maintained the French language for several generations, and developed a specific ethnic identity, later known as Banat French, ''Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''.<ref>[http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&id=1641&l=fr Smaranda Vultur, ''De l\u2019Ouest \u00e0 l\u2019Est et de l\u2019Est \u00e0 l\u2019Ouest : les avatars identitaires des Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''], Texte present\u00e9 a la conf\u00e9rence d'histoire orale: ''Visibles mais pas nombreuses : les circulations migratoires roumaines'', Paris, 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1779, the Banat region was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]], and the three counties of [[Toront\u00e1l|Torontal]], [[Temes County|Temes]] and [[Krass\u00f3|Karasch]] were created. In 1848, after the [[May Assembly]], the western Banat became part of the [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian autonomous region within the Habsburg Monarchy. During the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions of 1848\u20131849]], the Banat was respectively held by [[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] troops.\n\nAfter the Revolution of 1848\u20131849, the Banat (together with [[Syrmia]] and [[Ba\u010dka]]) was designated as a separate [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]]. In 1860 this province was abolished and most of its territory was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe Serbian Banat (Western Banat) was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]] (1848\u20131849) and part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]] (1849\u20131860). After 1860, later Serbian Banat was part of [[Toront\u00e1l|Torontal]] and Temes counties of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]].

However, it was short-lived. After just two weeks, [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] troops invaded the region and took control. From November 1918 to March 1919, western and central parts of Banat were governed by Serbian administration from [[Novi Sad]], as part of the [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] province of the Kingdom of Serbia and newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was later renamed as [[Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn the wake of the Declaration of [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]] on December 1, 1918 and the Declaration of Unification of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja with Serbia on November 25, 1918, most of the Banat was (in 1919) divided between Romania ([[Krass\u00f3-Sz\u00f6r\u00e9ny]] completely, two-thirds of Temes, and a small part of [[Toront\u00e1l]]) and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (most of [[Toront\u00e1l]], and one-third of Temes).

In 1929, most of the region was incorporated into the [[Danube Banovina]] (Danubian Banat), a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], while the city of [[Pan\u010devo]] was incorporated into self-governed Belgrade district.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1944, the [[Banat (1941\u20131944)|Serbian Banat]] was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] troops. Following the Axis partition of Yugoslavia, Serbian Banat was made a part of [[History of Serbia|German-occupied Serbia]], in which it enjoyed autonomy. It functioned as a virtually separate autonomous entity ruled by its German minority, who were promoted by the German occupational military authorities. During this time, numerous war crimes were committed against local Serb and Jewish population. As a consequence of a disturbed ethnic relations during the occupation, much of the local Germans fled from the region together with defeated German army in 1944. Those Germans who remained in the country were sent to prison camps run by the new communist authorities. After prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Serbia because of economic reasons. Many went to Germany; others emigrated to western Europe and the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the Axis Powers occupied this area and partitioned it. Nazi Germany had been intent on expanding into eastern Europe to incorporate what it called the ''[[Volksdeutsche]],'' people of ethnic German descent. They established the political entity known as Banat in 1941. It included only the western part of the historical Banat region, which was formerly part of Yugoslavia. It was formally under the control of the Serbian puppet Government of National Salvation in Belgrade led by [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]. It theoretically had limited jurisdiction over all of the territory under German Military Administration in Serbia, but in practice the local minority of ethnic Germans ([[Danube Swabian]]s or [[Shwoveh]]) held the political power within the Banat. The regional civilian commissioner was Josef Lapp. The head of the ethnic German group was [[Sepp Janko]]. Following the ousting of Axis forces in 1944, this German-ruled region was dissolved. Most of its territory was included in the Vojvodina, one of the two autonomous provinces of Serbia within the new SFR Yugoslavia. Following WWII, most [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|ethnic Germans were expelled]] from the Banat and eastern Europe.\n\nSince 1944-1945, the Serbian Banat (together with Ba\u010dka and [[Syrmia]]), has been part of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbian]] [[Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (1945\u20131963)|Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]], first as part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and then as part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro]].

In Serbia the majority of the Banat Swabian or Shwovish population fled from the region together with the defeated German army in the Fall of 1944, as one can see in the population Table below, where the German - speaking Shwovish population dropped from about 120,000 in 1931 to about 17,000 in 1948. Those who remained in the country were sent to prison camps run by the new communist authorities, where many died from hunger, disease and cold, but many also escaped. After the prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Serbia and Yugoslavia because of economic reasons. Their flight was mainly a consequence of wartime events and Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, but partly also a consequence of the economic situation in the post-war years. In Romania ethnic Germans mostly emigrated after 1989 for economic reasons.\n\n==== Population table ====\nThe historical population of the Banat region in different time periods:\n\n{|
