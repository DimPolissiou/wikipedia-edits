Their main colony ship, the ''Resolute'', is attacked by aliens, forcing the colonists to escape in their smaller ''Jupiter'' spacecrafts, but are hurled into a [[wormhole]] and crash-land on an Earth-like planet. The Robinsons' ship, the ''Jupiter 2'', crashes into a glacial bed. The family evacuates as their ship sinks in rapidly freezing water. Eldest Robinson child Judy, a teenaged doctor, becomes trapped in the ice while diving to the sunken ship for equipment. John and son Will set out to collect magnesium to melt the ice before Judy's oxygen runs out. While trapped, Judy guides her sister, Penny, through a medical procedure to treat their injured mother, Maureen. Inside a cave, Will falls into a chasm, landing near a forest. Will finds a crashed alien ship and a dismembered robot he helps to self-repair. In return, it saves Will from a forest fire. Will and the robot return to the Robinson base camp, and the robot rescues Judy. Twelve hours earlier, a woman is shown stealing Dr. Zachary Smith's identity and boarding an escaping ''Jupiter'' craft along with Don West, a ''Resolute'' crew member and occasional smuggler, and another co-worker, Tam Roughneck.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Diamonds in the Sky\n |DirectedBy      = Neil Marshall\n |WrittenBy       = Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|04|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = Don West and Smith survive the ''Jupiter 18'' crash landing.

In an ensuing altercation, he is blown out an airlock. June is arrested but escapes during the robot's attack. In the present, they are trillions of miles off course. At night, the refreezing ice layer over ''Jupiter 2'' cracks, endangering the ship. While rushing to complete repairs, the group discovers large eel-like creatures in the conduits consuming fuel. The glacier shifts, forcing an emergency take-off after the eels are flushed from the engines. There is enough fuel to take off and land near a forest.

Don, along with Victor Dhar, Judy, and other colonists set out to retrieve the fuel in Don's ''Jupiter''. It crashed in the desert where there are no eel-like creatures. While inside the crashed ship, Don retrieves the real Dr. Smith's identification, later showing Judy. Maureen learns that Hiroki also knows the planet is dying. Penny tells Vijay about the black hole but swears him to secrecy, then they share a kiss.

En route to another Jupiter, John and Maureen's chariot rover gets stuck in a tar pit and sinks. Before escaping, Maureen admits she falsified Will's test results to colonist qualification as he failed the stress test. Meanwhile, Smith locates the destroyed robot, but is unable to get it to reassemble itself. While Don's group speeds through a geyser field with the recovered fuel, the tanker flips, and Evan becomes trapped underneath. Moving the tanker to save Evan will cause most of the fuel to be lost. It is decided to move the tanker, losing fuel, but Evan dies on the way back. Back on ''Jupiter 2'', Dr. Smith finds the alien signal triggering a [[booting]] response, and finally reactivates the robot.

Maureen devises a launch plan by piloting the Jupiters like the [[Apollo program]], with John and Don as pilots. Judy informs Maureen about the real Dr. Smith, so Maureen confines the fake Smith as she then claims to really be physicist Jessica Harris. Removing life support to trim extra weight, the ''Resolute'' signals they must leave orbit within 24 hours due to the approaching [[Hawking radiation]]. This news forces John and Don to launch in the ''Jupiter 4'' ahead of schedule in the evening.

Dr. Smith promises to help Maureen get her children off the planet in exchange for Maureen helping her with the alien ship. Will discovers that the cave rocks he collected are petrified biomass and can fuel the ''Jupiter'' ships to reach the ''Resolute''. While colonists harvest the biomass, Judy searches for Maureen. The colonists gather enough biomass to power all the ''Jupiters'' but they must remove it quietly to avoid waking the dangerous winged predators roosting in the cave. Will detects a signal he believes is from John. Periodic flashbacks reveal the Christmas Star was not a meteor but an alien craft. Its engine was used to build ''Resolute''. The robot's attack was an attempt to retrieve the stolen engine. The group narrowly escape the cave after awakening the creatures. Judy tracks down Smith and Maureen.

The Robot now under Smith's control rejects Will's attempt to re-bond, but Smith allows Maureen's rescue attempt of John in the ''Jupiter 2''. Victor hails the Robinsons, saying all colonists on the ''Resolute'' must leave in one hour to avoid the radiation. Maureen traps Dr. Smith and the robot, but they escape shortly thereafter. After Maureen lures the robot into the cargo bay and knocks him into space, a second alien robot (SAR) arrives to retrieve its engine. As SAR is about to kill Will, his Robot remembers their friendship and saves Will, hurtling both it and SAR robots into space. Will goes outside to manually close the damaged open hatch, but losing his grip he is saved by John, rescued by Smith shooting a harpoon. With all Robinsons safely aboard ''Jupiter 2'', Maureen confines Dr. Smith, grateful but still distrusting. Before they can dock with ''Resolute'', the alien engine activates and catapults ''Jupiter 2'' to a different solar system.

When a breach in the make-shift hothouse destroys the food crop, the family must leave the planet. To recharge the ship's battery, tall sails are erected on the Jupiter's hull to navigate the ship toward a potential electrical storm. Mid-voyage, they hit a reef while attempting to outrun a monsoon, during which John is injured. Maureen is forced to release the imprisoned Dr. Smith who, claiming she knows how to sail, successfully helms the Jupiter through a narrow reef passage. Smith later tells Maureen that she deliberately breached the hothouse to destroy the crops, knowing Maureen wanted to leave the planet while John was content staying there.

Their main colony ship, the ''Resolute'', is attacked by aliens, forcing the colonists to escape in their smaller ''Jupiter'' spacecrafts, but are hurled into a [[wormhole]] and crash-land on an Earth-like planet. The Robinsons' ship, the ''Jupiter 2'', crashes into a glacial bed. The family evacuates as their ship sinks in rapidly freezing water. Eldest Robinson child Judy, a teenaged doctor, becomes trapped in the ice while diving to the sunken ship for equipment. John and son Will set out to collect magnesium to melt the ice before Judy's oxygen runs out. While trapped, Judy guides her sister, Penny, through a medical procedure to treat their injured mother, Maureen. Inside a cave, Will falls into a chasm, landing near a forest. Will finds a crashed alien ship and a dismembered robot he helps to self-repair. In return, it saves Will from a forest fire. Will and the robot return to the Robinson base camp, and the robot rescues Judy. Twelve hours earlier, a woman is shown stealing Dr. Zachary Smith's identity and boarding an escaping ''Jupiter'' craft along with Don West, a ''Resolute'' crew member and occasional smuggler, and another co-worker, Tam Roughneck.\n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Diamonds in the Sky\n |DirectedBy      = Neil Marshall\n |WrittenBy       = Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|04|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = Don West and Smith survive the ''Jupiter 18'' crash landing.

Meanwhile, the robot melts more ice to allow the ''Jupiter 2'' to be recovered. Penny and Judy continue raising the sunken ship while Maureen, John, Will, and the robot hike to another Jupiter crash site they have spotted. They also inspect the robot's wrecked ship. Inside, a holographic map shows they are stranded in an unidentified galaxy. Outside, the robot touches the ship's hull, creating a mental connection to Will who \"sees\" what actually happened aboard the ''Resolute'': the attackers were robots like his, who was also there. When Penny detects a storm approaching, she accelerates raising the ''Jupiter 2'' to access the ship's ''Chariot'' all-terrain vehicle. She rescues the family ahead of the storm.

In an ensuing altercation, he is blown out an airlock. June is arrested but escapes during the robot's attack. In the present, they are trillions of miles off course. At night, the refreezing ice layer over ''Jupiter 2'' cracks, endangering the ship. While rushing to complete repairs, the group discovers large eel-like creatures in the conduits consuming fuel. The glacier shifts, forcing an emergency take-off after the eels are flushed from the engines. There is enough fuel to take off and land near a forest.

The fuel-consuming eels prevent the other Jupiters from taking off. The transmitting communication dish has also been damaged, leaving the colonists unable to contact the ''Resolute''. While Maureen and John go on a short mission, Judy confronts Will about the robot attack on the ''Resolute''. They hide the robot in a nearby cave, unaware Smith has followed them. They run into Vijay Dhar, son of Victor Dhar, a colonist leader. The next morning, the children return to ''Jupiter 2'' before their parents' arrival.

He then takes Will on a hike to discuss his responsibility for the robot's actions and has Will build a stone memorial to the 27 casualties. Don, along with Victor Dhar, Judy, and other colonists set out to retrieve the fuel in Don's ''Jupiter''. It crashed in the desert where there are no eel-like creatures. While inside the crashed ship, Don retrieves the real Dr. Smith's identification, later showing Judy. Maureen learns that Hiroki also knows the planet is dying. Penny tells Vijay about the black hole but swears him to secrecy, then they share a kiss.

En route to another Jupiter, John and Maureen's chariot rover gets stuck in a tar pit and sinks. Before escaping, Maureen admits she falsified Will's test results to colonist qualification as he failed the stress test. Meanwhile, Smith locates the destroyed robot, but is unable to get it to reassemble itself. While Don's group speeds through a geyser field with the recovered fuel, the tanker flips, and Evan becomes trapped underneath. Moving the tanker to save Evan will cause most of the fuel to be lost. It is decided to move the tanker, losing fuel, but Evan dies on the way back. Back on ''Jupiter 2'', Dr. Smith finds the alien signal triggering a [[booting]] response, and finally reactivates the robot.

Later, the gathered colonists are told the planet is becoming uninhabitable; Penny breaks up with Vijay learning he told his father about the black hole. Maureen devises a launch plan by piloting the Jupiters like the [[Apollo program]], with John and Don as pilots. Judy informs Maureen about the real Dr. Smith, so Maureen confines the fake Smith as she then claims to really be physicist Jessica Harris. Removing life support to trim extra weight, the ''Resolute'' signals they must leave orbit within 24 hours due to the approaching [[Hawking radiation]]. This news forces John and Don to launch in the ''Jupiter 4'' ahead of schedule in the evening.

Dr. Smith drives a captive Maureen to the alien wreck. She claims she did not know that Maureen was guiding the ship launch. Dr. Smith promises to help Maureen get her children off the planet in exchange for Maureen helping her with the alien ship. Will discovers that the cave rocks he collected are petrified biomass and can fuel the ''Jupiter'' ships to reach the ''Resolute''. While colonists harvest the biomass, Judy searches for Maureen. The colonists gather enough biomass to power all the ''Jupiters'' but they must remove it quietly to avoid waking the dangerous winged predators roosting in the cave. Will detects a signal he believes is from John. Periodic flashbacks reveal the Christmas Star was not a meteor but an alien craft. Its engine was used to build ''Resolute''. The robot's attack was an attempt to retrieve the stolen engine. The group narrowly escape the cave after awakening the creatures. Judy tracks down Smith and Maureen.

The Robot now under Smith's control rejects Will's attempt to re-bond, but Smith allows Maureen's rescue attempt of John in the ''Jupiter 2''. Victor hails the Robinsons, saying all colonists on the ''Resolute'' must leave in one hour to avoid the radiation. Maureen traps Dr. Smith and the robot, but they escape shortly thereafter. After Maureen lures the robot into the cargo bay and knocks him into space, a second alien robot (SAR) arrives to retrieve its engine. As SAR is about to kill Will, his Robot remembers their friendship and saves Will, hurtling both it and SAR robots into space. Will goes outside to manually close the damaged open hatch, but losing his grip he is saved by John, rescued by Smith shooting a harpoon. With all Robinsons safely aboard ''Jupiter 2'', Maureen confines Dr. Smith, grateful but still distrusting. Before they can dock with ''Resolute'', the alien engine activates and catapults ''Jupiter 2'' to a different solar system.

When a breach in the make-shift hothouse destroys the food crop, the family must leave the planet. To recharge the ship's battery, tall sails are erected on the Jupiter's hull to navigate the ship toward a potential electrical storm. Mid-voyage, they hit a reef while attempting to outrun a monsoon, during which John is injured. Maureen is forced to release the imprisoned Dr. Smith who, claiming she knows how to sail, successfully helms the Jupiter through a narrow reef passage. Smith later tells Maureen that she deliberately breached the hothouse to destroy the crops, knowing Maureen wanted to leave the planet while John was content staying there.

A parasitic spore that destroys metal causes the drilling rig over a deep well to collapse, trapping John below. All traffic to the Resolute is halted to prevent the parasite's spread. As Commander Radic interrogates Smith, she infects him with the toxic kelp, putting him in a coma. With Radic incapacitated and a falsified identity, Smith now has a \"clean slate.\" Penny is the only person on board who knows the truth, but must prove it. Will tries bonding with Scarecrow, giving it SAR's detached arm to repair itself. Distrusting any human, it attempts to attack him.

Smith has learned that once Maureen and Will return with the Robot, the Resolute, having a limited water supply, will depart for Alpha Centauri with only those currently on board. The remaining colonists will be left on the planet. Adler intends to use the Robot to pilot the alien engine the same as Scarecrow, which was chained and tortured into compliance. Adler observes the Robot's emotional empathy for living things. After the Robot removes the alien engine from Jupiter 2, John updates Maureen about Hastings' true intent.

If Maureen refuses to surrender the bridge, Hastings threatens to open an airlock where crew are working. John sends Smith to warn Maureen, but Smith detours to avoid confronting Samantha and her mother, taking her longer to reach the bridge and arriving too late to gain access. Hastings opens the airlock, trapping Ava and Don, who are barely surviving using air masks. Maureen saves Don and Ava, using a service pod to close the airlock from the outside. The mutiny fails, but Captain Kamal trusts Maureen's calculations and utilizes her plan over Hastings' objections. Meanwhile, Penny tells Will that the Robot appears changed, which seems proven when it ignores Will's pleas to help the trapped workers and instead frees Scarecrow.

Will agrees to help the Robot save the dying Scarecrow by returning it to the planet, assisted by Judy and Penny. Meanwhile, Smith aids Hastings in foiling their attempt. By playing a [[shell game]], the Robinson children deceive the authorities and Will is able to get Scarecrow to ''Jupiter 2'', only to be stopped by Adler. Will convinces a remorseful Adler to help transport Scarecrow to the planet, but the Robot is captured to allow them escape.

A ship of robots attacks and boards the ''Resolute'' to retrieve the alien engine. Maureen and Don trap the robots, while Judy captains a mission to send the Resolute's ninety-seven children to the Alpha Centauri colony in a Jupiter using the alien engine, piloted by the Robot. Unable to travel through the space rift, the Resolute crew and the adult colonists scatter in the other Jupiters. Smith and Scarecrow both sacrifice themselves battling the invading robots, giving Judy, Will, Penny, and the children time to escape. Maureen and John stay behind to destroy the ''Resolute'' and the robots' ship. Don rescues them in ''Jupiter 2'' before the ship explodes. The \"Jupiter Transport\" carrying the children escapes through the rift. However, the human-made radar signature that the Robot followed has led the ship to an unknown star system. They suddenly see the ''Fortuna'', a ship that vanished nearly twenty years earlier and was commanded by Grant Kelly, Judy's biological father.\n |LineColor       = 4BA3BB\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn October 2014, it was announced that [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Television]] and Synthesis Entertainment were developing a new reboot of ''[[Lost in Space]]'' and had hired screenwriting duo [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]] to pen the pilot episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/lost-in-space-reboot-dracula-writers-legendary-tv-848901/ |title=''Lost In Space'' Series Reboot In Works At Legendary TV With ''Dracula'' Writers |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=October 9, 2014 |accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref> In November 2015, [[Netflix]] landed the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/lost-in-space-tv-series-remake-netflix-1201587644/ |title=''Lost In Space'' TV Series Remake In Works At Netflix |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbr.com/lost-in-space-remake-in-development-at-netflix/ |title=''Lost in Space'' Remake in Development at Netflix |last1=White |first1=Brett |last2=Ching |first2=Albert |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 20, 2015 |accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref> On June 29, 2016, Netflix ordered a full 10 episode season of ''Lost in Space'', with [[Zack Estrin]] as executive producer and [[showrunner]].

Kennedy Airport]], 7 February 1964}}\n\n'''Beatlemania''' was the intense [[fan (person)|fan frenzy]] surrounding the English rock band [[the Beatles]] in the 1960s. The group's popularity grew in the United Kingdom throughout 1963, propelled by the singles \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", \"[[From Me to You]]\" and \"[[She Loves You]]\". By October, the press adopted the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the scenes of adulation that attended the band's concert performances. From the start of 1964, their world tours were characterised by the same levels of hysteria and high-pitched screaming by female fans, both at concerts and during the group's travels. Commentators likened the intensity of this adulation to a religious fervour and to a female masturbation fantasy. Among the displays of [[deity]]-like worship, fans would approach the band in the belief that they possessed supernatural healing powers.\n\nIn February 1964, the Beatles arrived in the United States and their televised performances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' were viewed by approximately 73 million people. There, the band's instant popularity established their international stature, and their unprecedented domination of the national sales charts was similarly repeated in numerous other countries. Their August 1965 concert at New York's [[Shea Stadium]] marked the first time that a large outdoor stadium was used for such a purpose, and with an audience of 55,000, set records for attendance and revenue generation. To protect them from their fans, the Beatles typically travelled to these concerts by armoured car. From the end of that year, the band embraced promo clips for their singles to avoid the difficulties of making personal appearances on television programmes. Their December 1965 album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' marked a profound change in the dynamic between fans and artist, as many Beatles fans sought to appreciate the progressive quality in the band's look, lyrics and sound.\n\nIn 1966, [[John Lennon]] controversially remarked that the group had become \"[[more popular than Jesus]]\". Soon afterwards, when the Beatles [[The Beatles' 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines|toured Japan, the Philippines and the US]], they were entangled in mob revolt, violence, political backlash and threats of assassination. Frustrated by the restrictions of Beatlemania and unable to hear themselves play above their fans' screams, the group stopped touring and became a studio-only band. The success of their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' defied commentators' speculation that abandoning live performances would lead to a decline in popularity. The last mass display of Beatlemania took place in July 1968 at the world premiere of the animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''.  \n\nBeatlemania surpassed any previous examples of fan worship In its intensity and scope. Initially, the fans were predominately young adolescent females, sometimes called \"[[teenybopper]]s\", and their behaviour was scorned by many commentators, particularly conservatives. By 1965, their fanbase included listeners who traditionally shunned youth-driven pop culture, which helped bridge divisions between [[folk music|folk]] and rock enthusiasts. During the 1960s, Beatlemania was the subject of analysis by [[Psychology|psychologists]] and [[Sociology|sociologists]]; a 1997 study recognised the phenomenon as an early demonstration of proto-[[Feminism|feminist]] [[girl power]]. The receptions of subsequent pop acts \u2013 particularly [[boy band]]s \u2013 have drawn comparisons to Beatlemania, although none have replicated the breadth and depth of the Beatles' [[fandom]] nor its cultural impact.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Interpretations and precursors==\n[[File:Aankomst Beatles op Schiphol, overzicht drukte op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 916-5134.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Members of the media swarm the Beatles at Amsterdam's [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]] in June 1964, as fans await them on top of the airport terminal.|alt=]]\n\nFrom 1963, [[the Beatles]] provided one of the first opportunities for female teenagers in Britain to exhibit spending power and publicly express sexual desire, while the group's image suggested a disregard for adults' opinions and parents' ideas of morality.{{sfn|Simonelli|2013|pp=19, 22\u201323}} In the description of author and musician [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]], the band's domestic breakthrough represented a \"final liberation\" for the nation's teenagers and, by coinciding with the end of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], the group \"effectively signaled the end of World War II in Britain\".{{sfn|Stanley|2014|p=85}}\n\nDuring the 1840s, fans of Hungarian pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] showed a level of fanaticism similar to that of the Beatles. Poet [[Heinrich Heine]] coined \"[[Lisztomania]]\" to describe this.<ref name=\"Lynskey/Observer\" /> Once it became an international phenomenon in 1964, Beatlemania surpassed in intensity and reach any previous examples of fan worship, including those afforded [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref name=\"Ehrenreich/Hess/Jacobs\" /> One factor in this development may have been the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom]], which gave the Beatles a larger audience of young fans than Sinatra and Presley had a decade earlier.<ref name=\"Lynskey/Observer\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/29/beatlemania-screamers-fandom-teenagers-hysteria |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |department=The Observer |first=Dorian |last=Lynskey |title=Beatlemania: 'the screamers' and other tales of fandom |date=28 September 2013 |access-date=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nPsychologists during the 1960s were especially drawn to the significance of the long hair preferred by the Beatles and the bands that emerged soon after their breakthrough. Academics proposed that the long hair signalled androgyny and thus presented a less threatening version of male sexuality to teenage girls, as well as allowing male fans to view the group in a sexual regard that they normally reserved for young females. Other concerns related to the Beatles' own sexuality; whether the haircuts were a projection of latent homosexuality or confident heterosexuality.{{sfn|Doggett|2015|p=323}} In their 1986 book ''Re-making Love: The Feminization of Sex'', authors [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], Elizabeth Hess and Gloria Jacobs argued that the band's presentable suits meant that they seemed less \"sleazy\" than Presley to middle-class whites.<ref name=\"Ehrenreich/Hess/Jacobs\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-12-14/features/8604030230_1_young-women-riot-beatles/4 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |last=Ehrenreich |first=Barbara |last2=Hess |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Jacobs |first3=Gloria |date=14 December 1986 |title=Screams Heard 'Round the World |access-date=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1964, [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote an article in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' which stated that the mania was a modern incarnation of [[female hysteria]] and that the wild fans at the Beatles' concerts were \"the least fortunate of their generation, the dull, the idle, the failures\".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|title=The Menace of Beatlism|first=Paul|last=Johnson|date=28 February 1964}}</ref> The article became the \"most complained-about piece\" in the magazine's history.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/08/archive-menace-beatlism|date=2014|title=From the archive: The Menace of Beatlism}}</ref> A 1966 study published in the ''[[British Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' rejected Johnson's assertion; the researchers found that Beatles fans were not likelier to score higher on [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]'s hysteria scale, nor were they unusually neurotic.

Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] says that some who attended the band's 27 December 1960 show in [[Litherland]] claim that Beatlemania was \"born\" there, while [[Bob Wooler]], who regularly presented the Beatles at Liverpool's [[The Cavern Club|Cavern Club]], wrote in August 1961 that they were \"the stuff that screams are made of\" and were already playing to \"fever-pitch audiences\" at the Cavern. However, national recognition of \"Beatlemania\" eluded the band until late 1963.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=46}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles with Birmingham Police officers.jpg|thumb|The Beatles outside the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]], November 1963.

In the UK, the song reached number two on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart (subsequently adopted as the [[UK Singles Chart]]),{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=103}} and topped both the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' charts.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=119\u2013122}} The band released their first album in March 1963, also titled ''[[Please Please Me]]''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=88\u201389}} They completed four nationwide tours and performed at a great many single shows around the UK throughout the year, often finishing one show only to travel straight to the next show in another location \u2013 sometimes even to perform again the same day.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=117\u2013185}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dermon.com/Beatles/details/tours.htm|title=The Beatles on Tour 1963 to 1966|accessdate=30 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506004816/http://www.dermon.com/beatles/details/tours.htm| archivedate= 6 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters, and other Beatle-related articles.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=136\u2013137}} Lennon's August 1962 marriage to [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]] was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=128\u2013129}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon's son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] was born on 8 April 1963.

The band proved immensely popular during the tour, however, as journalist Gordon Sampson observed. His report did not use the word \"Beatlemania\", but the phenomenon was evident. Sampson wrote that \"a great reception went to the colourfully dressed Beatles, who almost stole the show, for the audience repeatedly called for them while other artists were performing!\"{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=124}} The Beatles' second nationwide tour began on 9 March at the Granada Cinema in London, where the group appeared on a bill headed by American stars [[Tommy Roe]] and [[Chris Montez]], both of whom had firmly established themselves in the UK singles charts.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=382}} Throughout the tour, the crowds repeatedly screamed for the Beatles, and the American stars were less popular than a homegrown act for the first time. The Beatles enjoyed the overwhelming enthusiasm, but they also felt embarrassment for the American performers at this unexpected turn of events, which persisted at every show on the tour.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=125\u2013132}}\n\nIn May, the Beatles achieved their first number 1 single on the ''Record Retailer'' chart with \"[[From Me to You]]\".{{sfn|Stanley|2014|p=85}} McCartney later cited the song title, along with that of its B-side, \"[[Thank You Girl]]\", as an example of he and Lennon directly addressing the group's fans and appreciating that such a seemingly personal message resonated with their audience.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=9}} According to Stanley, the band provided a sense of liberation for fans of both sexes, in that: \"The boys could make as much noise as possible; the girls had something with dirt under its fingernails they could scream at.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2014|p=85}}\n\nThe Beatles began their [[Roy Orbison/The Beatles Tour|third nationwide tour]] on 18 May, the bill this time headed by [[Roy Orbison]]. Orbison had established even greater UK chart success than either Montez or Roe, with four hits in the top 10,{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=344}} but he proved less popular than the Beatles at the tour's opening show staged at the Adelphi Cinema, Slough. It soon became obvious that this was not going to change, and a week into the tour the covers of the souvenir programs were reprinted to place the Beatles above Orbison. Starr was nonetheless impressed with the response that Orbison still commanded, saying: \"We would be backstage, listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just doing it by his voice. Just standing there singing, not moving or anything.\"{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=132\u2013133}} The tour lasted three weeks and ended on 9 June.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=132}}\n\n===\"She Loves You\", coinage of \"Beatlemania\" and autumn 1963 UK tour===\n{{listen|type=music\n|title=\"She Loves You\" (1963)\n|filename=She Loves You (Beatles song - sample).ogg\n|description=Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] says that while Beatlemania was \"cooking in the summer of 1963\", the release of \"She Loves You\" \"brought it to the boil\".

Thousands of fans ordered the single as early as June 1963, well before its title had been known.{{sfn|Davies|1968|p=202}} In July, the band convened at EMI Studios for the song's recording session, an occasion that was publicised in advance by the weekly pop papers.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=115}} More than a hundred fans congregated outside the studio, and dozens broke through a police barricade, swarming the studio in search of the band.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2005}} By the day before the single went on sale, some 500,000 advanced orders had been placed for it.{{sfn|Davies|1968|p=202}}  \"She Loves You\" ultimately topped record charts upon its release in August, and set several British sales records.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=35}} The song included a \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" refrain that became a signature hook for their European audiences; in addition, the song's [[falsetto]] \"Ooh!\"s elicited further fan delirium when accompanied by the vocalists' exaggerated shaking of their moptop hair.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=75}} \n\nOn 13 October, the Beatles starred on [[Val Parnell]]'s ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'', the UK's top variety show.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=146}} Their performance was televised live and watched by 15&nbsp;million viewers.

The reaction from female fans varied; one found the cover \"very sensual ... they looked grown up and sexy\", while another described it as \"scary, difficult, unpleasant\", adding: \"They looked menacing, like they were looking down on a victim. They looked like wooly mammoths, brown and leathery.\"{{sfn|Leonard|2014|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nIn the UK, the release was accompanied by speculation that the group's success would soon end, given that most acts there faded after two or three years at the top.{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=16\u201317}} The Beatles had also defied convention and Epstein's wishes by drastically reducing their concert schedule in 1965,{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=141}} and they disappointed fans by refusing to reprise their annual ''Christmas Show'' season.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=335}} During the band's [[The Beatles' 1965 UK tour|UK tour]] that December, some newspapers reported that the intensity of the fans' passion appeared to have diminished.

The authors add: \"Yet if it was not the 'movement,' or a clear-cut protest of any kind, Beatlemania was the first mass outburst of the '60s to feature women \u2013 in this case girls, who would not reach full adulthood until the '70s \u2013 and the emergence of a genuinely political movement for women's liberation.\"<ref name=\"Ehrenreich/Hess/Jacobs\" /> [[Derek Taylor]], the band's press officer in 1964 and from 1968 until their break-up, described the relationship between the Beatles and their fans as \"the twentieth century's greatest romance\".{{sfn|Frontani|2007|pp=19, 224}}\n\nThe first band after the Beatles to receive widespread attention for its fan following in the UK was [[T.

The group's popularity grew in the United Kingdom throughout 1963, propelled by the singles \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", \"[[From Me to You]]\" and \"[[She Loves You]]\". By October, the press adopted the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the scenes of adulation that attended the band's concert performances. From the start of 1964, their world tours were characterised by the same levels of hysteria and high-pitched screaming by female fans, both at concerts and during the group's travels. Commentators likened the intensity of this adulation to a religious fervour and to a female masturbation fantasy. Among the displays of [[deity]]-like worship, fans would approach the band in the belief that they possessed supernatural healing powers.\n\nIn February 1964, the Beatles arrived in the United States and their televised performances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' were viewed by approximately 73 million people. There, the band's instant popularity established their international stature, and their unprecedented domination of the national sales charts was similarly repeated in numerous other countries. Their August 1965 concert at New York's [[Shea Stadium]] marked the first time that a large outdoor stadium was used for such a purpose, and with an audience of 55,000, set records for attendance and revenue generation. To protect them from their fans, the Beatles typically travelled to these concerts by armoured car. From the end of that year, the band embraced promo clips for their singles to avoid the difficulties of making personal appearances on television programmes. Their December 1965 album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' marked a profound change in the dynamic between fans and artist, as many Beatles fans sought to appreciate the progressive quality in the band's look, lyrics and sound.\n\nIn 1966, [[John Lennon]] controversially remarked that the group had become \"[[more popular than Jesus]]\". Soon afterwards, when the Beatles [[The Beatles' 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines|toured Japan, the Philippines and the US]], they were entangled in mob revolt, violence, political backlash and threats of assassination. Frustrated by the restrictions of Beatlemania and unable to hear themselves play above their fans' screams, the group stopped touring and became a studio-only band. The success of their 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' defied commentators' speculation that abandoning live performances would lead to a decline in popularity. The last mass display of Beatlemania took place in July 1968 at the world premiere of the animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''.  \n\nBeatlemania surpassed any previous examples of fan worship In its intensity and scope. Initially, the fans were predominately young adolescent females, sometimes called \"[[teenybopper]]s\", and their behaviour was scorned by many commentators, particularly conservatives. By 1965, their fanbase included listeners who traditionally shunned youth-driven pop culture, which helped bridge divisions between [[folk music|folk]] and rock enthusiasts. During the 1960s, Beatlemania was the subject of analysis by [[Psychology|psychologists]] and [[Sociology|sociologists]]; a 1997 study recognised the phenomenon as an early demonstration of proto-[[Feminism|feminist]] [[girl power]]. The receptions of subsequent pop acts \u2013 particularly [[boy band]]s \u2013 have drawn comparisons to Beatlemania, although none have replicated the breadth and depth of the Beatles' [[fandom]] nor its cultural impact.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Interpretations and precursors==\n[[File:Aankomst Beatles op Schiphol, overzicht drukte op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 916-5134.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Members of the media swarm the Beatles at Amsterdam's [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]] in June 1964, as fans await them on top of the airport terminal.|alt=]]\n\nFrom 1963, [[the Beatles]] provided one of the first opportunities for female teenagers in Britain to exhibit spending power and publicly express sexual desire, while the group's image suggested a disregard for adults' opinions and parents' ideas of morality.{{sfn|Simonelli|2013|pp=19, 22\u201323}} In the description of author and musician [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]], the band's domestic breakthrough represented a \"final liberation\" for the nation's teenagers and, by coinciding with the end of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], the group \"effectively signaled the end of World War II in Britain\".{{sfn|Stanley|2014|p=85}}\n\nDuring the 1840s, fans of Hungarian pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] showed a level of fanaticism similar to that of the Beatles.

Academics proposed that the long hair signalled androgyny and thus presented a less threatening version of male sexuality to teenage girls, as well as allowing male fans to view the group in a sexual regard that they normally reserved for young females.

The band proved immensely popular during the tour, however, as journalist Gordon Sampson observed. His report did not use the word \"Beatlemania\", but the phenomenon was evident. Sampson wrote that \"a great reception went to the colourfully dressed Beatles, who almost stole the show, for the audience repeatedly called for them while other artists were performing!\"{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=124}} The Beatles' second nationwide tour began on 9 March at the Granada Cinema in London, where the group appeared on a bill headed by American stars [[Tommy Roe]] and [[Chris Montez]], both of whom had firmly established themselves in the UK singles charts.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=382}} Throughout the tour, the crowds repeatedly screamed for the Beatles, and the American stars were less popular than a homegrown act for the first time.

It soon became obvious that this was not going to change, and a week into the tour the covers of the souvenir programs were reprinted to place the Beatles above Orbison.

As the crowd chanted \"Yeah, yeah, yeah!\", some fans jostled with police officers and scaled the palace gates.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=213}} The impossibility of travelling without being mobbed led to the Beatles abandoning live television appearances to promote their singles.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=214}} In November, they filmed promotional clips for their double A-side single, \"[[Day Tripper]]\" / \"[[We Can Work It Out]]\", which could be played on shows such as ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. This relieved the band from travelling to TV studios around the UK and allowed them to focus on recording their next album, ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=215}} In her study of Beatlemania, sociologist Candy Leonard says that ''Rubber Soul'' challenged some young fans, due to its more sophisticated lyrical and musical content, but its release in December 1965 marked the moment when \"the Beatles came to occupy a role in fans' lives and a place in their psyches that was different from any previous fan\u2013performer relationship.\"{{sfn|Leonard|2014|pp=99, 101\u201302}}\n\n[[File:Rubber Soul.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front cover of the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' LP (designed by [[Robert Freeman (photographer)|Robert Freeman]])]]\nThe LP's cover contained a distorted, stretched image of the band's faces, which were nevertheless so instantly recognisable that no artist credit was necessary.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=49}}{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=335\u201336}} Its surreal quality led some fans to write to the band's official fanzine, ''[[Beatles Monthly]]'', alarmed that the group's appearance resembled that of corpses.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=49}} Leonard writes that ''Rubber Soul'' initiated \"close listening\" among the Beatles' fanbase, particularly with regard to song lyrics, and studying the cover was part of the listening experience.{{sfn|Leonard|2014|pp=97\u201398}} Fans were fascinated by the photo and the change in the band's look. In Leonard's study, male fans recalled the significance of the band members' longer hair, individual clothes, and collective self-assuredness. The reaction from female fans varied; one found the cover \"very sensual ... they looked grown up and sexy\", while another described it as \"scary, difficult, unpleasant\", adding: \"They looked menacing, like they were looking down on a victim. They looked like wooly mammoths, brown and leathery.\"{{sfn|Leonard|2014|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nIn the UK, the release was accompanied by speculation that the group's success would soon end, given that most acts there faded after two or three years at the top.{{sfn|Turner|2016|pp=16\u201317}} The Beatles had also defied convention and Epstein's wishes by drastically reducing their concert schedule in 1965,{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=141}} and they disappointed fans by refusing to reprise their annual ''Christmas Show'' season.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=335}} During the band's [[The Beatles' 1965 UK tour|UK tour]] that December, some newspapers reported that the intensity of the fans' passion appeared to have diminished.
