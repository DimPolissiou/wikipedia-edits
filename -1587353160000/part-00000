Members sit for [[Staggered elections|staggered terms]] lasting six years, with elections every year but almost a third of the 233 designates up for election every two years, specifically in even-numbered years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deshmukh|first=Yashwant|title=Crucial polls today: A guide to calculus of Rajya Sabha for dummies|website=Firstpost|date=11 June 2016|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/the-calculus-of-rajya-sabha-elections-for-dummies-a-brief-guide-2822478.html|accessdate=20 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619100417/http://www.firstpost.com/politics/the-calculus-of-rajya-sabha-elections-for-dummies-a-brief-guide-2822478.html|archivedate=19 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Rajya Sabha meets in continuous sessions, and unlike the [[Lok Sabha]], [[lower house|being the lower house of the Parliament]], the Rajya Sabha, which is the upper house of Parliament, is not subjected to dissolution. However, the Rajya Sabha, like the Lok Sabha can be [[Legislative session|prorogued]] by the President.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha has equal footing in legislation with the Lok Sabha, except in the area of [[Loss of supply|supply]], where the latter has overriding powers. In the case of conflicting legislation, a [[Joint Session of Indian Parliament|joint sitting]] of the two houses can be held, where the Lok Sabha would hold greater influence because of its larger membership. The [[Vice President of India]] (currently, [[Venkaiah Naidu]]) is the ''[[ex-officio]]'' Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions. The [[Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha|Deputy Chairman]], who is elected from amongst the house's members, takes care of the day-to-day matters of the house in the absence of the Chairman.

However, they are not entitled to vote in Presidential elections as per Article 55 of the Constitution.\n\n==Limitations==\nThe Constitution of India places some restrictions on Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha (The lower house, House of People) is more powerful in certain areas.\n\n===Money bills===\nThe definition of a money bill is given in article 110 of constitution of India. A money bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha by a minister and only on recommendation of President of India. When the Lok Sabha passes a money bill then the Lok Sabha sends money bill to the Rajya Sabha for 14 days during which it can make recommendations. Even if Rajya Sabha fails to return the money bill in 14 days to the Lok Sabha, that bill is deemed to have passed by both the Houses. Also, if the Lok Sabha rejects any (or all) of the amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of Parliament of India in the form the Lok Sabha finally passes it. Hence, Rajya Sabha can only give recommendations for a money bill but Rajya Sabha cannot amend a money bill. This is to ensure that Rajya Sabha must not add any non money matters in money bill. There is no joint sitting of both the houses with respect to money bills, because all final decisions are taken by the Lok Sabha.<ref>{{cite web|title=Website of the Rajya Sabha \u2013 Legislation|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/legislation/introduction.asp}}</ref>\n\n===Joint Sitting of the Parliament===\nArticle 108 provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament in certain cases. A joint sitting can be convened by the President of India when one house has either rejected a bill passed by the other house, has not taken any action on a bill transmitted to it by the other house for six months, or has disagreed to the amendments proposed by the Lok Sabha on a bill passed by it. Considering that the numerical strength of Lok Sabha is more than twice that of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha tends to have a greater influence in a joint sitting of Parliament. A joint session is chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha. Also, because the joint session is convened by the President on advice of the government, which already has a majority in Lok Sabha, the joint session is usually convened to get bills passed through a Rajya Sabha in which the government has a minority.\n\nJoint sessions of Parliament are a rarity, and have been convened three times in last 71 years, for the purpose of passage of a specific legislative act, the latest time being in 2002:\n* 1961: ''Dowry Prohibition Act, 1958''\n* 1978: ''Banking Services Commission (Repeal) Act, 1977''\n* 2002: ''Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002''\n\n===No-confidence motion===\nUnlike the Lok Sabha, a member of the Rajya Sabha cannot bring to the house a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] against the government.\n\n==Powers==\nIn the Indian federal structure, the Rajya Sabha is a representative of the States in the Union legislature (hence the name, '''Council of States'''). For this reason, the Rajya Sabha has powers that protect the rights of States against the union.\n\n===Union-state relations===\nThe Constitution empowers the Parliament of India to make laws on the matters reserved for States. However, this can only be done if the Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by a [[Supermajority#Two-thirds vote|two-thirds supermajority]] granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for states without any authorisation from Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe Union government reserves power to make laws directly affecting the citizens across all the states whereas, a single State in itself reserves power to make rules and governing laws of their region. If any bill passes through Rajya Sabha, that means, majority of states of the Union want that to happen. Rajya Sabha therefore, plays a vital role protecting the state's culture and interest.\n\n===Creation of All-India Services===\nThe Rajya Sabha, by a two-thirds supermajority can pass a resolution empowering the Government of India to create more All-India Services common to both Union and States.\n\n\n==Membership by party==\n\nMembers of Rajya Sabha by their political party (As of 10 April 2020):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.5/NewMembers/partystrength.aspx|title=STRENGTHWISE PARTY POSITION IN THE RAJYA SABHA|publisher=Rajya Sabha|date=18 July 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606134311/http://164.100.47.5/NewMembers/partystrength.aspx|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, they are not entitled to vote in Presidential elections as per Article 55 of the Constitution.\n\n==Limitations==\nThe Constitution of India places some restrictions on Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha (The lower house, House of People) is more powerful in certain areas.\n\n===Money bills===\nThe definition of a money bill is given in article 110 of constitution of India. A money bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha by a minister and only on recommendation of President of India. When the Lok Sabha passes a money bill then the Lok Sabha sends money bill to the Rajya Sabha for 14 days during which it can make recommendations. Even if Rajya Sabha fails to return the money bill in 14 days to the Lok Sabha, that bill is deemed to have passed by both the Houses. Also, if the Lok Sabha rejects any (or all) of the amendments proposed by the Rajya Sabha, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of Parliament of India in the form the Lok Sabha finally passes it. Hence, Rajya Sabha can only give recommendations for a money bill but Rajya Sabha cannot amend a money bill. This is to ensure that Rajya Sabha must not add any non money matters in money bill. There is no joint sitting of both the houses with respect to money bills, because all final decisions are taken by the Lok Sabha.<ref>{{cite web|title=Website of the Rajya Sabha \u2013 Legislation|url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/legislation/introduction.asp}}</ref>\n\n===Joint Sitting of the Parliament===\nArticle 108 provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament in certain cases. A joint sitting can be convened by the President of India when one house has either rejected a bill passed by the other house, has not taken any action on a bill transmitted to it by the other house for six months, or has disagreed to the amendments proposed by the Lok Sabha on a bill passed by it. Considering that the numerical strength of Lok Sabha is more than twice that of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha tends to have a greater influence in a joint sitting of Parliament. A joint session is chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha. Also, because the joint session is convened by the President on advice of the government, which already has a majority in Lok Sabha, the joint session is usually convened to get bills passed through a Rajya Sabha in which the government has a minority.\n\nJoint sessions of Parliament are a rarity, and have been convened three times in last 71 years, for the purpose of passage of a specific legislative act, the latest time being in 2002:\n* 1961: ''Dowry Prohibition Act, 1958''\n* 1978: ''Banking Services Commission (Repeal) Act, 1977''\n* 2002: ''Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002''\n\n===No-confidence motion===\nUnlike the Lok Sabha, a member of the Rajya Sabha cannot bring to the house a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] against the government.\n\n==Powers==\nIn the Indian federal structure, the Rajya Sabha is a representative of the States in the Union legislature (hence the name, '''Council of States'''). For this reason, the Rajya Sabha has powers that protect the rights of States against the union.\n\n===Union-state relations===\nThe Constitution empowers the Parliament of India to make laws on the matters reserved for States. However, this can only be done if the Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by a [[Supermajority#Two-thirds vote|two-thirds supermajority]] granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for states without any authorisation from Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe Union government reserves power to make laws directly affecting the citizens across all the states whereas, a single State in itself reserves power to make rules and governing laws of their region. If any bill passes through Rajya Sabha, that means, majority of states of the Union want that to happen. Rajya Sabha therefore, plays a vital role protecting the state's culture and interest.\n\n===Creation of All-India Services===\nThe Rajya Sabha, by a two-thirds supermajority can pass a resolution empowering the Government of India to create more All-India Services common to both Union and States.\n\n\n==Membership by party==\n\nMembers of Rajya Sabha by their political party (As of 10 April 2020):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.5/NewMembers/partystrength.aspx|title=STRENGTHWISE PARTY POSITION IN THE RAJYA SABHA|publisher=Rajya Sabha|date=18 July 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606134311/http://164.100.47.5/NewMembers/partystrength.aspx|archivedate=6 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

''Midwestern Hayride'' was first broadcast before 1937 and was carried live on radio each Saturday evening through the early 1970s.\n\nTelevision station WLW-T came on the air in 1948, sharing larger quarters with radio station WLW in the former Elks Building, re-christened Crosley Square. It eventually became the originating studio for the regional network Avco Broadcasting Corporation, which included [[WXIA|WLW-A]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[WDTN|WLW-D]] in Dayton, [[WCMH-TV|WLW-C]] in Columbus and later [[WTHR|WLW-I]] in Indianapolis (after WLW-A was sold) when the program moved to television in the early 1950s. Then originating from WLW-T, ''Midwestern Hayride'' was simulcast on WLW radio until the early 1960s, then was revived in the mid-60s. At the show's peak there was a one-year waiting list for tickets to be in the audience (100 people was the limit for each weekly show).\n\nIn 1951, ''Midwestern Hayride'' was picked up by NBC-TV as a summer replacement for [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''. NBC aired it each of the following summers through 1956, except 1953. ABC-TV then carried it during the summers of 1957&ndash;59. For much of its television run ''MH'' was hosted by Dean Richards, lead vocalist of The Lucky Pennies, a local singing group.  Richards also introduced a \"Polka Time\" segment (geared to Cincinnati's German heritage and its local breweries) aired near the program's close until 1969, when he was replaced by [[Henson Cargill]] riding on the success of his hit song \"Skip a Rope\".\n\nBy the early 1970s, then-16 year ''MH'' veteran [[Kenny Price]], a popular musician and comedian nicknamed The Round Mound of Sound, had a string of country hits for [[RCA Records]] including local favorite \"[[The Sheriff of Boone County]]\".  On the strength of those hits, Price was picked to be the new host of the show, which by then had shortened its name to ''Hayride'' (''Louisiana Hayride'' had succumbed to rock and roll's popularity and left the airwaves by 1960).\n\nLike many other locally produced shows of the day, ''Hayride'' become increasingly more expensive to produce, and WLW-TV executives decided to bring the show to an end in 1972.  Kenny Price became a regular on Nashville-based ''Hee Haw'' four years later and remained there until his death in 1987.\n\nIn 2009, [[WYNS-FM]], a low-power community FM station in [[Waynesville, Ohio]] (north of Cincinnati), announced it would commence a similar live weekly country music broadcast, ''The Ohio Hayride'', beginning May 15, 2010. The local program, possibly the first of its kind since the demise of ''Hayride'', was to feature local musicians as well as country music artists from past decades.

Written by Morrison and recorded in March 1967 for [[Bang Records]] owner and producer [[Bert Berns]], it was released as a single in June of the same year on the Bang label, peaking at number 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song spent a total of sixteen weeks on the chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/van-morrison|title=Van Morrison Brown Eyed Girl Chart History|website=Billboard}}</ref> It featured [[the Sweet Inspirations]] singing [[Backing vocalist|back-up vocals]] and is considered to be Van Morrison's [[signature song]].<ref>Yorke, Into the Music, p. 42</ref> \"Brown Eyed Girl\" has remained a staple on [[classic rock]] radio, and has been covered by hundreds of bands over the decades. This hit was written about Grace Modica of Long Island New York.\n\n==Recording and title==\nAfter finishing his contract with [[Decca Records]] and the mid-1966 break-up of his band, [[Them (band)|Them]], Morrison returned to Belfast seeking a new recording company. When he received a phone call from [[Bert Berns]], owner of [[Bang Records]], who had produced a number of recordings with Them, he flew to New York City and hastily signed a contract (which biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] says probably still gives him sleepless nights).<ref>Heylin, ''Can You Feel the Silence''. p.144-147</ref> During a two-day recording session starting 28 March 1967, he recorded eight songs intended to be used as four singles.<ref>Turner, Too Late to Stop Now. p.76</ref> The recording session took place at A & R Studios and \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was captured on the 22nd take on the first day.<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p. 152</ref> Of the musicians Berns had assembled, there were three guitarists \u2013 [[Eric Gale]], [[Hugh McCracken]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-illuminati.com/interview-jeff-barry/|title=Interview: Jeff Barry|publisher=music-illuminati.com|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref><ref>Rogan, ''No Surrender''. p.199</ref> and [[Al Gorgoni]] \u2013 plus bassist [[Russ Savakus]], pianist [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]] and drummer [[Gary Chester]].<ref>Heylin, ''Can You Feel the Silence?''. p. 150</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gary-chester.com/biography.html |title=Meet Gary |publisher=gary-chester.com |accessdate=21 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116225941/http://www.gary-chester.com/biography.html |archivedate=16 January 2012 }}</ref> It was released as a single in mid-June 1967.<ref>Rogan, ''No Surrender''. p.201</ref>\n\nOriginally titled \"Brown-Skinned Girl\",<ref name = \"SpenceCut103\">{{cite web|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/joseph-spence/the-complete-folkways-recordings-1958/caribbean-world/music/album/smithsonian|title=Smithsonian Folkways - Joseph Spence: The Complete Folkways Recordings, 1958|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2016}}</ref> Morrison changed it to \"Brown Eyed Girl\" when he recorded it.

A radio-edit of the song was released which removed the lyrics \"making love in the green grass\", replacing them with \"laughin' and a-runnin', hey hey\" from a previous verse. This edited version appears on some copies of the compilation album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison]]''. However, the remastered album seems{{clarify|date=October 2013}} to have the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]] lyrics in the packaging but the original \"racy\" lyrics on the disc. Lyrically, it \"shows early hints of the idealized pastoral landscapes that would flow through his songs through the decades, a tendency that links him to the Romantic poets, whom Morrison has cited as an influence\" according to music journalist Erik Hage.<ref>Hage, ''The Words and Music of Van Morrison'', pp. 33-34</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBecause of a contract he signed with Bang Records without legal advice, Morrison states that he has never received any [[royalties]] for writing or recording this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martaypix.com/VAN_at_Rancho_Nicasio/VAN_Rancho.html|title=Van Morrison at Rancho Nicasio|publisher=martaypix.com|accessdate= 27 August 2008}}</ref> The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid, and after those expenses were recouped, the revenue would become the \"subject of some highly creative accounting\".{{attribution needed|date=March 2018}}<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence. p.148</ref> Morrison vented frustration about this unjust contract in his sarcastic nonsense song \"The Big Royalty Check\". Morrison has stated that \"Brown Eyed Girl\" is not among his favourite songs, remarking \"it's not one of my best. I mean I've got about 300 songs that I think are better\".<ref>{{Cite video |title = TIME Magazine Interviews: Van Morrison | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date =26 February 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVHbUPNcTiU |minutes=4:14 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nTo capitalise on the success of the single, producer Berns assembled the album ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' without Morrison's input or knowledge. Released in September 1967, the album contained the single as its lead-off track as well as songs recorded by Morrison at the March recording sessions for Berns. The album peaked at No. 182 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Legacy==\nMorrison's original recording of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains widely familiar today, as the uncensored version is regularly played by many \"[[oldies]]\" and \"[[classic rock]]\" radio stations. In 2005, Morrison received a Million-Air certificate by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a \"Top European Writer\" for reaching 7 million US radio and television airplays for \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and again in 2007, Morrison was awarded another Million-Air certificate by BMI for 8 million air plays of \"Brown Eyed Girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|title=BMI Honors Top European Writers|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=23 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065908/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535578|title=Peter Gabriel Receives Top Honor at BMI Awards|publisher=BMI|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> In 2009, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was at the top of the list for most played songs at the BMI London awards winning a Million-Air certificate for 9 million air plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/539750|title=BMI London Awards|date=9 October 2009|publisher=BMI|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> In 2011, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" joined an elite group of songs as it was honoured for having 10 million US radio air plays and therefore becoming one of the ten songs that have been registered with BMI that have received that number of radio plays.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/my-10-million-radio-plays-brown-eyed-girl-2896314.html|title=My 10 million radio plays Brown Eyed Girl|journal=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref> As of 2015, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains the most downloaded and most played song of the entire 1960s decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6472929/revisionist-history-valentines-day-edition-captain-tennille |title=Revisionist History, Valentine's Day Edition: Captain & Tennille Crunches Aerosmith, Van Morrison Boots Lulu |last=Appel |first=Rich |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=14 February 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] included \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in his book ''Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles'',<ref>Williams, Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles. p. 122</ref> writing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"I was going to say this is a song about sex, and it is, and a song about youth and growing up, and memory, and it's also\u2014very much and very wonderfully\u2014a song about singing.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis song proved to be the impetus for Morrison's career. It was his first single after leaving his position as lead singer for the [[Belfast]]-formed [[Them (band)|Them]] and led to his relocation to the United States and an eventual [[recording contract|contract]] with [[Warner Bros.

A radio-edit of the song was released which removed the lyrics \"making love in the green grass\", replacing them with \"laughin' and a-runnin', hey hey\" from a previous verse. This edited version appears on some copies of the compilation album ''[[The Best of Van Morrison]]''. However, the remastered album seems{{clarify|date=October 2013}} to have the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]] lyrics in the packaging but the original \"racy\" lyrics on the disc. Lyrically, it \"shows early hints of the idealized pastoral landscapes that would flow through his songs through the decades, a tendency that links him to the Romantic poets, whom Morrison has cited as an influence\" according to music journalist Erik Hage.<ref>Hage, ''The Words and Music of Van Morrison'', pp. 33-34</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nBecause of a contract he signed with Bang Records without legal advice, Morrison states that he has never received any [[royalties]] for writing or recording this song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martaypix.com/VAN_at_Rancho_Nicasio/VAN_Rancho.html|title=Van Morrison at Rancho Nicasio|publisher=martaypix.com|accessdate= 27 August 2008}}</ref> The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid, and after those expenses were recouped, the revenue would become the \"subject of some highly creative accounting\".{{attribution needed|date=March 2018}}<ref>Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence. p.148</ref> Morrison vented frustration about this unjust contract in his sarcastic nonsense song \"The Big Royalty Check\". Morrison has stated that \"Brown Eyed Girl\" is not among his favourite songs, remarking \"it's not one of my best. I mean I've got about 300 songs that I think are better\".<ref>{{Cite video |title = TIME Magazine Interviews: Van Morrison | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date =26 February 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVHbUPNcTiU |minutes=4:14 |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nTo capitalise on the success of the single, producer Berns assembled the album ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' without Morrison's input or knowledge. Released in September 1967, the album contained the single as its lead-off track as well as songs recorded by Morrison at the March recording sessions for Berns. The album peaked at No. 182 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Legacy==\nMorrison's original recording of \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains widely familiar today, as the uncensored version is regularly played by many \"[[oldies]]\" and \"[[classic rock]]\" radio stations. In 2005, Morrison received a Million-Air certificate by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a \"Top European Writer\" for reaching 7 million US radio and television airplays for \"Brown Eyed Girl\" and again in 2007, Morrison was awarded another Million-Air certificate by BMI for 8 million air plays of \"Brown Eyed Girl\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|title=BMI Honors Top European Writers|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=23 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065908/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535578|title=Peter Gabriel Receives Top Honor at BMI Awards|publisher=BMI|date=16 October 2007|accessdate=21 January 2012}}</ref> In 2009, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" was at the top of the list for most played songs at the BMI London awards winning a Million-Air certificate for 9 million air plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/539750|title=BMI London Awards|date=9 October 2009|publisher=BMI|accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> In 2011, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" joined an elite group of songs as it was honoured for having 10 million US radio air plays and therefore becoming one of the ten songs that have been registered with BMI that have received that number of radio plays.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/my-10-million-radio-plays-brown-eyed-girl-2896314.html|title=My 10 million radio plays Brown Eyed Girl|journal=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref> As of 2015, \"Brown Eyed Girl\" remains the most downloaded and most played song of the entire 1960s decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6472929/revisionist-history-valentines-day-edition-captain-tennille |title=Revisionist History, Valentine's Day Edition: Captain & Tennille Crunches Aerosmith, Van Morrison Boots Lulu |last=Appel |first=Rich |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=14 February 2015 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] included \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in his book ''Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles'',<ref>Williams, Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles. p. 122</ref> writing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"I was going to say this is a song about sex, and it is, and a song about youth and growing up, and memory, and it's also\u2014very much and very wonderfully\u2014a song about singing.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis song proved to be the impetus for Morrison's career. It was his first single after leaving his position as lead singer for the [[Belfast]]-formed [[Them (band)|Them]] and led to his relocation to the United States and an eventual [[recording contract|contract]] with [[Warner Bros.

The enlistment draft is held in early-April annually. On the draftee selection day, those who are called up for the draft report to their selection center at 07:00. During roll call, eligible draftees can request to volunteer to serve, or they may choose to stay for the lottery. Those who volunteer then undergo physical and mental health examinations including a urine test for drugs.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\">{{cite news|last1=Laohong|first1=King-Oua|title=12,000 draftees 'on drugs'|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1448931/12-000-draftees-on-drugs|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=20 April 2018}}</ref> The results of the urine test for drugs are entered into a Narcotics Control Board database. In 2018, of the first 182,910 men entered in the database, 12,209 men, or 6.7 percent, tested positive for drugs: 11,139 for [[methamphetamine]], 750 for [[marijuana]], and the remainder for other drugs. Over 3,000 of those who tested positive will serve in the military where they will receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Those who tested positive, but who were not drafted, will undergo a 13-day rehabilitation regimen in their home provinces.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\" />  Those who do not pass the physical and mental health examinations are promptly discharged. The enlisting volunteers then choose the service branch (Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, or Royal Thai Air Force) and the reporting date of their choice, and receive documentation of the year's draft selection, and an enlistment order to report for basic training with notification details of the reporting time and location. The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

Lcweb2.loc.gov. Retrieved on 18 January 2012.</ref> Many Thai military uniforms reflect historical foreign influences. For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school.

The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialised training.\n\nFormal honours and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition. The government grants numerous awards, and outstanding acts of heroism, courage, and meritorious service receive prompt recognition.\n\n===Officer and enlisted rank insignia===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Thailand}}\n|}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Thailand}}\n|}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Thai soldiers and Type 85 APCs during 2010 Thai political protests.jpg|RTA troops take cover next to a [[Type 85 AFV]] near the Red Shirt barricade at [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]]\nFile:2010 0513 silom 11.JPG|Soldiers with riot shields at a barricade on [[Silom Road]] and Soi Convent\nFile:2010 0513 saladaeng station 02.JPG|Soldiers beneath Saladaeng BTS station, Silom Road\nFile:2010 0513 silom 07.JPG|Soldiers and a helmeted journalist buy water and food, Silom Road\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 02.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, [[Chiang Mai]], days after the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 01.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, Chiang Mai\nFile:Defense.gov News Photo 110211-M-VX252-046 - Royal Thai and U.S. Marines discuss how to eliminate hostile forces firing on them from a building during a mock mechanized raid on Feb. 11 2011.jpg|[[Royal Thai Marine Corps|Royal Thai]] and [[US Marines]] eliminating hostile forces during a mock raid, 11 February 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-027.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces service member clears a building during a mock raid, [[Cobra Gold]], 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-017.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces clear a building during a mock raid, Cobra Gold, 2011\nFile:Thai service members participate in a rivierine subject matter expert exchange with U.S. Sailors in the Nakhon Nayok River as part of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2013 in Thailand June 8 130608-N-RG360-224.jpg|Thai troops in a riverine exercise with US sailors on the Nakhon Nayok River, [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT), 8 June 2013\nFile:Rtaf All FlighterJet.jpg|RTAF fighters: [[JAS 39 Gripen]], [[F-16|F-16 ADF]], [[Northrop F-5|F-5]], [[Alpha jet]], [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] and [[SAAB-340]]\nFile:HTMS Naresuan in Hong Kong.JPG|RTN frigate [[HTMS Naresuan]] FFG-421 moored in [[Victoria Harbour]], Hong Kong\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Border Patrol Police]]\n* [[King's Guard (Thailand)]]\n* [[List of flags of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]]\n* [[Military ranks of the Thai armed forces]]\n* [[Royal Thai Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Thai Police]]\n* [[Territorial Defence Student]]\n* [[Thahan Phran]]\n* [[Underwater Demolition Assault Unit]]\n* [[Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{loc}}\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Osornprasop, Sutayut. \"Thailand and the Secret War in Laos\", 1960\u20131974 (in) Albert Lau (ed.), ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War''.

It is affiliated with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. Upon its founding in 1869, it was a [[Norwegian-American]] [[Lutheran]] [[seminary]] known as '''Augsburg Seminarium'''. Its first college class began in the fall of 1874. Today, the university enrolls approximately 3,000 [[undergraduate]] students and 800 [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] students. The school is known for its emphasis on service learning; volunteering in the community is both an instructional strategy and a required part of a student's coursework. In 2010, Augsburg was one of the six higher education institutions to receive the Presidential Award for Community Service, sponsored by the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/honor-roll/2010 |title=2010 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll &#124; Corporation for National and Community Service |website=Nationalservice.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720040418/http://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/honor-roll/2010 |archive-date=July 20, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2017, the name of the school was changed from Augsburg College to Augsburg University.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Augsburg College Sign.jpg|thumb|200px|left]]\n\nAugsburg was founded as a [[seminary]] by Norwegian Lutherans. It was named after the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530, the primary confession of faith presented by [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] in [[Augsburg, Germany]], and contained in the ''[[Book of Concord]]'' of 1580. '''Augsburg Seminarium''' opened in September 1869, in [[Marshall, Dane County, Wisconsin|Marshall, Wisconsin]]. Three years later, by 1873, it moved to [[Minneapolis]], changing its name to '''The Norwegian Danish Evangelical Lutheran Augsburg Seminary''' to reflect the name of the [[Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America|church body]] that sponsored the school. Expanding its mission, undergraduate classes began in the fall of 1874, with the first class graduating in the spring of 1879. In 1892, the school's name was shortened to '''Augsburg Seminary'''. In 1893, reacting to what it deemed overly-hierarchical elements in the Norwegian church, Augsburg leaders organized the \"Friends of Augsburg\", which, by 1897 had coalesced to form a new Lutheran denomination, the [[Lutheran Free Church]], a body that flourished for 70 years. During its early years the college and seminary served men only, with women first admitted to the school in 1921. To further expand its mission, a high school level '''Augsburg Academy''' was provided on the campus until it closed in 1933.\n\nAugsburg Seminary remained the name of the school until 1942, when its name was officially changed and expanded to '''Augsburg College and Theological Seminary''', a name that had been informally used since the 1910s. When the Lutheran Free Church merged with the much larger [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC) in 1963, Augsburg Seminary merged with the ALC's Luther Theological Seminary, later renamed [[Luther Seminary]].<ref>The 1950s and 1960s had a flurry of mergers between smaller Lutheran denominations, thus their seminaries followed suit: \"Luther Seminary\" was chosen as the name after a ''second merger'' with neighboring Northwestern Theological Seminary of the former [[Lutheran Church in America]], of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].</ref> The name of the remaining undergraduate college became '''Augsburg College'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburg.edu/now/2017/05/30/augsburg-university/|title=Augsburg University - Augsburg Now|website=www.augsburg.edu}}</ref> In 2017, the name of the school officially became '''Augsburg University'''.\n\n[[August Weenaas]] was Augsburg's first president (1869-1876). Weenaas recruited two teachers from [[Norway]]\u2014[[Sven Oftedal]] and [[Georg Sverdrup]]. These three men clearly articulated the direction of Augsburg: to educate [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[Lutherans]] to minister to immigrants and to provide such \"college\" studies that would prepare students for theological study.\n\nIn 1874, they proposed a three-part plan: first, train ministerial candidates; second, prepare future theological students; and third, educate the farmer, worker, and businessman. The statement stressed that a good education is also practical. Augsburg's next two presidents also emphatically rejected ivory tower concepts of education. This commitment to church and community has led to Augsburg's theme of over 130 years: Education for Service.\n[[File:Hillary Clinton Feb 3 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Hillary Clinton]] campaigning at Augsburg, two days before [[Super Tuesday (2008)|Super Tuesday 2008]].]]\n[[File:Nobel Peace Prize Flags at Augsburg.jpg|thumb|Flags fly at Augsburg, during the 25th annual Nobel Peace Prize Forum (2013).]]\nThis seminarian focus began to change after [[World War I]]. In 1911, [[George Sverdrup]] Jr. became president. He worked to develop college departments with an appeal to a broader range of students than just those intending to be ministers. In 1937, Augsburg elected Bernhard Christensen, an erudite and scholarly teacher, to be president (1938-1962). His involvement in ecumenical and civic circles made Augsburg a more visible part of church and city life. After [[World War II]], Augsburg leaders made vigorous efforts to expand and improve academic offerings. Thus by mid-century, the undergraduate college had become a larger part of the institution than the seminary and received the most attention.\n\nAs a result, Augsburg steadily added departments essential to a liberal arts college, offering a modern college program based on general education requirements and elective majors. Augsburg aims to reflect the commitment and dedication of its founders who believed \"an Augsburg education should be preparation for service in community and church\", [by] \"Providing an education grounded in vocational calling, that provides students both the theoretical learning and the practical experience to succeed in a global, diverse world.\"<ref name=\"abedu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburg.edu/about/history.html |title=History - About Augsburg College &#124; Augsburg College |website=Augsburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Nobel Peace Prize Forum ===\nIn 2012 and 2013, Augsburg University housed the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Forum.

It is affiliated with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. Upon its founding in 1869, it was a [[Norwegian-American]] [[Lutheran]] [[seminary]] known as '''Augsburg Seminarium'''. Its first college class began in the fall of 1874. Today, the university enrolls approximately 3,000 [[undergraduate]] students and 800 [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] students. The school is known for its emphasis on service learning; volunteering in the community is both an instructional strategy and a required part of a student's coursework. In 2010, Augsburg was one of the six higher education institutions to receive the Presidential Award for Community Service, sponsored by the [[Corporation for National and Community Service]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/honor-roll/2010 |title=2010 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll &#124; Corporation for National and Community Service |website=Nationalservice.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720040418/http://www.nationalservice.gov/special-initiatives/honor-roll/2010 |archive-date=July 20, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2017, the name of the school was changed from Augsburg College to Augsburg University.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Augsburg College Sign.jpg|thumb|200px|left]]\n\nAugsburg was founded as a [[seminary]] by Norwegian Lutherans. It was named after the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530, the primary confession of faith presented by [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] in [[Augsburg, Germany]], and contained in the ''[[Book of Concord]]'' of 1580. '''Augsburg Seminarium''' opened in September 1869, in [[Marshall, Dane County, Wisconsin|Marshall, Wisconsin]]. Three years later, by 1873, it moved to [[Minneapolis]], changing its name to '''The Norwegian Danish Evangelical Lutheran Augsburg Seminary''' to reflect the name of the [[Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America|church body]] that sponsored the school. Expanding its mission, undergraduate classes began in the fall of 1874, with the first class graduating in the spring of 1879. In 1892, the school's name was shortened to '''Augsburg Seminary'''. In 1893, reacting to what it deemed overly-hierarchical elements in the Norwegian church, Augsburg leaders organized the \"Friends of Augsburg\", which, by 1897 had coalesced to form a new Lutheran denomination, the [[Lutheran Free Church]], a body that flourished for 70 years. During its early years the college and seminary served men only, with women first admitted to the school in 1921. To further expand its mission, a high school level '''Augsburg Academy''' was provided on the campus until it closed in 1933.\n\nAugsburg Seminary remained the name of the school until 1942, when its name was officially changed and expanded to '''Augsburg College and Theological Seminary''', a name that had been informally used since the 1910s. When the Lutheran Free Church merged with the much larger [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC) in 1963, Augsburg Seminary merged with the ALC's Luther Theological Seminary, later renamed [[Luther Seminary]].<ref>The 1950s and 1960s had a flurry of mergers between smaller Lutheran denominations, thus their seminaries followed suit: \"Luther Seminary\" was chosen as the name after a ''second merger'' with neighboring Northwestern Theological Seminary of the former [[Lutheran Church in America]], of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].</ref> The name of the remaining undergraduate college became '''Augsburg College'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburg.edu/now/2017/05/30/augsburg-university/|title=Augsburg University - Augsburg Now|website=www.augsburg.edu}}</ref> In 2017, the name of the school officially became '''Augsburg University'''.\n\n[[August Weenaas]] was Augsburg's first president (1869-1876). Weenaas recruited two teachers from [[Norway]]\u2014[[Sven Oftedal]] and [[Georg Sverdrup]]. These three men clearly articulated the direction of Augsburg: to educate [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[Lutherans]] to minister to immigrants and to provide such \"college\" studies that would prepare students for theological study.\n\nIn 1874, they proposed a three-part plan: first, train ministerial candidates; second, prepare future theological students; and third, educate the farmer, worker, and businessman. The statement stressed that a good education is also practical. Augsburg's next two presidents also emphatically rejected ivory tower concepts of education. This commitment to church and community has led to Augsburg's theme of over 130 years: Education for Service.\n[[File:Hillary Clinton Feb 3 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Hillary Clinton]] campaigning at Augsburg, two days before [[Super Tuesday (2008)|Super Tuesday 2008]].]]\n[[File:Nobel Peace Prize Flags at Augsburg.jpg|thumb|Flags fly at Augsburg, during the 25th annual Nobel Peace Prize Forum (2013).]]\nThis seminarian focus began to change after [[World War I]]. In 1911, [[George Sverdrup]] Jr. became president. He worked to develop college departments with an appeal to a broader range of students than just those intending to be ministers. In 1937, Augsburg elected Bernhard Christensen, an erudite and scholarly teacher, to be president (1938-1962). His involvement in ecumenical and civic circles made Augsburg a more visible part of church and city life. After [[World War II]], Augsburg leaders made vigorous efforts to expand and improve academic offerings. Thus by mid-century, the undergraduate college had become a larger part of the institution than the seminary and received the most attention.\n\nAs a result, Augsburg steadily added departments essential to a liberal arts college, offering a modern college program based on general education requirements and elective majors. Augsburg aims to reflect the commitment and dedication of its founders who believed \"an Augsburg education should be preparation for service in community and church\", [by] \"Providing an education grounded in vocational calling, that provides students both the theoretical learning and the practical experience to succeed in a global, diverse world.\"<ref name=\"abedu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburg.edu/about/history.html |title=History - About Augsburg College &#124; Augsburg College |website=Augsburg.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Nobel Peace Prize Forum ===\nIn 2012 and 2013, Augsburg University housed the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Forum.
