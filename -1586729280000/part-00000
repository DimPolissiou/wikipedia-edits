Harding]] in 1923. As the [[25th Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] had not yet been passed, Coolidge served the remainder of Harding's term without a vice president. The 1924 Republican Convention was thus tasked with picking a running mate for Coolidge.\n\nWith Coolidge having locked up the presidential nomination, most attention was focused on the vice presidential nomination. Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] of California and appellate judge [[William S. Kenyon (Iowa politician)|William Kenyon]] of Iowa were seen as the front-runners for the nomination, as both were popular Western progressives who could provide balance to a ticket led by a conservative from Massachusetts.<ref name=oulahan/> Coolidge's first choice was reported to be Idaho Senator [[William E. Borah]], also a progressive Westerner, but Borah declined to be considered.<ref name=oulahan/> Illinois Governor [[Frank O. Lowden]], University of Michigan president [[Marion Leroy Burton]], Ambassador [[Charles B. Warren]] of Michigan, Washington Senator [[Wesley Livsey Jones]], college president [[John Lee Coulter]] of North Dakota, General [[James Harbord]], and General [[Charles Dawes]] also had support as potential running mates.<ref name=oulahan>{{cite news|last1=Oulahan|first1=Richard V.|title=Kenyon Leads for Second Place on Convention Eve, New Move to \"Draft\" Lowden Fails; Hoover Strong; La Follette Starts Fight for a Radical Platform|url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/240610convention-gop-ra.html|accessdate=October 9, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 1924}}</ref> Despite saying that he would not accept the nomination, Lowden was nominated for Vice President on the second ballot over Dawes, Kenyon, and Ohio Representative [[Theodore E.

Anderson (bishop)|William F. Anderson]], Methodist Episcopal bishop of Boston.  Among other things, he called for \"stricter observance of the law and the preservation of the Constitution of the United States\", in other words, for more zealous enforcement of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].<ref>Official Report of the Proceedings of the Eighteenth Republican National Convention (1928), pp. 7\u20139</ref>\n\nThe next day's session was opened by Rev. Dr. [[Samuel Schulman]], rabbi of [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Beth-El]] in New York. Schulman spoke with appreciation for \"the Republican Party's precious heritage of the championship of human rights\"; he called for \"every form of prejudice and misunderstanding\" to be \"driven forever out of our land\". Speaking of [[Calvin Coolidge]], he praised \"the integrity, the wisdom, the fearlessness of our beloved President\".<ref>Official Report of the Proceedings of the Eighteenth Republican National Convention, published by the Republican National Committee (1924), pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nOn June 12, the final day's invocation was given by Roman Catholic Bishop [[Joseph Schrembs]] of Cleveland. Schrembs characterized President Calvin Coolidge as \"a chieftain whose record of faithful public service, and whose personality, untarnished and untainted by the pollution of political corruption, will fill the heart of America with the new hope of a second spring\".<ref>Official Report of the Proceedings of the Eighteenth Republican National Convention, published by the Republican National Committee (1924), pp. 125\u201326</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the United States Republican Party]]\n*[[List of Republican National Conventions]]\n*[[U.S. presidential nomination convention]]\n*[[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1924]]\n*[[1924 United States presidential election]]\n*[[1924 Democratic National Convention]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29636 Republican Party platform of 1924] at ''The American Presidency Project''\n\n{{sequence|\n prev=[[1920 Republican National Convention|1920]]<br />[[Chicago, Illinois]]|\n list=[[Republican National Convention]]s|\n next=[[1928 Republican National Convention|1928]]<br />[[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{United States presidential election, 1924}}\n{{Calvin Coolidge}}\n{{Republican National Convention}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Republican National Conventions]]\n[[Category:20th century in Cleveland|Republican National Convention, 1924]]\n[[Category:1924 United States presidential election]]\n[[Category:1924 in Ohio]]\n[[Category:1924 conferences]]\n[[Category:June 1924 events]]\n", "name_user": "Saxones288", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVice Presidential nomination", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Republican_National_Convention"}

Melissa lives in the shadow of Tripp Zoome, the adventurous and clever hero from her father's popular spy novels. Before a long overdue father-daughter vacation, her father gets kidnapped by obsessive fans: Wheeze with his friend, Sheldon and his brother, Andre.\n\nHowever, the tables turn when she must team up with them to find and rescue him from Merv and his brothers, Maurice and Skunk. It turns out Merv is just using Skunk and Maurice as part of a plan to get Neal to write one final book and uses his daughter as a hostage. Wheeze, Andre and Sheldon get all of the Trip Zoome fans in town to gather together to rescue Melissa and Neal and they attack when Melissa manages to signal them.\n\nThe fans attack Merv, Maurice and Skunk and they try to run but are stopped by more fans. Merv sneaks out with Neil while Skunk and Maurice go after Melissa who escapes. Melissa defeats them and ties them up. Merv nearly gets away, but Sheldon, who had been trying to find where everyone went, spots him and alerts everyone else. Neil is rescued, but Merv tries to get away.\n\nAs he runs, Maurice and Skunk, still tied up, come out and see this and, regretting what they've done, use the floss they're bound in to trip Merv, knocking him down and ending his escape. The police arrest Maurice, Merv and Skunk while Neil thanks his fans.

Since 1987, successive governments attempted to reform it as stated by the constitution it was created to maintain peace, enforce law and order in accordance with the rule of law, to protect its citizens and to arrest those that violate the law. However the police, being plagued by militarism, factionalism, and corruption, is mainly viewed by citizens as being repressive.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution proposed the establishment of a separate police corps and a new police academy under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. Political developments in Haiti since 1987, however, have precluded implementation of these changes. Nevertheless, the mission of the police corps was almost indistinguishable from the mission spelled out for the [[Armed Forces of Haiti|FAd'H]]. The characterization of the police as a ''corps arm\u00e9e'' (armed corps) reinforced this similarity in missions.\n\nThe only identifiable police force in Haiti operated in Port-au-Prince as part of the armed forces. This 1,000-member force had few operational or technical capabilities, even though it was responsible for narcotics and immigration control and criminal investigations. In the late 1980s, the Narcotics Bureau, commanded by an army major, had acquired some visibility and resources of its own, with a reported staff of about twenty-five people.\n\nThere was no true rural police. Small garrisons, operating under military department command, with some cooperation from the lowest central government administrative head, section chief (chef de section), were responsible for rural security. In effect, the heads of these 562 rural communal sections (sections rurales communales) functioned as police chiefs, as adjuncts of the nation's military infrastructure. This fusion of civil and military administration continued to be possible because of the broad range of responsibilities assigned to the Ministry of Interior and National Defense.\n\nAfter 1986 the armed forces failed to reestablish a nationwide police force and to subdue the [[Tonton Macoute|MVSN]] and other [[vigilante group]]s. Some observers have argued that links between the senior army command and remnants of the MVSN have paralyzed reforms in Haiti's judicial system. An illustration of their point was the reported incorporation of some MVSN personnel into FAd'H units and some members of the VSN, as plainclothes paramilitary agents, in the Dessalines Battalion. Other MVSN members found their way into cadres of the Port-au-Prince police force, particularly in the Criminal Investigation Unit (Recheraches Criminelles\u2014renamed in 1988 the Anti-Gang Investigations Bureau), which was traditionally based at the Dessalines barracks. The demise of the Dessalines Battalion and the Leopards, the latter of which had served as Haiti's special weapons and tactics unit, raised questions in the spring of 1989 about the future of a national police force.\n\nThe Avril government reported some success in cracking down on abuses within the security services, but violence continued to be a serious problem. Insecurity rose dramatically after 1986 with the formation of ad hoc paramilitary groups that had direct links to the VSN and indirect links to the military. Many of these paramilitary groups engaged in banditry with no political motivation. The security situation in rural regions and at the section chief level remained unclear in 1989.\n\nThe human-rights record of post-Duvalier governments was generally negative. A major problem was the inability, or the unwillingness, of the FAd'H to contain domestic political violence. Government and military personnel apparently sanctioned and participated in attacks on politicians and other activists, particularly during the second Namphy government. The Avril government boasted an improved record in this area, but as of mid-1989, it had proved incapable of restoring order.\n\nHaitian military and police often brutally interrogated detainees. Rural section chiefs, who wielded considerable power within their limited jurisdictions, arbitrarily harassed and physically abused citizens, according to some reports. In an effort to address this problem, Avril dismissed a number of section chiefs, and issued a decree in December 1988 that ended appointments of section chiefs and proposed putting the posts up for election (see Urban Dominance, Rural Stagnation, ch. 9).\n\nHarsh conditions prevailed in the prison system. Hygiene, food, and health care were inadequate, and prison staff regularly mistreated inmates. The Avril government closed two facilities closely associated with the repression of the Duvalier regimes\u2014 [[Fort Dimanche]] and the detention center of the Criminal Investigation Unit, both in Port-au-Prince\u2014because of the abuses that had commonly taken place there.\n\nPolitical turmoil between 1986 and 1989 resulted in popular justice and mob violence. The international media reported on some of this violence and featured scenes of burning or dismembered bodies. Continued human-rights violations are likely to attract international criticism during the 1990s. Lasting improvements in internal security, however, appeared unlikely without the establishment of functional civilian institutions and some resolution of the status of the former members of the tonton makouts. \n \nIn 1995, Haiti disbanded its military, which formerly provided police services in rural areas and operated the Port-au-Prince Police.\n\nDuring President Aristide's second term (2000\u221204) political appointees took over many key positions in the PNH. In many instances, these appointees lacked security experience and compromised the political neutrality of the force. After Aristide fled the country, the interim president removed 200 corrupt and inexperienced officers in an effort to improve the PNH's effectiveness. New training ensued to teach police officers how to balance security and human rights concerns. However, numerous problems limit the PNH's effectiveness and reliability. Former military personnel exert considerable influence within the police force, and some have begun to push for the reestablishment of the Haitian army.\n\nSince its inception, the PNH has suffered from mismanagement, corruption, and a lack of funding. MINUSTAH has helped make up for the shortfalls of the PNH since it arrived in Haiti in 2004. Many security operations have been undertaken jointly by the PNH and MINUSTAH. Nevertheless, rampant crime and gang violence continue to be the most immediate problem facing Haitian authorities.<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf|title=About this Collection - Country Studies|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==General Organization==\nThe PNH is currently headed by the Director General ([[chief of police]]) Michel-Ange Gedeon appointed by president Privert to a three-year term.\n\nAlthough officially part of the police force, the Presidential Security Unit operates with its own budget and administration.<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/>\n\n===National Organization===\nThe National organization of the PNH is as follows:\n\n* Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Police Nationale d\u2019Haiti or DGPNH (General Directorate of the National Police of Haiti)\n* Inspection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Police Nationale d\u2019Haiti or IGPNH  (Inspector General of the National Police of Haiti)\n* Direction des Renseignements G\u00e9n\u00e9raux or DRG (Direction of the General Information)\n* Cabinet Du directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Police Nationale d\u2019Haiti - CAB ( Cabinet of the Director General of the National Police of Haiti)\n* Direction du D\u00e9veloppement Ou Commissariat au Plan or DDCP (Direction of the Development or Planning Commission)\n\n==Centrally controlled organizations==\n\n===General and Administrative Services===\nDirection Centrale de l\u2019Administration et des Services G\u00e9n\u00e9raux or DCASG (Central Directorate of the Administration and General Services) is responsible for human resources, the finances, and logistics needs of the National Police of Haiti It includes the following components:<ref name=\"156.29\">{{Cite web |url=http://67.227.156.29/~pnh//dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=8 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121183221/http://67.227.156.29/~pnh/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=8 |archive-date=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n# La Direction des Finances et de la Comptabilit\u00e9 (DFC) - The Directorate of Finance and Accounting\n# La Direction du Personnel (DP) - The Directorate of Personnel\n# La Direction de la Logistique (DL) - The Directorate of Logistics\n# La Direction des Ecoles et de la Formation Permanente (DEFP) - The Directorate of Schools and Continuing Education\n# L'Administration P\u00e9nitentiaire Nationale (APENA) The National Penitentiary Administration\n\n===Administrative Police===\nDirection Centrale de la Police Administratrive or DCPA (Central Directorate of the Administrative Police force) Under Article 28 of the Act establishing and organizing the National Police, the Central Directorate of Administrative Police (DCPA) is the body responsible for designing and implementing measures to safeguard the peace, tranquility and good public order.

In addition, attention to executive reward Haitian militancy of its supporters by awarding positions in public administration, including the PNH, had greatly influenced the recruitment of new Haitian officers.\n\nThe personal allegiance required of new graduates of the academy and the police school by the Head of State made training and effective monitoring of the members of the police force difficult. This resulted in an officer cadre whose training and ethics are inadequate, and that a significant fraction is related to human rights abuses, drug trafficking, illicit enrichment, and most vicious crimes, including the latest fashion is to say the kidnapping of peaceful and honest citizens, as well as their wives and their children.\n\nIn recruiting members, including the transfer or promotion of any member to a new assignment, the PNH will:\n\n* Using the constitutional provisions, laws of the Republic and its internal rules to reject any interference from political authorities in the efficient functioning of the police institution, especially as regards the management of its human resources;\n* Using modern means of communication, including media, to inform the population, in the most comprehensive and transparent on its recruitment goals and general employment opportunities, in order to equalize the chances of participation of any individual qualified;\n* Strengthen the process of selection of all candidates for a career in the police institution, both pre-requisite personnel, supporting documentation required, as written examinations, medical, physical and psychological, including a further verification of the personal history of candidates, particularly in relation to their performance in previous jobs, general crime, abuse of human rights and domestic violence;\n* Apply a uniform and consistent testing, standards and regulations relating to recruitment;\n* Train managers and other employees of the institution to an efficient, impartial and professional staff recruitment;\n* Seek foreign assistance, as needed, to strengthen the management capacity of the recruitment process, particularly as related to verification of the candidate's personal history, skills and psychological profile of candidates.\n\n==Vehicles==\n*[[Ram Pickup|Dodge Ram]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashhaiti.com/ads-library/Inspection+Generale+de+La+Police+National+d'Haiti+(PNH)/pnh-ad53.jpg|title=Wayback Machine|website=web-beta.archive.org}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n*[[Lenco BearCat|Lenco Bearcat]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashhaiti.com/ads-library/Inspection+Generale+de+La+Police+National+d'Haiti+(PNH)/pnh-ad51.jpg|title=Wayback Machine|website=web-beta.archive.org}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n*[[Nissan Navara|Nissan Frontier]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/haitian-police-patrol-the-streets-in-port-au-prince-on-news-photo/463084818?esource=SEO_GIS_CDN_Redirect#haitian-police-patrol-the-streets-in-portauprince-on-february-9-2015-picture-id463084818|title=Haitian Police patrol the streets in Port-au-Prince, on February 9, 2015 during a strike convened by the transport unions and political opposition parties, against the high price of fuel|publisher=}}</ref>\n*[[Fiat Siena]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/seo2/212535611|title=Wayback Machine|website=web-beta.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n==Weapons==\n* [[IMI Galil]]\n* [[R4 assault rifle]]\n* [[M16 rifle]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch G3]]\n* [[FN MAG]]\n* [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]]\n* [[T65 assault rifle]]\n* [[M1911 pistol]]\n* [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]\n* [[Uzi]]\n* [[M60 machine gun]]\n* [[M4 carbine]]\n* [[Benelli M4]]\n* [[M14 rifle]]\n\n==Haitian Police Academy==\nAt the Police Academy, it is important to modernize the curriculum and management training programs, and to strengthen the capacity of Haitian management. In Haiti, the pressing need for police personnel had helped train more than 5,000 police officers in six months as part of a training program administered mainly by international donors. The Haitian Police Academy is under the control of the Police Nationale d'Haiti, which appoints the director with the approval of the Supreme Council of the National Police (CSPN).\n\nFormed in 1994, the Academy hosted its first director in May 1995, and was to transfer responsibility for the training of national police from 1998 under the supervision of instructors Haitians instead of foreign instructors ICITAP. In 2006, the presence of a large contingent of foreign police within the mission of the MINUTAH and UN civilian police, is an opportunity for capacity building Haitian, development of curriculum, the 'teaching and administration of the National Police Academy. The specific objectives of reform include:\n\n* Strengthening the basic training curriculum to a standard equivalent to the best standards and practices;\n* Increased international cooperation in matters of curriculum development for basic training, and teaching practice;\n* The overhaul of the structure and administrative practices of the National Academy of Police, to parity with international institutions like best.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Haiti}}\n* [[Law enforcement in Haiti]]\n\n==References==\n{{Loc}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Adrian J English, Armed Forces of Latin America\n\n==External links==\n* [http://pnh.ht Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090222/http://www.embassymag.ca/page/view/haiti-12-17-2008 Canadian Embassy article]\n* [http://www.fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/lainven.html FAS weapons invantory]\n{{Commons category|Police of Haiti}}\n{{Police}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Haiti|National Police]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement agencies of Haiti|National Police]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1995]]\n[[Category:National police forces]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=March 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2018}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=March 2018}}\n}}\n{{Infobox Law enforcement agency\n| agencyname        = Haitian National Police\n| nativename        = {{lang|fr|Police nationale d'Ha\u00efti}}\n| nativenamea       = \n| nativenamer       = \n| commonname        = Police nationale\n| abbreviation      = PNH\n| patch             = \n| patchcaption      = \n| logo              = \n| logocaption       = \n| badge             = \n| badgecaption      = \n| flag              = \n| flagcaption       = \n| motto             = ''Proteger et Servir''\n| mottotranslated   = Protect and Serve\n| mission           = \n| formedyear        = 1995<br/>1912 <small>(original)</small>\n| formedmonthday    = June 12 \n| preceding1        = \n| employees         = 16,569 (2018){{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n| volunteers        = \n| budget            = \n| nongovernment     = \n| country           = Haiti \n| countryabbr       = \n| national          = Yes\n| map               = \n| mapcaption        = \n| sizearea          = 27,750 km\u00b2\n| sizepopulation    = 10.9 million \n| legaljuris        = \n| governingbody     = Cabinet of Haiti\n| governingbodyscnd = \n| constitution1     = \n| police            = Yes\n| local             = Yes\n| overviewtype      = \n| overviewbody      = \n| headquarters      = [[Port-au-Prince]],  [[Haiti]]\n| hqlocmap          = \n| hqlocleft         = \n| hqloctop          = \n| hqlocmappoptitle  = \n| sworntype         = \n| sworn             = \n| unsworntype       = \n| unsworn           = \n| electeetype       = Minister\n| minister1name     = Ariel Henry\n| minister1pfo      = [[Ministry of Interior and Territorial Communities (Haiti)|Ministry of Interior Territorial Communities]]\n| chief1name        = \n| chief1position    = \n| parentagency      = \n| child1agency      = \n| unittype          = \n| unitname          = \n| officetype        = \n| officename        = \n| provideragency    = \n| uniformedas       = \n| stationtype       = \n| stations          = \n| airbases          = \n| lockuptype        = \n| lockups           = \n| vehicle1type      = Cars\n| vehicles1         = Fiat Siena, Dodge Ram, Nissan Frontier, Lenco Bearcat\n| boat1type         = \n| boats1            = \n| aircraft1type     = \n| aircraft1         = \n| animal1type       = \n| animals1          = \n| person1name       = \n| person1reason     = \n| person1type       = \n| programme1        = \n| activity1name     = \n| activitytype      = \n| anniversary1      = \n| award1            = \n| website           = {{Official website|http://www.pnh.ht}} {{in lang|fr}}\n| footnotes         = \n| reference         = \n}}\n[[File:Inauguration of Jovenel Moise 04.jpg|thumb|A Haitian police canine handler at the presidential inauguration in 2017.]]\n[[File:USMC and HNP SWAT.JPEG|thumb|300px|A member of the Haitian National Police Special Weapons And Tactics team (right) and a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] (left) search an apartment complex in [[Port-au-Prince]] in 2004.]]\nThe '''Haitian National Police''' ('''PNH'''; {{lang-fr|Police Nationale d\u2019Ha\u00efti}}, literally \"National Police of Haiti\"), is the law enforcement and ''de facto'' police force of [[Haiti]].

More than 8,500 police officers have completed training in modern law enforcement.\n\nThe police force has divided itself into different divisions to tackle the many problems facing Haiti. Many of these divisions are specialised to address particular chronic crimes that affect the nation including kidnapping, drugs, and gangs.

Since 1987, successive governments attempted to reform it as stated by the constitution it was created to maintain peace, enforce law and order in accordance with the rule of law, to protect its citizens and to arrest those that violate the law. However the police, being plagued by militarism, factionalism, and corruption, is mainly viewed by citizens as being repressive.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution proposed the establishment of a separate police corps and a new police academy under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. Political developments in Haiti since 1987, however, have precluded implementation of these changes. Nevertheless, the mission of the police corps was almost indistinguishable from the mission spelled out for the [[Armed Forces of Haiti|FAd'H]]. The characterization of the police as a ''corps arm\u00e9e'' (armed corps) reinforced this similarity in missions.\n\nThe only identifiable police force in Haiti operated in Port-au-Prince as part of the armed forces. This 1,000-member force had few operational or technical capabilities, even though it was responsible for narcotics and immigration control and criminal investigations. In the late 1980s, the Narcotics Bureau, commanded by an army major, had acquired some visibility and resources of its own, with a reported staff of about twenty-five people.\n\nThere was no true rural police. Small garrisons, operating under military department command, with some cooperation from the lowest central government administrative head, section chief (chef de section), were responsible for rural security. In effect, the heads of these 562 rural communal sections (sections rurales communales) functioned as police chiefs, as adjuncts of the nation's military infrastructure. This fusion of civil and military administration continued to be possible because of the broad range of responsibilities assigned to the Ministry of Interior and National Defense.\n\nAfter 1986 the armed forces failed to reestablish a nationwide police force and to subdue the [[Tonton Macoute|MVSN]] and other [[vigilante group]]s. Some observers have argued that links between the senior army command and remnants of the MVSN have paralyzed reforms in Haiti's judicial system. An illustration of their point was the reported incorporation of some MVSN personnel into FAd'H units and some members of the VSN, as plainclothes paramilitary agents, in the Dessalines Battalion. Other MVSN members found their way into cadres of the Port-au-Prince police force, particularly in the Criminal Investigation Unit (Recheraches Criminelles\u2014renamed in 1988 the Anti-Gang Investigations Bureau), which was traditionally based at the Dessalines barracks. The demise of the Dessalines Battalion and the Leopards, the latter of which had served as Haiti's special weapons and tactics unit, raised questions in the spring of 1989 about the future of a national police force.\n\nThe Avril government reported some success in cracking down on abuses within the security services, but violence continued to be a serious problem. Insecurity rose dramatically after 1986 with the formation of ad hoc paramilitary groups that had direct links to the VSN and indirect links to the military. Many of these paramilitary groups engaged in banditry with no political motivation. The security situation in rural regions and at the section chief level remained unclear in 1989.\n\nThe human-rights record of post-Duvalier governments was generally negative. A major problem was the inability, or the unwillingness, of the FAd'H to contain domestic political violence. Government and military personnel apparently sanctioned and participated in attacks on politicians and other activists, particularly during the second Namphy government. The Avril government boasted an improved record in this area, but as of mid-1989, it had proved incapable of restoring order.\n\nHaitian military and police often brutally interrogated detainees. Rural section chiefs, who wielded considerable power within their limited jurisdictions, arbitrarily harassed and physically abused citizens, according to some reports. In an effort to address this problem, Avril dismissed a number of section chiefs, and issued a decree in December 1988 that ended appointments of section chiefs and proposed putting the posts up for election (see Urban Dominance, Rural Stagnation, ch. 9).\n\nHarsh conditions prevailed in the prison system. Hygiene, food, and health care were inadequate, and prison staff regularly mistreated inmates. The Avril government closed two facilities closely associated with the repression of the Duvalier regimes\u2014 [[Fort Dimanche]] and the detention center of the Criminal Investigation Unit, both in Port-au-Prince\u2014because of the abuses that had commonly taken place there.\n\nPolitical turmoil between 1986 and 1989 resulted in popular justice and mob violence. The international media reported on some of this violence and featured scenes of burning or dismembered bodies. Continued human-rights violations are likely to attract international criticism during the 1990s. Lasting improvements in internal security, however, appeared unlikely without the establishment of functional civilian institutions and some resolution of the status of the former members of the tonton makouts. \n \nIn 1995, Haiti disbanded its military, which formerly provided police services in rural areas and operated the Port-au-Prince Police.\n\nDuring President Aristide\u2019s second term (2000\u221204) political appointees took over many key positions in the PNH. In many instances, these appointees lacked security experience and compromised the political neutrality of the force. After Aristide fled the country, the interim president removed 200 corrupt and inexperienced officers in an effort to improve the PNH\u2019s effectiveness. New training ensued to teach police officers how to balance security and human rights concerns. However, numerous problems limit the PNH\u2019s effectiveness and reliability. Former military personnel exert considerable influence within the police force, and some have begun to push for the reestablishment of the Haitian army.\n\nSince its inception, the PNH has suffered from mismanagement, corruption, and a lack of funding. MINUSTAH has helped make up for the shortfalls of the PNH since it arrived in Haiti in 2004. Many security operations have been undertaken jointly by the PNH and MINUSTAH. Nevertheless, rampant crime and gang violence continue to be the most immediate problem facing Haitian authorities.<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf|title=About this Collection - Country Studies|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==General Organization==\nThe PNH is currently headed by the Director General ([[chief of police]]) Michel-Ange Gedeon appointed by president Privert to a three-year term.\n\nAlthough officially part of the police force, the Presidential Security Unit operates with its own budget and administration.<ref name=\"loc.gov\"/>\n\n===National Organization===\nThe National organization of the PNH is as follows:\n\n* Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Police Nationale d\u2019Haiti or DGPNH (General Directorate of the National Police of Haiti)\n* Inspection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Police Nationale d\u2019Haiti or IGPNH  (Inspector General of the National Police of Haiti)\n* Direction des Renseignements G\u00e9n\u00e9raux or DRG (Direction of the General Information)\n* Cabinet Du directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Police Nationale d\u2019Haiti - CAB ( Cabinet of the Director General of the National Police of Haiti)\n* Direction du D\u00e9veloppement Ou Commissariat au Plan or DDCP (Direction of the Development or Planning Commission)\n\n==Centrally controlled organizations==\n\n===General and Administrative Services===\nDirection Centrale de l\u2019Administration et des Services G\u00e9n\u00e9raux or DCASG (Central Directorate of the Administration and General Services) is responsible for human resources, the finances, and logistics needs of the National Police of Haiti It includes the following components:<ref name=\"156.29\">{{Cite web |url=http://67.227.156.29/~pnh//dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=8 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121183221/http://67.227.156.29/~pnh/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=8 |archive-date=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n# La Direction des Finances et de la Comptabilit\u00e9 (DFC) - The Directorate of Finance and Accounting\n# La Direction du Personnel (DP) - The Directorate of Personnel\n# La Direction de la Logistique (DL) - The Directorate of Logistics\n# La Direction des Ecoles et de la Formation Permanente (DEFP) - The Directorate of Schools and Continuing Education\n# L'Administration P\u00e9nitentiaire Nationale (APENA) The National Penitentiary Administration\n\n===Administrative Police===\nDirection Centrale de la Police Administratrive or DCPA (Central Directorate of the Administrative Police force) Under Article 28 of the Act establishing and organizing the National Police, the Central Directorate of Administrative Police (DCPA) is the body responsible for designing and implementing measures to safeguard the peace, tranquility and good public order.

In addition, attention to executive reward Haitian militancy of its supporters by awarding positions in public administration, including the PNH, had greatly influenced the recruitment of new Haitian officers.\n\nThe personal allegiance required of new graduates of the academy and the police school by the Head of State made training and effective monitoring of the members of the police force difficult. This resulted in a officer cadre whose training and ethics are inadequate, and that a significant fraction is related to human rights abuses, drug trafficking, illicit enrichment, and most vicious crimes, including the latest fashion is to say the kidnapping of peaceful and honest citizens, as well as their wives and their children.\n\nIn recruiting members, including the transfer or promotion of any member to a new assignment, the PNH will:\n\n* Using the constitutional provisions, laws of the Republic and its internal rules to reject any interference from political authorities in the efficient functioning of the police institution, especially as regards the management of its human resources;\n* Using modern means of communication, including media, to inform the population, in the most comprehensive and transparent on its recruitment goals and general employment opportunities, in order to equalize the chances of participation of any individual qualified;\n* Strengthen the process of selection of all candidates for a career in the police institution, both pre-requisite personnel, supporting documentation required, as written examinations, medical, physical and psychological, including a further verification of the personal history of candidates, particularly in relation to their performance in previous jobs, general crime, abuse of human rights and domestic violence;\n* Apply a uniform and consistent testing, standards and regulations relating to recruitment;\n* Train managers and other employees of the institution to an efficient, impartial and professional staff recruitment;\n* Seek foreign assistance, as needed, to strengthen the management capacity of the recruitment process, particularly as related to verification of the candidate's personal history, skills and psychological profile of candidates.\n\n==Vehicles==\n*[[Ram Pickup|Dodge Ram]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashhaiti.com/ads-library/Inspection+Generale+de+La+Police+National+d'Haiti+(PNH)/pnh-ad53.jpg|title=Wayback Machine|website=web-beta.archive.org}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n*[[Lenco BearCat|Lenco Bearcat]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashhaiti.com/ads-library/Inspection+Generale+de+La+Police+National+d'Haiti+(PNH)/pnh-ad51.jpg|title=Wayback Machine|website=web-beta.archive.org}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n*[[Nissan Navara|Nissan Frontier]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/haitian-police-patrol-the-streets-in-port-au-prince-on-news-photo/463084818?esource=SEO_GIS_CDN_Redirect#haitian-police-patrol-the-streets-in-portauprince-on-february-9-2015-picture-id463084818|title=Haitian Police patrol the streets in Port-au-Prince, on February 9, 2015 during a strike convened by the transport unions and political opposition parties, against the high price of fuel|publisher=}}</ref>\n*[[Fiat Siena]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/seo2/212535611|title=Wayback Machine|website=web-beta.archive.org}}</ref>\n\n==Weapons==\n* [[IMI Galil]]\n* [[R4 assault rifle]]\n* [[M16 rifle]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch G3]]\n* [[FN MAG]]\n* [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]]\n* [[T65 assault rifle]]\n* [[M1911 pistol]]\n* [[M1919 Browning machine gun]]\n* [[Uzi]]\n* [[M60 machine gun]]\n* [[M4 carbine]]\n* [[Benelli M4]]\n* [[M14 rifle]]\n\n==Haitian Police Academy==\nAt the Police Academy, it is important to modernize the curriculum and management training programs, and to strengthen the capacity of Haitian management. In Haiti, the pressing need for police personnel had helped train more than 5,000 police officers in six months as part of a training program administered mainly by international donors. The Haitian Police Academy is under the control of the Police Nationale d'Haiti, which appoints the director with the approval of the Supreme Council of the National Police (CSPN).\n\nFormed in 1994, the Academy hosted its first director in May 1995, and was to transfer responsibility for the training of national police from 1998 under the supervision of instructors Haitians instead of foreign instructors ICITAP. In 2006, the presence of a large contingent of foreign police within the mission of the MINUTAH and UN civilian police, is an opportunity for capacity building Haitian, development of curriculum, the 'teaching and administration of the National Police Academy. The specific objectives of reform include:\n\n* Strengthening the basic training curriculum to a standard equivalent to the best standards and practices;\n* Increased international cooperation in matters of curriculum development for basic training, and teaching practice;\n* The overhaul of the structure and administrative practices of the National Academy of Police, to parity with international institutions like best.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Haiti}}\n* [[Law enforcement in Haiti]]\n\n==References==\n{{Loc}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Adrian J English, Armed Forces of Latin America\n\n==External links==\n* [http://pnh.ht Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110105090222/http://www.embassymag.ca/page/view/haiti-12-17-2008 Canadian Embassy article]\n* [http://www.fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/lainven.html FAS weapons invantory]\n{{Commons category|Police of Haiti}}\n{{Police}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Haiti|National Police]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement agencies of Haiti|National Police]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1995]]\n[[Category:National police forces]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: a officer \u2192  an officer,typo(s) fixed: five year \u2192 five-year, \u2019s \u2192 's (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_National_Police"}
