It lies between Golden Ball Hill, to the east, and Walker Hill, to the west.  At the top of the hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]], a form of [[Neolithic]] earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.  It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind.  Knap Hill is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified, and has been scheduled as an [[ancient monument]].\n\n[[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin]] and [[Maud Cunnington]] spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud published two reports of their work, noting that there were several gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  At first they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by [[Graham Connah]], who kept excellent stratigraphic documentation. In 2011 the Gathering Time project published an analysis of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\nTwo barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.  Knap Hill is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile (1.6 km) to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond Adam's Grave.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al. (2001), pp. 156\u2013157.</ref> a form of earthwork which began to appear in England in the early [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]], from about 3700 BC.<ref>Oswald et al. (2001), p. 3.</ref>  (Both the causewayed enclosure and the hill itself are referred to as Knap Hill.)  Causewayed enclosures are characterized by a full or partial enclosure of an area with segmented ditches (that is, ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground), often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.<ref name=\":3\" />  The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate, and many suggestions have been made by researchers.  They may have seen use as settlements\u2014early investigators suggested that the inhabitants lived in the ditches, but this idea was later abandoned in favour of any settlement being within the enclosure boundaries.<ref name=\":7\">Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), p. 5.</ref>  In a 1912 report on an excavation at Knap Hill it was assumed that the ramparts were a form of defence.<ref name=\":6\">Cunnington (1912), p.48.</ref> The causeways were difficult to explain in military terms, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force;<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Curwen (1930), p. 50.</ref> evidence of attacks at some sites provided support for the idea that the enclosures were fortified settlements.<ref name=\":7\" /> They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery, and if they were a focus for the local people, they may have been evidence of a local hierarchy with a tribal chief.  There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, [[Cecil Curwen]] identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al. (2001), p. 25.</ref> Excavations at five of these had already confirmed them as Neolithic, and another four of Curwen's sites are now agreed to be Neolithic. <ref name=\":8\" />  A few more were found over the succeeding decades,<ref name=\":9\">Oswald et al.

Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep and {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones.

The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner (marked S\u2013S on the plan).<ref name=\":20\">Cunnington (1912), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>  Most of the relics obtained from the ditches were found in clusters, and were usually within a foot (30 cm) of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone.

Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; the Cunningtons cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=2|Anglo-Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons<ref name=\":22\" />]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep, and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|4|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref name=\":19\"/>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill 1908-9 excavation section A.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908\u20131909 excavation.<ref name=\":21\" />]]\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), {{convert|23|by|13.5|ft|abbr=on}}, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The northwestern bank led for {{convert|50|yd|m|spell=in}} towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches (i through iii) and the excavated area (iv) from the 1961 excavation<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found;<ref name=\":23\">Connah (1965), p. 12\u201314.</ref> they were not associated with the earliest strata, and Connah suggested they may have come from visits to the hill top, rather than an occupation.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 22.</ref>  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments were found in the upper layers of the cuttings, all of which may have originally been part of a single vessel. These sherds could not be accurately dated.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall.  She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \"iv\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.

It lies between Golden Ball Hill, to the east, and Walker Hill, to the west.  At the top of the hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]], a form of [[Neolithic]] earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.  It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind.  Knap Hill is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified, and has been scheduled as an [[ancient monument]].\n\n[[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin]] and [[Maud Cunnington]] spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud published two reports of their work, noting that there were several gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  At first they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by [[Graham Connah]], who kept excellent stratigraphic documentation. In 2011 the Gathering Time project published an analysis of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\nTwo barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.  Knap Hill is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile (1.6 km) to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond Adam's Grave.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

(2001), p. 3.</ref>  (Both the causewayed enclosure and the hill itself are referred to as Knap Hill.)  Causewayed enclosures are characterized by a full or partial enclosure of an area with segmented ditches (that is, ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground), often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.<ref name=\":3\" />  The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate, and many suggestions have been made by researchers.

There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, [[Cecil Curwen]] identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep and {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones.

The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep, and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|4|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref name=\":19\"/>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill 1908-9 excavation section A.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908\u20131909 excavation.<ref name=\":21\" />]]\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), {{convert|23|by|13.5|ft|abbr=on}}, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The northwestern bank led for {{convert|50|yd|m|spell=in}} towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches (i through iii) and the excavated area (iv) from the 1961 excavation<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found;<ref name=\":23\">Connah (1965), p. 12\u201314.</ref> they were not associated with the earliest strata, and Connah suggested they may have come from visits to the hill top, rather than an occupation.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 22.</ref>  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments were found in the upper layers of the cuttings, all of which may have originally been part of a single vessel. These sherds could not be accurately dated.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall.  She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \"iv\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good [[Glossary of archaeology|association]] with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795-812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304\u2013305|via=|issue=172|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42-65|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin B{{sub|12}} there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.

The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability (except in rare cases<ref name=Thauvin/>) to convert any form of B<sub>12</sub> to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms.

Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food additives and in many common multivitamins. \n\n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. These are converted to the other methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over the other two forms except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

Enzymes in this class have not been identified in humans.\n\nIn humans, two major coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme families corresponding to the first two reaction types, are known. These are typified by the following two enzymes:\n\n# [[Methylmalonyl Coenzyme A mutase|MUT]] is an isomerase which uses the AdoB<sub>12</sub> form and reaction type 1 to catalyze a carbon skeleton rearrangement (the X group is -COSCoA). MUT's reaction converts [[L-methylmalonyl-CoA|MMl-CoA]] to [[succinyl-CoA|Su-CoA]], an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], and can be measured clinically as an increased [[methylmalonic acid]] (MMA) level. Unfortunately, an elevated MMA is a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive but not specific test]], and not all who have it actually have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For this reason, assessment of MMA levels is not routinely recommended in the elderly. There is no \"gold standard\" test for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency because as a B<sub>12</sub> deficiency occurs, serum values may be maintained while tissue B<sub>12</sub> stores become depleted. Therefore, serum B<sub>12</sub> values above the cut-off point of deficiency do not necessarily indicate adequate B<sub>12</sub> status. The MUT function is necessary for proper [[myelin]] synthesis and is not affected by folate supplementation.\n# [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]], also known as methionine synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB<sub>12</sub> and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] to [[homocysteine]], thereby generating [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) and [[methionine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee RV, Matthews RG | title = Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 1450\u20139 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2407589 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.4.5.2407589 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72f397b529d457977a9e949dbfb325eebe124590 }}</ref> This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], resulting in an increased [[homocysteine]] level and the trapping of [[folate]] as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]].

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

The [[hydrogenase]]s and, by necessity, enzymes associated with cobalt utilization, involve metal-carbon bonds.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bioorganometallics: Biomolecules, Labeling, Medicine | veditors = Jaouen G | url = https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Bioorganometallics%3A+Biomolecules%2C+Labeling%2C+Medicine-p-9783527309900 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-527-30990-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is a generic descriptor name referring to a collection of [[cobalt]] and [[corrin ring]] molecules, which are defined by their particular vitamin function in the body. All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability (except in rare cases<ref name=Thauvin/>) to convert any form of B<sub>12</sub> to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms.

Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food additives and in many common multivitamins. \n\n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. These are converted to the other methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over the other two forms except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

Enzymes in this class have not been identified in humans.\n\nIn humans, two major coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme families corresponding to the first two reaction types, are known. These are typified by the following two enzymes:\n\n# [[Methylmalonyl Coenzyme A mutase|MUT]] is an isomerase which uses the AdoB<sub>12</sub> form and reaction type 1 to catalyze a carbon skeleton rearrangement (the X group is -COSCoA). MUT's reaction converts [[L-methylmalonyl-CoA|MMl-CoA]] to [[succinyl-CoA|Su-CoA]], an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], and can be measured clinically as an increased [[methylmalonic acid]] (MMA) level. Unfortunately, an elevated MMA is a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive but not specific test]], and not all who have it actually have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. For this reason, assessment of MMA levels is not routinely recommended in the elderly. There is no \"gold standard\" test for B<sub>12</sub> deficiency because as a B<sub>12</sub> deficiency occurs, serum values may be maintained while tissue B<sub>12</sub> stores become depleted. Therefore, serum B<sub>12</sub> values above the cut-off point of deficiency do not necessarily indicate adequate B<sub>12</sub> status. The MUT function is necessary for proper [[myelin]] synthesis and is not affected by folate supplementation.\n# [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]], also known as methionine synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB<sub>12</sub> and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] to [[homocysteine]], thereby generating [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) and [[methionine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee RV, Matthews RG | title = Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 1450\u20139 | date = March 1990 | pmid = 2407589 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.4.5.2407589 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72f397b529d457977a9e949dbfb325eebe124590 }}</ref> This functionality is lost in [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency]], resulting in an increased [[homocysteine]] level and the trapping of [[folate]] as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine.

Before the game, Martin and other members of the Yankees had noticed the amount of [[pine tar]] used by Brett, but Martin had chosen not to say anything until it was strategically useful to do so.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/67 |title=Pine tar nullifies home run, so Brett goes ballistic |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>  Yankees third baseman [[Graig Nettles]] recalled a similar incident involving [[Thurman Munson]] in a {{By|1975}} game against the [[1975 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1975/B07190MIN1975.htm|title=Retrosheet Boxscore: Minnesota Twins 2, New York Yankees 1|accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> In Nettles' autobiography ''Balls'', Nettles claims that he actually informed Martin of the pine tar rule, as Nettles had previously undergone the same scrutiny with his own bat while with the Twins.\n\nWith Brett watching from the dugout, McClelland and the rest of the umpiring crew, [[Drew Coble]], [[Joe Brinkman]], and [[Nick Bremigan]], inspected the bat. Measuring the bat against the width of [[home plate]] (which is {{convert|17|in|cm|disp=or||}} wide), they determined that the amount of [[pine tar]] on the bat's handle exceeded that allowed by Rule 1.10(c) of the Major League Baseball rule book, which read that \"a bat may not be covered by such a substance more than {{convert|18|in|disp=sqbr|cm||}} from the tip of the handle.\" At the time, such a hit was defined in the rules as \"an illegally batted ball,\" and under the terms of the then-existing provisions of Rule 6.06, any batter who hit an illegally batted ball was automatically called out. The umpires concluded that under this interpretation, Brett's home run was disallowed, and he was out, thus ending the game.\n\nMcClelland searched for Brett in the visitors' dugout, pointed at him with the bat, and signaled that he was out, handing the Yankees a 4\u20133 win. An enraged Brett ran out of the dugout and confronted McClelland, requiring him to be physically restrained by his manager [[Dick Howser]], several of his teammates, and umpire Joe Brinkman. (As one commentator noted, \"Brett had the ignominious distinction of hitting a game-''losing'' home run.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=McKenzie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyX1-UG7hQwC&lpg=PA77&dq=brett%20%22a%20game-losing%20home%20run%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Umpires' Ruling Beats the Tar Out of Royals |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=July 25, 1983\n|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>) Despite the furious protests of Brett and Howser, McClelland's ruling stood.\n\n==Protest and reversal==\n[[File:Lee MacPhail 2004.jpg|thumb|right|American League president [[Lee MacPhail]] ruled that Brett's home run counted.]]\nThe Royals protested the game. Four days later, [[American League]] president [[Lee MacPhail]] upheld the Royals' protest. In explaining his decision, MacPhail noted that the \"spirit of the restriction\" on pine tar on bats was based not on the fear of unfair advantage, but simple economics; any contact with pine tar would discolor the ball, render it unsuitable for play, and require that it be discarded and replaced\u2014thus increasing the home team's cost of supplying balls for a given game. MacPhail ruled that Brett had not violated the spirit of the rules nor deliberately \"altered [the bat] to improve the distance factor\".\n\nMacPhail's ruling followed precedent established after a protest in 1975 of the September 7 game played between the Royals and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |title=The pine tar games from |publisher=The Hardball Times |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203005623/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |archivedate=February 3, 2013 }}</ref>  In that game, the umpiring crew had declined to negate one of [[John Mayberry]]'s home runs for excessive pine tar use. MacPhail, who also heard this protest, upheld the umpires' decision with the view that the intent of the rule was to prevent baseballs from being discolored during game play and that any discoloration that may have occurred to a ball leaving the ballpark did not affect the game's competitive balance.\n\nMacPhail thus restored Brett's home run and ordered the game resumed with two outs in the top of the ninth inning with the Royals leading 5\u20134. Although MacPhail ruled that Brett's home run counted, he retroactively [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] Brett for his outburst against McClelland.

Measuring the bat against the width of [[home plate]] (which is {{convert|17|in|cm|disp=or||}} wide), they determined that the amount of [[pine tar]] on the bat's handle exceeded that allowed by Rule 1.10(c) of the Major League Baseball rule book, which read that \"a bat may not be covered by such a substance more than {{convert|18|in|disp=sqbr|cm||}} from the tip of the handle.\" At the time, such a hit was defined in the rules as \"an illegally batted ball,\" and under the terms of the then-existing provisions of Rule 6.06, any batter who hit an illegally batted ball was automatically called out. The umpires concluded that under this interpretation, Brett's home run was disallowed, and he was out, thus ending the game.\n\nMcClelland searched for Brett in the visitors' dugout, pointed at him with the bat, and signaled that he was out, handing the Yankees a 4\u20133 win. An enraged Brett ran out of the dugout and confronted McClelland, requiring him to be physically restrained by his manager [[Dick Howser]], several of his teammates, and umpire Joe Brinkman. (As one commentator noted, \"Brett had the ignominious distinction of hitting a game-''losing'' home run.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=McKenzie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyX1-UG7hQwC&lpg=PA77&dq=brett%20%22a%20game-losing%20home%20run%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Umpires' Ruling Beats the Tar Out of Royals |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=July 25, 1983\n|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>) Despite the furious protests of Brett and Howser, McClelland's ruling stood.\n\n==Protest and reversal==\n[[File:Lee MacPhail 2004.jpg|thumb|right|American League president [[Lee MacPhail]] ruled that Brett's home run counted.]]\nThe Royals protested the game. Four days later, [[American League]] president [[Lee MacPhail]] upheld the Royals' protest. In explaining his decision, MacPhail noted that the \"spirit of the restriction\" on pine tar on bats was based not on the fear of unfair advantage, but simple economics; any contact with pine tar would discolor the ball, render it unsuitable for play, and require that it be discarded and replaced\u2014thus increasing the home team's cost of supplying balls for a given game. MacPhail ruled that Brett had not violated the spirit of the rules nor deliberately \"altered [the bat] to improve the distance factor\".\n\nMacPhail's ruling followed precedent established after a protest in 1975 of the September 7 game played between the Royals and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |title=The pine tar games from |publisher=The Hardball Times |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203005623/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |archivedate=February 3, 2013 }}</ref>  In that game, the umpiring crew had declined to negate one of [[John Mayberry]]'s home runs for excessive pine tar use. MacPhail, who also heard this protest, upheld the umpires' decision with the view that the intent of the rule was to prevent baseballs from being discolored during game play and that any discoloration that may have occurred to a ball leaving the ballpark did not affect the game's competitive balance.\n\nMacPhail thus restored Brett's home run and ordered the game resumed with two outs in the top of the ninth inning with the Royals leading 5\u20134. Although MacPhail ruled that Brett's home run counted, he retroactively [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] Brett for his outburst against McClelland. He also ejected Howser and coach [[Rocky Colavito]] for arguing with the umpires, and Royals pitcher [[Gaylord Perry]] for giving the bat to the bat boy so he could hide it in the clubhouse.\n\n==Conclusion==\n===Strategic maneuvering===\nThe Yankees resisted the resumption of the game, and waited until near the end of the season to agree to it, to see if the game would have an effect on the standings or should be forfeited.<ref name=Pittsburgh>{{cite news |title=Yankees, Royals, courts put an end to Tar Wars |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v6lRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pm0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=orest-maresca%20joseph-sullivan&pg=7082%2C4514160 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 19, 1983 |page=13 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter ordering the resumption of gameplay, MacPhail and other league officials held a strategy session to anticipate tricks the Yankees might use to prevent the game from continuing.<ref name=Norwalk>{{cite news |title=MacPhail's Folly |first=Dick |last=Young |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nDRJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tQYNAAAAIBAJ&dq=bob-fishel%20affidavit%20martin&pg=2117%2C3226978 |newspaper=The Hour |location=Norwalk, Conn. |date=August 22, 1983 |page=17 |quote=After MacPhail ordered the Yanks and KC to play the last of the ninth inning, Lee and Bob Fishel and others in the league office held a meeting to discuss counter-strategy.

Luciano, a young fishmonger married with children who lives in Naples, is attracted to this show that is famous in Italy.  The program is superficial and silly but well-liked by the public, especially Luciano, the protagonist of the film.  After a festive and vulgar marriage between relatives, Luciano returns to his poor life selling fish in the city.  Luciano's friends, who are ignorant and dishonest, decide to persuade Luciano to audition for a part as one of the boys in Big Brother.  Naively, Luciano is convinced and decides to go to Cinecitt\u00e0 in Rome to audition.  At the audition the committee finds Luciano pleasant, though insignificant, and the assistant director dismisses him, saying he will be contacted if selected for the program. However, when Luciano returns to his neighborhood in Naples, he begins going crazy while waiting to hear from the assistant director. He believes he is being watched by hidden cameras from the television program he loves so much and is really happy about them.  Luciano believes that appearing generous will win him the part on Big Brother, so he begins to give small gifts to the poor of the city, then spends large amounts of money giving away more expensive items, such as furniture, from his house. His wife and other relatives despair and believe that Luciano is out of his mind. His wife is especially worried and bursts into tears when she meets a friend of Luciano. She asks him why her husband has become so strange and, although he feels a deep sorrow for Luciano's tearful wife, he does not know how to answer. Luciano continues to get worse and is seen laughing for no reason.  Finally, he makes a pilgrimage to Rome, and becomes obsessed with studying for his part in Big Brother, which is now his only reason for living.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aniello Arena]] as Luciano\n* [[Loredana Simioli]] as Maria\n* [[Claudia Gerini]] as Grande Fratello\n* [[Paola Minaccioni]] as Roman woman\n* [[Ciro Petrone]] as barista\n* [[Nunzia Schiano]] as Aunt Nunzia\n* [[Nando Paone]] as Michele\n* [[Arturo Gambardella]] as policeman\n* [[Angelica Borghese]]\n\n==Production==\nAfter winning acclaim with his 2008 crime film ''[[Gomorrah (film)|Gomorrah]]'', director [[Matteo Garrone]] wanted a key change for his next project, and decided to make a comedy.

Luciano, a young fishmonger married with children who lives in Naples, is attracted to this show that is famous in Italy.  The program is superficial and silly but well-liked by the public, especially Luciano, the protagonist of the film.  After a festive and vulgar marriage between relatives, Luciano returns to his poor life selling fish in the city.  Luciano's friends, who are ignorant and dishonest, decide to persuade Luciano to audition for a part as one of the boys in Big Brother.  Naively, Luciano is convinced and decides to go to Cinecitt\u00e0 in Rome to audition.  At the audition the committee finds Luciano pleasant, though insignificant, and the assistant director dismisses him, saying he will be contacted if selected for the program. However, when Luciano returns to his neighborhood in Naples, he begins going crazy while waiting to hear from the assistant director. He believes he is being watched by hidden cameras from the television program he loves so much and is really happy about them.  Luciano believes that appearing generous will win him the part on Big Brother, so he begins to give small gifts to the poor of the city, then spends large amounts of money giving away more expensive items, such as furniture, from his house. His wife and other relatives despair and believe that Luciano is out of his mind. His wife is especially worried and bursts into tears when she meets a friend of Luciano. She asks him why her husband has become so strange and, although he feels a deep sorrow for Luciano's tearful wife, he does not know how to answer. Luciano continues to get worse and is seen laughing for no reason.  Finally, he makes a pilgrimage to Rome, and becomes obsessed with studying for his part in Big Brother, which is now his only reason for living.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aniello Arena]] as Luciano\n* [[Loredana Simioli]] as Maria\n* [[Claudia Gerini]] as Grande Fratello\n* [[Paola Minaccioni]] as Roman woman\n* [[Ciro Petrone]] as barista\n* [[Nunzia Schiano]] as Aunt Nunzia\n* [[Nando Paone]] as Michele\n* [[Arturo Gambardella]] as policeman\n* [[Angelica Borghese]]\n\n==Production==\nAfter winning acclaim with his 2008 crime film ''[[Gomorrah (film)|Gomorrah]]'', director [[Matteo Garrone]] wanted a key change for his next project, and decided to make a comedy. The screenplay for ''Reality'' is based on a true story. Garrone describes it as \"a simple, working-class tale\", not intended as a political treatise. However, it did develop into a darker film than originally planned, and Garrone has expressed doubt as to whether the finished version can be described as a comedy.<ref name=ansa>{{cite web|author=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|date=19 April 2012|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/news/en/151772|title=Garrone bids for more Cannes success|work=Life in Italy|accessdate=10 May 2012<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/news/en/151772 -->}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced by Fandango and the director's company Archimede.
