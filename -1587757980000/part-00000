When told by Dan about the report of [[Seattle Mariners]] player [[Ichiro Suzuki]] signing a 5-year, $100 million contract, Samson was in a state of disbelief. He went on to say that no player in baseball was worthy of that amount and that this deal would surely return the league to the days of ridiculous contracts, surely ruining the sport.\n\nThe next day, [[Bob Ryan]] of the ''Boston Globe'' appeared on the show to share opinion on the matter. He began by asking if Samson had just entered baseball yesterday. He then went on to criticize both Samson and the Florida Marlins franchise, while calling the deal as one of a well-managed franchise.<ref name=\"Samson\">''790 the Ticket''  [http://www.790theticket.com/audio/1267492097David%20Samson%20Show-%207-11-07.mp3 David Samson's interview on July 11th] Updated 2007-07-11, retrieved 2007-07-12</ref><ref name=\"Bob Ryan\">''790 the Ticket'' [http://www.790theticket.com/audio/1260416199Bob%20Ryan%20Interview-%207-12-07.mp3 Bob Ryan's response to Samson's remarks] Updated 2007-07-12, retrieved 2007-07-12</ref>\n\n=== Jay Bilas racial questions ===\n[[ESPN]] college basketball analyst [[Jay Bilas]] was on the show on April 7, 2008 to discuss NBA Draft prospects. When Le Batard asked if race was a factor in drafting, specifically if [[Michael Beasley]] would be drafted as highly if he had the same numbers but were white (the discussion originated with [[Tyler Hansbrough]]'s low draft projection despite his numbers).

Le Batard then questioned his qualifications and cited less than successful ventures into both NBA coaching, and NBA broadcasting as well as his television show [[The Magic Hour (talk show)|The Magic Hour]] as evidence that giving Magic Johnson a position in which he apparently lacked experience was a questionable decision.  Of particular note, Le Batard stated that Magic Johnson's main qualification for this job was his ability to be charming and charismatic as well as his fame.  Le Batard made the following comment:\n\n\"What you\u2019ve got here though, is a testament to the power of fame. And a testament to the power of a modicum of charm. Because Magic Johnson is charming. But, Magic Johnson was given a late night television show, because he\u2019s famous and charming. Failed in 11 shows. Magic Johnson was given a head coaching job of the Lakers, because he\u2019s famous and charming, failed in 16 games. Magic Johnson, not interesting as a broadcaster, given broadcasting opportunity after broadcasting opportunity, because he\u2019s famous and charming. And now, he gets to run the entire Lakers organization because he\u2019s famous and charming. That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s a very kind man, to be in his presence is to be awash in all the things people like about celebrity, he will make you feel special, but he wasn\u2019t good at any of those jobs I just mentioned, and he got all of those jobs, bypassing a whole lot of people who are more qualified, because he\u2019s famous and charming.\"\n\nOther ESPN commentators took offense to Le Batard's accusations that Magic Johnson was unqualified and also suggested that race played a part in Le Batard's accusations. [[Keyshawn Johnson]], was asked by [[Jorge Sedano]] \"If you are insinuating that Dan is, like, being prejudiced here...\" and Keyshawn Johnson responded \"That's what I'm insinuating\".  Sedano defended Le Batard, saying \"Well then you are 100% wrong.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/espn-espn-keyshawn-insinuates-le-batard-magic-jab-racist-article-1.2981194|title=ESPN vs. ESPN: Keyshawn insinuates Le Batard's Magic jab racist|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[LZ Granderson]] also hinted that race played a role in Le Batard's comments, stating that Le Batard implied through his comments about Magic Johnson's charisma that Magic Johnson had gotten the job through \"shucking and jiving\". [[Michael Wilbon]] also criticized Le Batard's comments on Twitter, though Wilbon's criticism abstained from any discussion of race.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://larrybrownsports.com/media/michael-wilbon-dan-le-batard-magic-johnson-criticism/352954|title=Michael Wilbon goes after Dan Le Batard over Magic Johnson criticism|date=2017-02-23|work=Larry Brown Sports|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Twitter beef with Michael Rapaport ===\nStemming from the Magic Johnson controversy, actor [[Michael Rapaport]], took to [[Twitter]] to call out Le Batard for his comments on Johnson, insinuating a Twitter beef between him and the show's crew.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://slicemiami.com/2017/02/25/michael-rapaport-le-batard-twitter-mike-ryan/|title=\"Actor\" Michael Rapaport goes after Le Batard family on Twitter, gets eviscerated|last=Baumgard|first=Josh|date=2017-02-25|website=Slice Miami|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref> On February 24, 2017 Rapaport tweeted out, \"Dan Lebatard askin why Magic is runnin the Lakers & the rest of the world is asking why his Father is on TV show everyday.

After a lengthy back and forth, Rapaport still insisted on attacking Ryan, and eventually, another of the show's producers, Roy Bellamy, jumped into the discussion. The Twitter beef reached its climax with Rapaport posting a racist photo of Bellamy and resulting in Ryan and Bellamy finishing their war with Rapaport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MichaelRyanRuiz/status/835615300162838529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http://thebiglead.com/2017/03/02/the-michael-rapaportdan-le-batard-show-feud-has-gotten-very-personal/|title=.@roybelly Don't waste anymore time with ignorant @MichaelRapaport.

Le Batard stated, \"These things are all about value. How much value do you have to the company? Not enough to be putting up racist stuff on Twitter. He doesn\u2019t work for the company. He\u2019s on The Jump every once in awhile. So I\u2019m guessing this is gonna cause him a problem.

Rapaport also threatened them with a defamation lawsuit for accusations that had been made about him having herpes stating, \u201cYou\u2019re claiming that I\u2019m not going work at ESPN?

He repeatedly insulted Le Batard, Stugotz, and the show's producers saying they were only there to get his coffee. Simmons was uncomfortable for the entirety of Rapaport's rant against the show saying, \u201cI still feel awkward because I like all those guys.

When told by Dan about the report of [[Seattle Mariners]] player [[Ichiro Suzuki]] signing a 5-year, $100 million contract, Samson was in a state of disbelief. He went on to say that no player in baseball was worthy of that amount and that this deal would surely return the league to the days of ridiculous contracts, surely ruining the sport.\n\nThe next day, [[Bob Ryan]] of the ''Boston Globe'' appeared on the show to share opinion on the matter. He began by asking if Samson had just entered baseball yesterday. He then went on to criticize both Samson and the Florida Marlins franchise, while calling the deal as one of a well-managed franchise.<ref name=\"Samson\">''790 the Ticket''  [http://www.790theticket.com/audio/1267492097David%20Samson%20Show-%207-11-07.mp3 David Samson's interview on July 11th] Updated 2007-07-11, retrieved 2007-07-12</ref><ref name=\"Bob Ryan\">''790 the Ticket'' [http://www.790theticket.com/audio/1260416199Bob%20Ryan%20Interview-%207-12-07.mp3 Bob Ryan's response to Samson's remarks] Updated 2007-07-12, retrieved 2007-07-12</ref>\n\n=== Jay Bilas racial questions ===\n[[ESPN]] college basketball analyst [[Jay Bilas]] was on the show on April 7, 2008 to discuss NBA Draft prospects.

Le Batard then questioned his qualifications and cited less than successful ventures into both NBA coaching, and NBA broadcasting as well as his television show [[The Magic Hour (talk show)|The Magic Hour]] as evidence that giving Magic Johnson a position in which he apparently lacked experience was a questionable decision.  Of particular note, Le Batard stated that Magic Johnson's main qualification for this job was his ability to be charming and charismatic as well as his fame.  Le Batard made the following comment:\n\n\"What you\u2019ve got here though, is a testament to the power of fame. And a testament to the power of a modicum of charm. Because Magic Johnson is charming. But, Magic Johnson was given a late night television show, because he\u2019s famous and charming. Failed in 11 shows. Magic Johnson was given a head coaching job of the Lakers, because he\u2019s famous and charming, failed in 16 games. Magic Johnson, not interesting as a broadcaster, given broadcasting opportunity after broadcasting opportunity, because he\u2019s famous and charming. And now, he gets to run the entire Lakers organization because he\u2019s famous and charming. That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s a very kind man, to be in his presence is to be awash in all the things people like about celebrity, he will make you feel special, but he wasn\u2019t good at any of those jobs I just mentioned, and he got all of those jobs, bypassing a whole lot of people who are more qualified, because he\u2019s famous and charming.\"\n\nOther ESPN commentators took offense to Le Batard's accusations that Magic Johnson was unqualified and also suggested that race played a part in Le Batard's accusations. [[Keyshawn Johnson]], was asked by [[Jorge Sedano]] \"If you are insinuating that Dan is, like, being prejudiced here...\" and Keyshawn Johnson responded \"That's what I'm insinuating\".  Sedano defended Le Batard, saying \"Well then you are 100% wrong.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/espn-espn-keyshawn-insinuates-le-batard-magic-jab-racist-article-1.2981194|title=ESPN vs. ESPN: Keyshawn insinuates Le Batard's Magic jab racist|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[LZ Granderson]] also hinted that race played a role in Le Batard's comments, stating that Le Batard implied through his comments about Magic Johnson's charisma that Magic Johnson had gotten the job through \"shucking and jiving\".

After a lengthy back and forth, Rapaport still insisted on attacking Ryan, and eventually, another of the show's producers, Roy Bellamy, jumped into the discussion. The Twitter beef reached its climax with Rapaport posting a racist photo of Bellamy and resulting in Ryan and Bellamy finishing their war with Rapaport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MichaelRyanRuiz/status/835615300162838529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http://thebiglead.com/2017/03/02/the-michael-rapaportdan-le-batard-show-feud-has-gotten-very-personal/|title=.@roybelly Don't waste anymore time with ignorant @MichaelRapaport.

{"title_page": "Rite of passage", "text_new": "{{short description|Ceremony or ritual of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi.jpg|center|280px]]|caption=Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi. The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}\n\nA '''rite of passage''' is a [[ceremony]] or [[ritual]] of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', \"The Rites of Passage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}</ref> The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.\n\n== Original conception ==\nIn English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, \"as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors.\"<ref name=Journet>{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une sorte de maison divis\u00e9e en chambres et couloirs}}</ref> A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.\n\nVan Gennep further distinguishes between \"the secular\" and \"the sacred sphere.\" Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent \"the simplest level of development,\" he hypothesizes that \"[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations.\" Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.\n\nThe rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}</ref> \"It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ....\" He is able to find some universals, mainly two: \"the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred.\" (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.\n\n==Stages==\nRites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. \"I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 21</ref>\n\nIn the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. \"The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80.</ref> There is often a detachment or \"cutting away\" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is \"cutting away\" the former self: the civilian.\n\nThe transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. \"The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' (\"threshold people\") are necessarily ambiguous.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 95</ref>\n\nIn the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80</ref> Having completed the rite and assumed their \"new\" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus \"in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 166</ref>\n\n==Psychological effects==\n\nLaboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref>Aronson & Mills 1959.</ref> It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.<ref>Festinger 1961.</ref> [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.<ref>Kamau 2012.</ref> As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.<ref>Keating ''et al.'' 2005.</ref> Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].<ref>Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.</ref>\n\n==Cultural==\n[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|The [[Hamar people|Hamar]] are known for their custom of \"bull jumping,\" which initiates a boy into manhood.]]\nInitiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.<ref name=\"Shahadah\">{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are \"a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body\".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.<ref>[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim</ref> In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].\n\n==Types and examples==\nRites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''.

The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}\n\nA '''rite of passage''' is a [[ceremony]] or [[ritual]] of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', \"The Rites of Passage\".<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}</ref> The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.\n\n== Original conception ==\nIn English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, \"as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors.\"<ref name=Journet>{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une sorte de maison divis\u00e9e en chambres et couloirs}}</ref> A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.\n\nVan Gennep further distinguishes between \"the secular\" and \"the sacred sphere.\" Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent \"the simplest level of development,\" he hypothesizes that \"[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations.\" Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.\n\nThe rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:<ref>{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}</ref> \"It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ....\" He is able to find some universals, mainly two: \"the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred.\" (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.\n\n==Stages==\nRites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. \"I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 21</ref>\n\nIn the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. \"The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80.</ref> There is often a detachment or \"cutting away\" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is \"cutting away\" the former self: the civilian.\n\nThe transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. \"The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' (\"threshold people\") are necessarily ambiguous.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 95</ref>\n\nIn the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject.\"<ref>Turner 1969: 80</ref> Having completed the rite and assumed their \"new\" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus \"in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown.\"<ref>van Gennep 1977: 166</ref>\n\n==Psychological effects==\n\nLaboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref>Aronson & Mills 1959.</ref> It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.<ref>Festinger 1961.</ref> [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.<ref>Kamau 2012.</ref> As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.<ref>Keating ''et al.'' 2005.</ref> Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].<ref>Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.</ref>\n\n==Cultural==\n[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|The [[Hamar people|Hamar]] are known for their custom of \"bull jumping,\" which initiates a boy into manhood.]]\nInitiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.<ref name=\"Shahadah\">{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are \"a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body\".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.<ref>[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim</ref> In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].\n\n==Types and examples==\nRites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. [[Adventure education]] programs, such as [[Outward Bound]], have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase.<ref>Cushing 1998.</ref> Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the \"Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage\" as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.\n\n===Coming of age===\n[[File:Michael's Bar Mitzvah 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish boy reading a [[Torah]] scroll at his [[Bar Mitzvah]], using a [[Yad]]]]\n[[File:Landdiving2.jpg|thumb|[[Land diving]] is a rite of passage for boys of the South Pacific island of [[Pentecost Island|Pentecost]]]]\n[[File:Statuette Karaj\u00e0 MHNT.ETH.2011.17.30.jpg |thumb| Statuette Karaj\u00e0 : young initiate]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main|Coming of age}}\nIn various [[tribe| tribal societies]], entry into an [[age grade]]\u2014generally gender-separated\u2014(unlike an [[age set]]) is marked by an [[initiation| initiation rite]], which may be the crowning of a long and complex preparation, sometimes in retreat.\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]\n* [[Breeching (boys)|Breeching]], when an infant is put into boy's clothing\n* [[Coming of Age (Unitarian Universalism)|Coming of Age in Unitarian Universalism]]\n* Completion of [[toilet training]]\n* [[D\u00e9butante|D\u00e9butante ball]]\n* [[Dokimasia]]\n* First [[menstruation]], i.e. [[menarche]]\n** [[Seclusion of girls at puberty]]\n** ''Sevapuneru'' or [[Gaye holud|Turmeric]] ceremony\n* [[Graduation]]\n* [[Okuyi]] in several [[West African]] nations\n* ''[[Quincea\u00f1era]]''\n* [[Retirement]]\n* ''[[Russefeiring]]'' in [[Norway]]\n* [[Scarification]] and various other physical endurances\n* [[Secular coming of age ceremony|Secular coming of age ceremonies]] for non-religious youngsters who want a rite of passage comparable to the religious rituals like confirmation\n* [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|Sweet Sixteen]]\n* [[Wedding]]\n* [[Walkabout]]\n}}\n\n===Religious===\n[[File:20050921circoncisionB.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Jesus underwent Jewish [[circumcision]], here depicted in a Catholic cathedral; a [[Feast of the Circumcision|liturgical feast]] commemorates this on New Year's Day]]\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''[[Amrit Sanchar]]'' in [[Sikhism]]\n* ''[[Annaprashana]]''\n* [[Baptism]] ([[Infant baptism|Christening]])\n* [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]]\n* [[Circumcision]]\n** [[Brit milah|Bris]] in [[Judaism]] \n** ''[[Khitan (circumcision)|Khitan]]'' in [[Islam]]<ref>Morgenstern 1966.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= Rites of Passage|work= Oxford Islamic Studies Online |year=2013| url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2020?_hi=0&_pos=15 |accessdate= 27 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= Traditional Muslim Male Circumcision: Performed by Arabs, Turkish, Malaysian and Others of this faith. |work= CIRCLIST |url= http://www.circlist.com/rites/moslem.html |year= 1992\u20132013|accessdate= 27 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hamid|first=Ismail|title=Islamic Rites of Passage|work=The Encyclopedia of Malaysia Volume 10: Religions and Beliefs|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/islamicrites.html|year=2005|accessdate=27 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630163708/http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/islamicrites.html|archivedate=30 June 2013}}</ref>\n** In [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]<ref name=riggs_2006>{{cite book |author=Thomas Riggs |title=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices: Religions and denominations |chapter=Christianity: Coptic Christianity |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale |isbn=978-0-7876-6612-5 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTMOAQAAMAAJ}}</ref><ref name=Columbia_encyc_2011_circ>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Circumcision |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/circumcision.html }}</ref>\n* [[Confirmation]] in Western [[Christianity]]\n* Diving for the Cross, in some [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] churches\n* [[First Communion]], First [[Eucharist]] and First [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]\n* Siddur presentation ceremony in Judaism\n* Bible presentation ceremony in several branches of [[Protestantism]] \n* [[Hajj]] in [[Islam]]\n* [[Chudakarana]] or hair cutting in Hinduism\n* [[Rumspringa]]\n* ''[[Sanskara (rite of passage)|Sanskara]]'' a series of [[sacrament]]s in [[Hinduism]]\n* ''[[Shinbyu]]'' in [[Theravada Buddhism]]\n* [[Vision quest]] in some Native American cultures\n* [[Wiccaning]] in [[Wicca]]\n}}\n\n===Military===\n* [[Recruit training|Boot Camp]] and [[Officer Candidate School]] are rites of passage from civilian to military life.

[https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=3976 Waterhouse mill], now demolished, off Wellington Road, once spun the finest cotton in the world, and was sought after by lace makers in Nottingham and Brussels.\n\n[[Clarence Mill]] still stands. The lower floors remain commercial but the upper floors have been converted into apartments. One of the oldest surviving mills in Bollington is the very small [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=3950 Defiance Mill], built in [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=2375 Queen Street] about 1800 and now restored for residential occupation.\n\nThere is a large [[coated paper|paper coating]] mill on the site of [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=3962 Lower Mills]. The original mill was built by [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=5035 George Antrobus] in 1792 but very little of those buildings remain. A stone-built traditional mill still survives amongst the more recent brick developments. In the 1830s and 1840s this mill was rented to Thomas Oliver and [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=5095 Martin Swindells] for the production of fine cotton thread for the [[lace-making]] industry. [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=3964 Lowerhouse mill] (Antrobus, 1819, later occupied by [[Samuel Greg (junior)|Samuel Greg Jnr]]) also remains as an industrial mill, also producing coated papers.\n\nThe other remaining mill is [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=3933 Adelphi mill] (Swindells, 1856), which is today entirely commercial. A full list of Bollington's mills with some histories can be found on the [https://happyvalley.org.uk/?page_id=3931 Happy Valley website].\n\nIn  1801, the population was 1,231.

The railway was built in 1869 by the [[Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway]] (MS&LR) and the [[North Staffordshire Railway]] (NSR), as a part of a quest to provide an alternative link between [[Manchester]] and the south, that was independent of the [[London & North Western Railway]] (L&NWR). Cotton mill owner Thomas Oliver had suggested this route hoping to revive the cotton mills of Bollington, the [[Kerridge]] stone quarries as well as the coal fields at [[Poynton]].

They included particularly [[Whittington Castle]], held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen.

Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington.<ref>T.D.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

(\"Blacktop\" means an asphalt road.) As they drive east on Route 66 from [[Needles, California]], they pick up the Girl (Bird), a female [[hitchhiker]], in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], when she gets into their car at a diner. Although the Driver develops a crush on the Girl, she sleeps with the Mechanic when the Driver goes out drinking one night. In [[New Mexico]] they begin to encounter another car driver, [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] (Oates), on the highways. An atmosphere of hostility develops between the two parties. Although GTO is not an overt street racer and seems to know little about cars, a cross-country race to [[Washington, D.C.]] is suggested. The Driver proposes that the prize should be \"[[Vehicle title|pinks]]\" (pink slips), or legal ownership of the loser's car. Along the way, GTO picks up various hitchhikers, including an importuning homosexual hitchhiker ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]). When GTO's inexperience becomes apparent, he, the Driver and the Mechanic form an uneasy alliance; the Driver even drives with him for a while when GTO gets fatigued.\n\nNeeding money, the Driver, the Mechanic and GTO compete at a race track in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. While the Driver finishes his race, the Girl hops into GTO's car and they leave. The Driver pursues them to a diner located on US-129 (a location today known as the Tail of the Dragon) where the Girl has just rejected GTO's idea to visit [[Chicago]]. The Driver proposes going to [[Columbus, Ohio]], to get parts, but the Girl rejects him too. Instead, she leaves with a stranger on a motorcycle, abandoning her belongings in the parking lot. Later, GTO picks up two soldiers and tells them that he won his car by beating two men driving a custom-built 1955 Chevrolet 150 in a cross-country race. At an airstrip in East Tennessee, the Driver races against a [[Chevrolet El Camino]]. The film ends abruptly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Taylor]] as The Driver\n* [[Warren Oates]] as [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]]\n* [[Laurie Bird]] as The Girl\n* [[Dennis Wilson]] as The Mechanic\n* [[Rudy Wurlitzer|Rudolph Wurlitzer]] as Hot Rod Driver\n* Bill Keller as Texas Hitchhiker\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton|H.D.

Hellman and Wurlitzer agreed to keep the basic idea of the cross-country race as well as the characters of the Driver, the Mechanic and the Girl. Wurlitzer invented the GTO character and the rest of the supporting cast.<ref name= \"hellman\"/> To prepare for writing the script, he stayed in a [[Los Angeles]] motel and read car magazines, as well as hanging out with several obsessive mechanics and \"stoner car freaks\" in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Wurlitzer said that he did not know much about cars, but did \"know something about being lost on the road\".<ref name=\"obrien\">{{cite news | last= O'Brien | first= Joe | url= | title=On the Drift: Rudy Wurlitzer and the Road to Nowhere | work=Arthur magazine | date= May 2008 | accessdate= }}</ref> He wrote a new script in four weeks.<ref name= \"walker\"/>\n\nIn February 1970, Hellman began [[location scouting]] and was a few weeks from principal photography when Cinema Center suddenly canceled the project.<ref name= \"walker\"/> He shopped the script around to several Hollywood studios that liked it, but wanted a say in the casting. However, [[Ned Tanen]], a young executive at [[Universal Pictures]] gave Hellman $850,000 to make the film and gave him control of the final cut.<ref name= \"walker\"/> Hellman saw a picture of James Taylor on a billboard on the [[Sunset Strip]] and asked the musician to come and do a screen test.<ref name= \"savlov\"/> Four days before beginning principal photography the role of the Mechanic was still not cast.

It affected everybody\".<ref name= \"walker\"/> Hellman took an unconventional approach of not letting his three lead, inexperienced actors read the script. Instead, he gave them pages of dialogue on the day of shooting. The actors felt uncomfortable with this approach.<ref name= \"walker\"/> In particular, James Taylor, used to having control when it came to his music, was upset at being unable to read the script in advance. Hellman eventually gave him permission to do so, but Taylor never did read it.<ref name= \"benoit\"/>\n\nHellman shot almost the entire script as written. The first cut of the film was three-and-a-half hours long,<ref name= \"hellman\"/> in which Hellman was the editor. \"I can't look over someone's shoulder. I need my hand on the brake\".<ref name= \"benoit\"/> He had control of the final cut, but was contractually obliged to deliver a film no longer than two hours.

They couldn't accept the movie for what it was\".<ref name= \"liebenson\"/> There was a lot of advance buzz about the film, but [[Lew Wasserman]], head of the studio saw the film and hated it. He refused to promote it and when it opened in [[New York City]] on the [[Fourth of July]] weekend, there were no newspaper ads promoting it.<ref name= \"savlov\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nUnlike other existential road movies of the time (such as ''[[Easy Rider]]'' and ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]''), ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' does not rely heavily on music, nor was a soundtrack album released. The music featured in the film covers many genres, including rock, folk, blues, country, bluegrass, and R&B. [[James Taylor]] and [[Dennis Wilson]] did not contribute any music.\n\nHowever, there are some notable tracks featured in the film, including \"[[Moonlight Drive]]\" by [[The Doors]], \"[[Maybellene]]\" performed by [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond]], the traditional folk tune \"[[Stealin']]\" performed by [[Arlo Guthrie]], and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" performed by the song's author [[Kris Kristofferson]]. A song titled \"Truckload Of Art\" written and performed by [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]] can be briefly heard coming out of the GTO.\n\nIn 2003 Plain Records issued a tribute album made in honor of this cult classic called \"[http://www.cityhallrecords.com/item/1000027053.htm You Can Never Go Fast Enough]\"  featuring exclusive tracks by Wilco, Sonic Youth, Will Oldham/Alan Licht, Calexico & Giant Sand, Suntanama, Steffen Basho-Junghans, Charalambides, Mark Eitzel/Marc Capelle, Roy Montgomery and Alvarius B with rare tracks by Cat Power, Roscoe Holcomb, Leadbelly & Sandy Bull.\n\n==Reaction==\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"What I liked about ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' was the sense of life that occasionally sneaked through, particularly in the character of G.T.O.

(\"Blacktop\" means an asphalt road.) As they drive east on Route 66 from [[Needles, California]], they pick up the Girl (Bird), a female [[hitchhiker]], in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], when she gets into their car at a diner. Although the Driver develops a crush on the Girl, she sleeps with the Mechanic when the Driver goes out drinking one night. In [[New Mexico]] they begin to encounter another car driver, [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] (Oates), on the highways. An atmosphere of hostility develops between the two parties. Although GTO is not an overt street racer and seems to know little about cars, a cross-country race to [[Washington, D.C.]] is suggested. The Driver proposes that the prize should be \"[[Vehicle title|pinks]]\" (pink slips), or legal ownership of the loser's car. Along the way, GTO picks up various hitchhikers, including an importuning homosexual hitchhiker ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]). When GTO's inexperience becomes apparent, he, the Driver and the Mechanic form an uneasy alliance; the Driver even drives with him for a while when GTO gets fatigued.\n\nNeeding money, the Driver, the Mechanic and GTO compete at a race track in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. While the Driver finishes his race, the Girl hops into GTO's car and they leave. The Driver pursues them to a diner located on US-129 (a location today known as the Tail of the Dragon) where the Girl has just rejected GTO's idea to visit [[Chicago]]. The Driver proposes going to [[Columbus, Ohio]], to get parts, but the Girl rejects him too. Instead, she leaves with a stranger on a motorcycle, abandoning her belongings in the parking lot. Later, GTO picks up two soldiers and tells them that he won his car by beating two men driving a custom-built 1955 Chevrolet 150 in a cross-country race. At an airstrip in East Tennessee, the Driver races against a [[Chevrolet El Camino]]. The film ends abruptly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Taylor]] as The Driver\n* [[Warren Oates]] as [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]]\n* [[Laurie Bird]] as The Girl\n* [[Dennis Wilson]] as The Mechanic\n* [[Rudy Wurlitzer|Rudolph Wurlitzer]] as Hot Rod Driver\n* Bill Keller as Texas Hitchhiker\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton|H.D.

A friend of Hellman's recommended underground writer [[Rudolph Wurlitzer]].<ref name= \"hellman\"/> Hellman read his novel ''Nog'' and was impressed enough to hire Wurlitzer, who began reading Corry's story, but gave up after five pages. Hellman and Wurlitzer agreed to keep the basic idea of the cross-country race as well as the characters of the Driver, the Mechanic and the Girl. Wurlitzer invented the GTO character and the rest of the supporting cast.<ref name= \"hellman\"/> To prepare for writing the script, he stayed in a [[Los Angeles]] motel and read car magazines, as well as hanging out with several obsessive mechanics and \"stoner car freaks\" in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Wurlitzer said that he did not know much about cars, but did \"know something about being lost on the road\".<ref name=\"obrien\">{{cite news | last= O'Brien | first= Joe | url= | title=On the Drift: Rudy Wurlitzer and the Road to Nowhere | work=Arthur magazine | date= May 2008 | accessdate= }}</ref> He wrote a new script in four weeks.<ref name= \"walker\"/>\n\nIn February 1970, Hellman began [[location scouting]] and was a few weeks from principal photography when Cinema Center suddenly canceled the project.<ref name= \"walker\"/> He shopped the script around to several Hollywood studios that liked it, but wanted a say in the casting. However, [[Ned Tanen]], a young executive at [[Universal Pictures]] gave Hellman $850,000 to make the film and gave him control of the final cut.<ref name= \"walker\"/> Hellman saw a picture of James Taylor on a billboard on the [[Sunset Strip]] and asked the musician to come and do a screen test.<ref name= \"savlov\"/> Four days before beginning principal photography the role of the Mechanic was still not cast. Hellman was desperate and tested people he met in garages. A friend of casting director [[Fred Roos]] suggested musician Dennis Wilson.<ref name=\"benoit\">{{cite news | last= Benoit | first= Shelly | url= | title=The Making of ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' | work=Show magazine | date= March 1971 | accessdate= }}</ref> Wilson was the last actor cast and Hellman chose him because he felt that the musician \"had lived that role, that he really grew up with cars\".<ref name= \"savlov\"/>\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 13, 1970 in Los Angeles and lasted for eight weeks with a crew of 30, three matching Chevrolets and two matching G.T.O.s traveling through the southwest towards [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name= \"walker\"/><ref name= \"benoit\"/> Hellman insisted on going across country, like the characters in the film, because he felt it was the only way to convince the audience that the characters raced across the United States. He said, \"I knew it would affect the actors&nbsp;\u2014 and it did, obviously. It affected everybody\".<ref name= \"walker\"/> Hellman took an unconventional approach of not letting his three lead, inexperienced actors read the script. Instead, he gave them pages of dialogue on the day of shooting. The actors felt uncomfortable with this approach.<ref name= \"walker\"/> In particular, James Taylor, used to having control when it came to his music, was upset at being unable to read the script in advance. Hellman eventually gave him permission to do so, but Taylor never did read it.<ref name= \"benoit\"/>\n\nHellman shot almost the entire script as written. The first cut of the film was three-and-a-half hours long,<ref name= \"hellman\"/> in which Hellman was the editor. \"I can't look over someone's shoulder. I need my hand on the brake\".<ref name= \"benoit\"/> He had control of the final cut, but was contractually obliged to deliver a film no longer than two hours. The final version ran 105 minutes.<ref name= \"hellman\"/> In their April 1971 cover story, ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine proclaimed ''Two-Lane Blacktop'', \"film of the year\".<ref name= \"savlov\"/> Hellman initially thought that the ''Esquire'' article would be good publicity for the film, but in hindsight was not, because \"I think it raised people's expectations. They couldn't accept the movie for what it was\".<ref name= \"liebenson\"/> There was a lot of advance buzz about the film, but [[Lew Wasserman]], head of the studio saw the film and hated it. He refused to promote it and when it opened in [[New York City]] on the [[Fourth of July]] weekend, there were no newspaper ads promoting it.<ref name= \"savlov\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nUnlike other existential road movies of the time (such as ''[[Easy Rider]]'' and ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]''), ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' does not rely heavily on music, nor was a soundtrack album released. The music featured in the film covers many genres, including rock, folk, blues, country, bluegrass, and R&B. [[James Taylor]] and [[Dennis Wilson]] did not contribute any music.\n\nHowever, there are some notable tracks featured in the film, including \"[[Moonlight Drive]]\" by [[The Doors]], \"[[Maybellene]]\" performed by [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond]], the traditional folk tune \"[[Stealin']]\" performed by [[Arlo Guthrie]], and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" performed by the song's author [[Kris Kristofferson]]. A song titled \"Truckload Of Art\" written and performed by [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]] can be briefly heard coming out of the GTO.\n\nIn 2003 Plain Records issued a tribute album made in honor of this cult classic called \"[http://www.cityhallrecords.com/item/1000027053.htm You Can Never Go Fast Enough]\"  featuring exclusive tracks by Wilco, Sonic Youth, Will Oldham/Alan Licht, Calexico & Giant Sand, Suntanama, Steffen Basho-Junghans, Charalambides, Mark Eitzel/Marc Capelle, Roy Montgomery and Alvarius B with rare tracks by Cat Power, Roscoe Holcomb, Leadbelly & Sandy Bull.\n\n==Reaction==\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"What I liked about ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' was the sense of life that occasionally sneaked through, particularly in the character of G.T.O.
