From 1970 to 1973, he worked at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury, then an experimental college on Long Island; he began as assistant to the school's president and subsequently became a lecturer in the American Studies program.\n\n==Acting career==\nTalbot's first appearance as Gilbert on [[Leave it to Beaver]] was in a 1959 episode called \"Beaver and Gilbert\", where he plays an insecure new kid in town who is prone to telling tall tales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630183/|title=Beaver and Gilbert|date=March 19, 1959|publisher=IMDb}}</ref> Early on in the series, the Gilbert character was someone constantly getting the hapless Beaver into trouble. \"I may be a dirty rat, but I'm not a dumb rat,\" Gilbert once declared. But as the series went on Gilbert became a more genuine friend of the Beav, really his closest friend, as seen in episodes like \"Beaver on TV\" (1963) when Gilbert is the only one to believe Beaver had been on a local TV show that did not air live as everyone expected (it had been taped for later broadcast, a new concept at the time).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630188/]</ref>\n\nHaving spent his early years in front of the cameras on ''Leave it to Beaver'' as Gilbert Bates (56 episodes), Talbot abandoned acting for a career as a journalist. In an article for [[Salon.com]] in 1997, he looked back with a sense of humor about his past role.\n\n<blockquote>In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell \u2013 that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug').\"!<ref name=\"talbot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/aug97/mothers/beaver970822.html|title=Living Down Beaver|last=Talbot|first=Stephen|work=Salon|accessdate=2006-10-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205114704/https://www.salon.com/aug97/mothers/beaver970822.html|archivedate=2007-02-05}}</ref> \"I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my ''Leave it to Beaver'' past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work. But how could I have known as an innocent 9-year-old that I was taking part in a television program that would live on for 40 years as an icon for baby boomers? In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a [[The New Leave It to Beaver|dreadful ''Beaver'' reunion series]]. \"I'm trying to establish myself as a documentary filmmaker and an investigative reporter,\" I explained to the producers. \"I can't go back to being Gilbert!\"<ref name=\"talbot\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nTalbot guest-starred on many television programs in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including three episodes of ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[M Squad]]'', ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'', ''[[The Blue Angels (TV series)|The Blue Angels]]'', ''[[Men Into Space]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Mr. Novak]]'' and ''[[The Lucy Show]]''. He appeared in comedy sketches with [[Bob Newhart]] in the early '60s NBC variety program, ''[[The Bob Newhart Show (1961 TV series)|The Bob Newhart Show]]''. Talbot played the role of Ronnie Kramer in the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s [[anthology series]] ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'' episode \"Hit and Run\". Talbot also appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'': \"[[Static (The Twilight Zone)|Static]]\" and \"[[The Fugitive (The Twilight Zone)|The Fugitive]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen Talbot|publisher=IMDb |url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0847972/|accessdate=2014-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, he was cast as Ab Martin, a grade-school pupil in the episode \"The Twister\" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', with [[Will Hutchins]] in the title role. In the episode, he recites to his dying teacher, Roy Cantwell (Fred Beir) a part of [[Patrick Henry]]'s 1775 address at [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)|St. Johns' Church]].
