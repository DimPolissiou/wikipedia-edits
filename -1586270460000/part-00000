On the other hand, every symplectic structure is isomorphic to one of the form {{nowrap|''V'' \u2295 ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>}}. The subspace ''V'' is not unique, and a choice of subspace ''V'' is called a '''polarization.''' The subspaces that give such an isomorphism are called '''Lagrangian subspaces''' or simply '''Lagrangians.'''\n\nExplicitly, given a Lagrangian subspace (as defined below), then a choice of basis {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'')}} defines a dual basis for a complement, by {{nowrap|1=''\u03c9''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''y''<sub>''j''</sub>) = ''\u03b4''<sub>''ij''</sub>}}.\n\n===Analogy with complex structures===\nJust as every symplectic structure is isomorphic to one of the form {{nowrap|''V'' \u2295 ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, every [[linear complex structure|''complex'' structure]] on a vector space is isomorphic to one of the form {{nowrap|''V'' \u2295 ''V''}}. Using these structures, the [[tangent bundle]] of an ''n''-manifold, considered as a 2''n''-manifold, has an [[almost complex structure]], and the [[cotangent bundle|''co''tangent bundle]] of an ''n''-manifold, considered as a 2''n''-manifold, has a symplectic structure: {{nowrap|1=''T''<sub>\u2217</sub>(''T''<sup>\u2217</sup>''M'')<sub>''p''</sub> = ''T''<sub>''p''</sub>(''M'') \u2295 (''T''<sub>''p''</sub>(''M''))<sup>\u2217</sup>}}.\n\nThe complex analog to a Lagrangian subspace is a [[real subspace|''real'' subspace]], a subspace whose [[complexification]] is the whole space: {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''V'' \u2295 ''J'' ''V''}}. As can be seen from the standard symplectic form above, every symplectic form on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{2n}</math> is isomorphic to the imaginary part of the standard complex (Hermitian) inner product on <math>\\mathbb{C}^{n}</math> (with the convention of the first argument being anti-linear).\n\n==Volume form==\nLet ''\u03c9'' be an [[alternating bilinear form]] on an ''n''-dimensional real vector space ''V'', {{nowrap|''\u03c9'' \u2208 \u039b<sup>2</sup>(''V'')}}. Then ''\u03c9'' is non-degenerate if and only if ''n'' is even and {{nowrap|1=''\u03c9''<sup>''n''/2</sup> = ''\u03c9'' \u2227 ... \u2227 ''\u03c9''}} is a [[volume form]].  A volume form on a ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' is a non-zero multiple of the ''n''-form {{nowrap|''e''<sub>1</sub><sup>\u2217</sup> \u2227 ... \u2227 ''e''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>\u2217</sup>}} where {{nowrap|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ''e''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a basis of ''V''.\n\nFor the standard basis defined in the previous section, we have\n\n:<math>\\omega^n=(-1)^{n/2} x^*_1\\wedge\\ldots \\wedge x^*_n \\wedge y^*_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge y^*_n.</math>\n\nBy reordering, one can write\n\n:<math>\\omega^n= x^*_1\\wedge y^*_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge x^*_n \\wedge y^*_n.</math>\n\nAuthors variously define ''\u03c9''<sup>''n''</sup> or (\u22121)<sup>''n''/2</sup>''\u03c9''<sup>''n''</sup> as the '''standard volume form'''. An occasional factor of ''n''! may also appear, depending on whether the definition of the [[alternating product]] contains a factor of ''n''! or not.  The volume form defines an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] on the symplectic vector space {{nowrap|(''V'', ''\u03c9'')}}.\n\n==Symplectic map==\nSuppose that {{nowrap|(''V'', ''\u03c9'')}} and {{nowrap|(''W'', ''\u03c1'')}} are symplectic vector spaces. Then a [[linear map]] {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is called a '''symplectic map''' if the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] preserves the symplectic form, i.e. {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>''\u03c1'' = ''\u03c9''}}, where the pullback form is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>''\u03c1'')(''u'', ''v'') = ''\u03c1''(''f''(''u''), ''f''(''v''))}}. Symplectic maps are volume- and orientation-preserving.\n\n==Symplectic group==\nIf {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, then a symplectic map is called a '''linear symplectic transformation''' of ''V''. In particular, in this case one has that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c9''(''f''(''u''), ''f''(''v'')) = ''\u03c9''(''u'', ''v'')}}, and so the [[linear transformation]] ''f'' preserves the symplectic form.  The set of all symplectic transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and in particular a [[Lie group]], called the [[symplectic group]] and denoted by Sp(''V'') or sometimes {{nowrap|Sp(''V'', ''\u03c9'')}}.  In matrix form symplectic transformations are given by [[symplectic matrix|symplectic matrices]].\n\n==Subspaces==\nLet ''W'' be a [[linear subspace]] of ''V''. Define the '''symplectic complement''' of ''W'' to be the subspace\n:<math>W^\\perp = \\{v\\in V \\mid \\omega(v,w) = 0 \\mbox{ for all } w\\in W\\}.</math>\nThe symplectic complement satisfies:\n\n:<math>(W^\\perp)^\\perp = W</math>\n:<math>\\dim W + \\dim W^\\perp = \\dim V.</math>\n\nHowever, unlike [[orthogonal complement]]s, ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2229 ''W'' need not be 0. We distinguish four cases:\n\n*''W'' is '''symplectic''' if {{nowrap|1=''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2229 ''W'' = {0}}}. This is true [[if and only if]] ''\u03c9'' restricts to a nondegenerate form on ''W''. A symplectic subspace with the restricted form is a symplectic vector space in its own right.\n*''W'' is '''isotropic''' if {{nowrap|''W'' \u2286 ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>}}. This is true if and only if ''\u03c9'' restricts to 0 on ''W''. Any one-dimensional subspace is isotropic.\n*''W'' is '''coisotropic''' if {{nowrap|''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2286 ''W''}}. ''W'' is coisotropic if and only if ''\u03c9'' descends to a nondegenerate form on the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''W''/''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>. Equivalently ''W'' is coisotropic if and only if ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> is isotropic. Any [[codimension]]-one subspace is coisotropic.\n*''W'' is '''Lagrangian''' if {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>}}. A subspace is Lagrangian if and only if it is both isotropic and coisotropic. In a finite-dimensional vector space, a Lagrangian subspace is an isotropic one whose dimension is half that of ''V''. Every isotropic subspace can be extended to a Lagrangian one.\n\nReferring to the canonical vector space '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> above,\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>} is symplectic\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>} is isotropic\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>} is coisotropic\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} is Lagrangian.\n\n==Heisenberg group==\n{{main|Heisenberg group}}\nA [[Heisenberg group]] can be defined for any symplectic vector space, and this is the typical way that [[Heisenberg group]]s arise.\n\nA vector space can be thought of as a commutative Lie group (under addition), or equivalently as a commutative [[Lie algebra]], meaning with trivial Lie bracket. The Heisenberg group is a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of such a commutative Lie group/algebra: the symplectic form defines the commutation, analogously to the [[canonical commutation relation]]s (CCR), and a Darboux basis corresponds to [[canonical coordinate]]s&nbsp;\u2013 in physics terms, to [[momentum operator]]s and [[position operator]]s.\n\nIndeed, by the [[Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem]], every representation satisfying the CCR (every representation of the Heisenberg group) is of this form, or more properly unitarily conjugate to the standard one.\n\nFurther, the [[group ring|group algebra]] of (the dual to) a vector space is the [[symmetric algebra]], and the group algebra of the Heisenberg group (of the dual) is the [[Weyl algebra]]: one can think of the central extension as corresponding to quantization or [[Deformation quantization|deformation]].\n\nFormally, the symmetric algebra of ''V'' is the group algebra of the dual, {{nowrap|1=Sym(''V'') := ''K''[''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>]}}, and the Weyl algebra is the group algebra of the (dual) Heisenberg group {{nowrap|1=''W''(''V'') = ''K''[''H''(''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>)]}}. Since passing to group algebras is a [[contravariant functor]], the  central extension map {{nowrap|''H''(''V'') \u2192 ''V''}} becomes an inclusion {{nowrap|Sym(''V'') \u2192 ''W''(''V'')}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n* A [[symplectic manifold]] is a [[smooth manifold]] with a smoothly-varying ''closed'' symplectic form on each [[tangent space]]\n* [[Maslov index]]\n* A [[symplectic representation]] is a [[group representation]] where each group element acts as a symplectic transformation.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Ralph Abraham (mathematician) |first=Ralph |last=Abraham |first2=Jerrold E. |last2=Marsden |authorlink2=Jerrold E.

A volume form on a ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' is a non-zero multiple of the ''n''-form {{nowrap|''e''<sub>1</sub><sup>\u2217</sup> \u2227 ... \u2227 ''e''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>\u2217</sup>}} where {{nowrap|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ''e''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a basis of ''V''.\n\nFor the standard basis defined in the previous section, we have\n\n:<math>\\omega^n=(-1)^{n/2} x^*_1\\wedge\\ldots \\wedge x^*_n \\wedge y^*_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge y^*_n.</math>\n\nBy reordering, one can write\n\n:<math>\\omega^n= x^*_1\\wedge y^*_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge x^*_n \\wedge y^*_n.</math>\n\nAuthors variously define ''\u03c9''<sup>''n''</sup> or (\u22121)<sup>''n''/2</sup>''\u03c9''<sup>''n''</sup> as the '''standard volume form'''. An occasional factor of ''n''! may also appear, depending on whether the definition of the [[alternating product]] contains a factor of ''n''! or not.  The volume form defines an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] on the symplectic vector space {{nowrap|(''V'', ''\u03c9'')}}.\n\n==Symplectic map==\nSuppose that {{nowrap|(''V'', ''\u03c9'')}} and {{nowrap|(''W'', ''\u03c1'')}} are symplectic vector spaces. Then a [[linear map]] {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is called a '''symplectic map''' if the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] preserves the symplectic form, i.e. {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>''\u03c1'' = ''\u03c9''}}, where the pullback form is defined by {{nowrap|1=(''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>''\u03c1'')(''u'', ''v'') = ''\u03c1''(''f''(''u''), ''f''(''v''))}}. Symplectic maps are volume- and orientation-preserving.\n\n==Symplectic group==\nIf {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}}, then a symplectic map is called a '''linear symplectic transformation''' of ''V''. In particular, in this case one has that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c9''(''f''(''u''), ''f''(''v'')) = ''\u03c9''(''u'', ''v'')}}, and so the [[linear transformation]] ''f'' preserves the symplectic form.  The set of all symplectic transformations forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and in particular a [[Lie group]], called the [[symplectic group]] and denoted by Sp(''V'') or sometimes {{nowrap|Sp(''V'', ''\u03c9'')}}.  In matrix form symplectic transformations are given by [[symplectic matrix|symplectic matrices]].\n\n==Subspaces==\nLet ''W'' be a [[linear subspace]] of ''V''. Define the '''symplectic complement''' of ''W'' to be the subspace\n:<math>W^\\perp = \\{v\\in V \\mid \\omega(v,w) = 0 \\mbox{ for all } w\\in W\\}.</math>\nThe symplectic complement satisfies:\n\n:<math>(W^\\perp)^\\perp = W</math>\n:<math>\\dim W + \\dim W^\\perp = \\dim V.</math>\n\nHowever, unlike [[orthogonal complement]]s, ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2229 ''W'' need not be 0. We distinguish four cases:\n\n*''W'' is '''symplectic''' if {{nowrap|1=''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2229 ''W'' = {0}}}. This is true [[if and only if]] ''\u03c9'' restricts to a nondegenerate form on ''W''. A symplectic subspace with the restricted form is a symplectic vector space in its own right.\n*''W'' is '''isotropic''' if {{nowrap|''W'' \u2286 ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>}}. This is true if and only if ''\u03c9'' restricts to 0 on ''W''. Any one-dimensional subspace is isotropic.\n*''W'' is '''coisotropic''' if {{nowrap|''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2286 ''W''}}. ''W'' is coisotropic if and only if ''\u03c9'' descends to a nondegenerate form on the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''W''/''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>. Equivalently ''W'' is coisotropic if and only if ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> is isotropic. Any [[codimension]]-one subspace is coisotropic.\n*''W'' is '''Lagrangian''' if {{nowrap|1=''W'' = ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>}}. A subspace is Lagrangian if and only if it is both isotropic and coisotropic. In a finite-dimensional vector space, a Lagrangian subspace is an isotropic one whose dimension is half that of ''V''. Every isotropic subspace can be extended to a Lagrangian one.\n\nReferring to the canonical vector space '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> above,\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>} is symplectic\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>} is isotropic\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>} is coisotropic\n* the subspace spanned by {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} is Lagrangian.\n\n==Heisenberg group==\n{{main|Heisenberg group}}\nA [[Heisenberg group]] can be defined for any symplectic vector space, and this is the typical way that [[Heisenberg group]]s arise.\n\nA vector space can be thought of as a commutative Lie group (under addition), or equivalently as a commutative [[Lie algebra]], meaning with trivial Lie bracket. The Heisenberg group is a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of such a commutative Lie group/algebra: the symplectic form defines the commutation, analogously to the [[canonical commutation relation]]s (CCR), and a Darboux basis corresponds to [[canonical coordinate]]s&nbsp;\u2013 in physics terms, to [[momentum operator]]s and [[position operator]]s.\n\nIndeed, by the [[Stone\u2013von Neumann theorem]], every representation satisfying the CCR (every representation of the Heisenberg group) is of this form, or more properly unitarily conjugate to the standard one.\n\nFurther, the [[group algebra]] of (the dual to) a vector space is the [[symmetric algebra]], and the group algebra of the Heisenberg group (of the dual) is the [[Weyl algebra]]: one can think of the central extension as corresponding to quantization or [[Deformation quantization|deformation]].\n\nFormally, the symmetric algebra of ''V'' is the group algebra of the dual, {{nowrap|1=Sym(''V'') := ''K''[''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>]}}, and the Weyl algebra is the group algebra of the (dual) Heisenberg group {{nowrap|1=''W''(''V'') = ''K''[''H''(''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>)]}}. Since passing to group algebras is a [[contravariant functor]], the  central extension map {{nowrap|''H''(''V'') \u2192 ''V''}} becomes an inclusion {{nowrap|Sym(''V'') \u2192 ''W''(''V'')}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n* A [[symplectic manifold]] is a [[smooth manifold]] with a smoothly-varying ''closed'' symplectic form on each [[tangent space]]\n* [[Maslov index]]\n* A [[symplectic representation]] is a [[group representation]] where each group element acts as a symplectic transformation.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Ralph Abraham (mathematician) |first=Ralph |last=Abraham |first2=Jerrold E. |last2=Marsden |authorlink2=Jerrold E.

{"title_page": "Atmospheric temperature", "text_new": "{{Comparison_US_standard_atmosphere_1962.svg}}\n'''Atmospheric temperature''' is a measure of [[temperature]] at different levels of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is governed by many factors, including [[insolation|incoming solar radiation]], [[humidity]] and [[altitude]]. When discussing [[surface air temperature]], the annual [[atmospheric temperature range]] at any geographical location depends largely upon the type of [[biome]], as measured by the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n\n==Temperature versus height==\n[[File:Atmospheric_Temperature_Trend.jpg|thumb|200px|These images show temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured by a series of satellite-based instruments between January 1979 and December 2005. The measurements were taken by Microwave Sounding Units and Advanced Microwave Sounding Units flying on a series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellites.

These layers include: the [[Troposphere]], [[Stratosphere]], [[Mesosphere]], and [[Thermosphere]].\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest of the four layers, extending from the surface of the Earth to about 11km into the atmosphere where the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the troposphere stratosphere) is located. The width of the troposphere can vary depending on latitude, for example, the troposphere is thicker in the tropics (about 16km) because the tropics are generally warmer,  and thinner at the poles (about 8km) because the poles are colder.  Temperatures in the atmosphere decrease with height at an average rate of 6.5\u00b0C/ Km. Because the troposphere experiences its warmest temperatures closer to Earth's surface, there is great vertical movement of heat and water vapour, causing turbulence. This turbulence, in conjunction with the presence of water vapour, is the reason that weather occurs within the troposphere.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ross, Sheila Loudon, 1958-,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/812064583|title=Weather and climate : an introduction|isbn=978-0-19-544587-9|location=Don Mills, Ontario, Canada|oclc=812064583}}</ref><ref>Thompson, Russell D..

This layer extends from the tropopause to the stratopause which is located at an altitude of about 50 Km. Temperatures remain constant with height from the tropopause to an altitude of 20 Km, after which they start to increase with height. This happening is referred to as an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] and It is because of this inversion that the stratosphere is not characterised as turbulent. The stratosphere receives its warmth from the sun and the ozone layer which absorbs ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe next layer is called the mesosphere which extends from the stratopause to the mesopause, located at an altitude of 85 Km. Temperatures in the mesopause decrease with height.\n\nThe fourth layer of the atmosphere is known as the thermosphere which extends from the mesopause to the 'top' of the atmosphere. Some of the warmest temperatures can be found in the [[thermosphere]], due to its reception of strong [[ionizing radiation]] at the level of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]\n\n==Temperature range== \nThe variation in temperature that occurs from the highs of the day to the cool of nights is called [[diurnal temperature variation]]. Temperature ranges can also be based on periods of a month, or a year. \n\nThe size of ground-level atmospheric temperature ranges depends on several factors, such as:\n\n* The average temperature\n* The average [[humidity]]\n* The regime of [[wind]]s (intensity, duration, variation, temperature, etc.)\n* The proximity to large bodies of [[water]], such as the [[sea]]\n\n[[File:Temperature-campinas.jpg|thumb|left|Average maximum, minimum and range of monthly air temperatures recorded in [[Campinas]], [[Brazil]], between January 2001 and July 2006]]\n[[File:Temperature-aracaju.jpg|right|thumb|Average maximum, minimum and range of monthly air temperatures recorded in [[Aracaju]], state of [[Sergipe]], [[Brazil]], between January 2001 and July 2006]]\nThe figure at below-left shows an example of monthly temperatures recorded at one of such locations, the city of [[Campinas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], which lies approximately 60&nbsp;km north of the Capricorn line ([[latitude]] of 22 degrees).

He is also signed with [[Insane Championship Wrestling]] (ICW) where he is a former [[ICW World Heavyweight Championship (Scotland)|ICW World Heavyweight Champion]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (2002\u20132006)===\nGrado first got into wrestling in 2002. He trained briefly with Red Lightning, Kid Fite, and [[Drew Galloway]] at British Championship Wrestling. Grado spent 5 years scheme fighting on the streets of Stevenston, where he progressed from a low level scrapper to top man. He then went back to train a few years later with Scottish Wrestling Alliance as they were closer to home. He made his debut for the Scottish Wrestling Alliance (SWA) in 2004, under the [[ring name]] '''Grant Dunbar''', as part of The Lowlanders with Glen Dunbar. They achieved little success, but held the SWA Tag Team Championships on two occasions.\n\n===Insane Championship Wrestling (2012\u20132017)===\nAfter years of wrestling sporadically and performing as lead singer of Scottish metalcore band Prezident Prime, Grado returned to training at SWA, this time with new head trainer [[Big Damo]]. He made a [[Facebook]] video to sell tickets for a Scottish Wrestling Alliance show next to his home town, leading to a promo feud with Jackie Polo which included his first time dancing along to Madonna \"Like a Prayer\". These videos and promos became popular and [[Mark Dallas]] from [[Insane Championship Wrestling]] (ICW) hatched the \"Get Grado Booked\" campaign. During this time, Grado was the subject of a ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary, ''The British Wrestler'', which saw his popularity rise with American stars like [[Sonjay Dutt]] voicing their support.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/video/the-british-wrestler-full-length|title=The British Wrestler \u2013 Full Length|publisher=Vice|accessdate=2014-11-12}}</ref> As part of the Vice documentary, Grado appeared to defeat ICW Heavyweight Champion Red Lightning at Super Smokin' Thunderbowl to win the ICW Heavyweight Championship. The match was later restarted as Red Lightning had his leg under the bottom rope. Red Lightning would go on to retain the title.\n\nDuring the ICW Fringe Tour in 2014, Grado teamed up with [[Colt Cabana]] to face the New Age Kliq (Chris Renfrew and [[BT Gunn]]) and won the first Official ICW Tag Team Championships. Grado and Cabana are known as Irn Jew and on the last night of the tour they lost their Tag Team Champship Belts to The New Age Kliq on 15 November 2015 Fear & Loathing VIII Grado defeated [[Drew Galloway]] to win the ICW World Championship at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SECC]].\n\nAt the fifth annual Square Go on 24 January 2016, Grado lost the ICW World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Renfrew, ending his reign at just two months, the shortest reign in ICW History. At the event he also debuted a new theme, and a new look, coming out to a rock version of \"99 Problems\" replacing his long time theme \"Like A Prayer\", as well as ditching his long time singlet for trunks, and the flannel given to him by [[Mick Foley]] at Fear and Loathing VIII. On 16 April 2017 At Barramania III Grado turned heel for the first time in his career by attacking his longtime friend Sha Samuels and aligning himself with Red Lightning. At Shug's Hoose Party 4 on 30 July he lost to Samuels in a Loser Leaves ICW match forcing Grado to leave ICW.\n\n===Premier British Wrestling (2012 - present)===\nOn 3 November 2012 Grado partnered with JD Bravo in a tag team match against The Coffey Brothers ([[Joe Coffey (wrestler)|Joe Coffey]] & Mark Coffey) with  The Coffey Brothers winning the Match.  On 14 March 2015 Grado teamed with [[Kenny Williams (wrestler)|Kenny Williams]] against Darkside & TJ Rage for the Premier British Wrestling Tag Team Championship. Grado & Williams won the match to become new tag champions.\n\n===Pro Wrestling Elite (2013 - present)===\nGrado won the PWE Elite Rumble there for earning a title shot and the opportunity to name the next event. The next PWE show was called Gradomania. He won the Pro Wrestling Elite Heavyweight Championship from Dave Mastiff at GradoMania.<ref name=\"Grado\"/> He lost the title to Iestyn Rees after Rees cashed in his title shot at PWE Jingle All The Galloway.\n\nIn the last ever PWE show, following the passing of Adrian 'Lionheart' McCallum, Grado was to recapture the title and following a conversation with a fan presented the title to Adrian's mother.\n\n===Independent circuit (2006\u2013present)===\nIn addition to working in [[Insane Championship Wrestling]], Grado also appears for various companies around the UK. He has worked for SWA, PWE, SWE, PBW and Wrestlezone among other companies. At WrestleZone's Aberdeen Anarchy event in the Beach Ballroom in front of a sold out 1,300 crowd, Grado defeated childhood hero [[Scotty 2 Hotty]]. On 27 & 28 July, Grado worked for What Culture Pro Wrestling.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling ===\n====Various storylines (2014\u20132016)====\n[[File:Grado in 2014 (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright|left|Grado in 2014]]\nIn 2014, Grado appeared on the second season of ''[[TNA British Boot Camp]]'' in an ongoing feud with judge [[Al Snow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/comedy-wrestler-grado-lands-big-4087222|title=Comedy wrestler Grado lands his big break after earning a place on US-based TV show British Boot Camp|publisher=Daily Record|accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/tna-british-boot-camp-2-4449388|title=TNA British Boot Camp 2: The 'clown prince of wrestling' Grado tries to impress the judges|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=2014-10-16}}</ref> After missing the second round of the competition due to having lunch and losing track of time, Snow threw Grado out of the competition. Grado would then appear at the Manchester auditions and was once again thrown out. He reappeared in London and with some convincing from [[Gail Kim]], Snow allowed him back into the competition. Snow would then send Sha Samuels to rough up Grado in the second round. He would make it through to the British finals and onto the U.S. finals before finally being eliminated at the Top 6. After Snow eliminated Grado from the competition, Grado challenged Snow to a match at the SSE Hydro as part of TNA's Maximum Impact Tour in January 2015. Snow accepted and Grado went on to win the match, followed by Snow shaking his hand.\n\nGrado appeared at [[Destination X (2015)|Destination X]] on 10 June, having earned another chance in TNA following his victory over Snow. Grado later appeared in several backstage segments, attempting [[parkour]] and trying to lose weight to be able to compete in the [[X Division]]. Only at the weigh-in did [[Jeremy Borash]] inform Grado that \"there are no limits in the X-Division\". Grado would immediately compete against [[Kenny King (wrestler)|Kenny King]] and Cruz, getting the pinfall victory over the latter. Grado fought for the [[TNA X Division Championship]] in a losing effort against [[Low Ki]] and [[Tigre Uno]]. Uno won the match and the title. During October and November (taped in July), Grado went on to participate in the new [[TNA World Title Series]] tournament, where he was placed fourth of his block in Team UK. He failed to win all the matches against [[Drew Galloway]], [[Rockstar Spud]], and [[Bram (wrestler)|Bram]], thus failing to advance to the round of 16 from his block. On the 26 January 2016 edition of Impact Wrestling. Grado competed in the Feast or Fired match and was the first man to grab the briefcase. Unfortunately, later in the broadcast, during the reveal ceremony, the briefcase revealed that Grado contained the pink slip and as a result of that, he was immediately fired from TNA.\n\nOn 9 February 2016, Grado returned to ''Impact Wrestling'' claiming he was screwed and was going to show proof that he was screwed when [[Eli Drake]] arrived with security. His security then chased Grado out the ring, and Drake attempted to attack him only to be assaulted by Grado. Grado escaped through a tunnel. Later in the night, [[Billy Corgan]] was talking about the new UK tour when Grado complained about being screwed. After repeatedly making a rant, security escorted him away. Drake then interrupted Grado and told him \"he better shut up about whatever he thinks he knows\" and then attacked him.<ref name=\"Grado claims he is screwed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/tna-wrestling-results/tna-impact-results/57723-tna-impact-wrestling-results-2-9-16-angle-drew-ii|title=Grado claims he was screwed|last=Boutwell|first=Josh|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Teaming with Shera (2016\u20132017)====\nDuring TNA's Maximum Impact tour of the UK, Grado would make an appearance as a masked wrestler under the guise of '''Odarg the Great''', tagging with [[Mahabali Shera]] against Eli Drake and [[Jessie Godderz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/94634/complete-impact-wrestling-report-new-x-division-champion-crowned-youll-never-guess-who-showed-up-at-impact-angles-mystery-opponent-is-revealed.html?p=1|title=COMPLETE IMPACT WRESTLING REPORT: NEW X DIVISION CHAMPION, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO SHOWED UP, ANGLE'S MYSTERY OPPONENT IS REVEALED | work=PWInsider.com|last=Carapola|first=Stuart|accessdate=24 June 2015|publisher=PWInsider|date=24 June 2015}}</ref> He was billed from \"Parts Unknown\" and used Grado's move set and entrance theme. At [[Lockdown (2016)|Lockdown]], he defeated Eli Drake in a Six Sides of Steel match. Grado would continue appearing during the Maximum Impact 8 tour claiming to have proof that he was \"screwed\" by Eli Drake. A week later, while showing viewers at home a proof for Grado's point of showing Drake peeking into Grado's briefcase, though it could not be seen if Drake indeed switched cases with Grado, the fact Drake opened Grado's case was enough for Grado to receive a contract ladder match against Drake, which he went on to win. Two weeks later, when he started talking to Mahabali Shera about his comeback party, both men were, with no clear reason, brutally attacked by [[Al Snow]]. More than a month after, on the 10 May 2016 episode of ''Impact Wrestling'', Grado returned during a rematch between Snow and Shera, making sure Shera won the match. On the 24 May episode of ''Impact Wrestling'' Grado had a street fight with Snow with Shera at ringside, which he went on to lose after interference by two unknown men. At [[Slammiversary (2016)|Slammiversary]], Grado and Shera were defeated by the two men, who are [[Sylvester Lefort|Basile Baraka]] and [[Marcus Louis|Baron Dax]], also known as [[The Tribunal (professional wrestling)|The Tribunal]]. On 14 June edition of ''Impact Wrestling'', Grado and Mahabali have a four-way tag team match for the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] against The Tribunal, [[The BroMans]] and [[Decay (professional wrestling)|Decay]], in a losing effort. On 28 June edition of ''Impact Wrestling'', Grado, Mahabali Shera and [[Brodus Clay|Tyrus]] defeated Al Snow and The Tribunal.

A week later, while showing viewers at home a proof for Grado's point of showing Drake peeking into Grado's briefcase, though it could not be seen if Drake indeed switched cases with Grado, the fact Drake opened Grado's case was enough for Grado to receive a contract ladder match against Drake, which he went on to win.

Prior to its cityhood in 2010, Bi\u00f1an was the richest [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]] in the Philippines with an annual gross income of \u20b1677 million (US$14.383 million) and net income of \u20b1250 million (US$5.308 million), as of 2007 by the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission On Audit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2007 Financial Statements Highlights for Local Government Units |url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/Reports/RFP/2007FS_Highlights-LGUs.pdf |publisher=Commission On Audit Philippines |format=PDF |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |archivedate=September 20, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920082041/http://www.coa.gov.ph/Reports/RFP/2007FS_Highlights-LGUs.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}}, making it the third largest in population in the province of Laguna, after [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba City]] and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa City]].{{PH census|current}}\n\nBy virtue of Republic Act 10658, signed on March 27, 2015, by [[Benigno Aquino III|President Benigno Aquino III]], Bi\u00f1an has been separated from the [[Legislative districts of Laguna|First Congressional District of Laguna]] and formed the [[Legislative district of Bi\u00f1an|Lone Congressional District of Bi\u00f1an]]. The first representative, the former mayor of the city, has been elected during the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 elections]], unopposed.\n\n==Etymology==\nWhere Bi\u00f1an got its name is a mystery. Some deduced that before [[Juan de Salcedo|Captain Juan de Salcedo]] proceeded to [[Cainta]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] finally reaching [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], he landed in Bi\u00f1an. According to the story, Padres Alfonso de Alvarado and Diego Espinar planted a huge wooden cross on the spot where the present day San Isidro Labrador parish stands and co-celebrated a [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Mass]]. Curious natives gathered and the two Spanish missionaries took advantage of the situation. They baptized each one of them. From then on, old folks say they called the place \u201cBinyagan,\u201d which means a baptismal place. The Spanish tongue's difficulty in pronouncing the local dialect acquired for the once town its name\u2014 \"Bi\u00f1an\".\n\n==Geography==\nBi\u00f1an is located {{convert|35|km}} south of [[Manila]]. It is bounded on the north by San Pedro City on the south by Santa Rosa City and on the west by [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]], [[Cavite]].  On the eastern and northern horizon lies the [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.\n\nThe city covers a total land area of {{convert|43.50|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} that represents 2.5 percent of the entire Laguna province. In 2008, Bi\u00f1an had a total population of 269,608. It is the fourth most populated in the province, (9.8% of the provincial population) next only to Calamba City (12.66%), San Pedro City (11.42%), and Santa Rosa City (9.92%).\n\n===Topography===\nBi\u00f1an is generally plain with 85.33 percent of its total area having a slope of zero to 2.5 percent. This covers all the 24 barangay except for small portions of Barangay Bi\u00f1an and San Francisco having a slope ranging from 2.6 to 25 percent, meaning it is gently sloping to strongly sloping. With more than three-fourths of its area generally level to nearly level, this makes Bi\u00f1an suitable for agricultural and urban development.\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nThe climate of Bi\u00f1an is characterized by two pronounced seasons; dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year. Maximum rainfall occurs from June to September with an annual average rainfall of 200&nbsp;mm. Bi\u00f1an is protected by mountains in the peripheral areas, and thus it is making the area cooler.\n\n===Soil properties===\nOf the eleven soil series that compose the land area of Laguna, Carmona and Gingua series covers about two types that can only be seen in Bi\u00f1an. Carmona series covers about 2,577 hectares or 59.24 seen in Bi\u00f1an's land area. Agricultural land in these areas is primarily devoted to rice and sugar production. Gingua series, on other hand, specifically the fine sandy type covers 315 hectares which is one of the most productive soils in Laguna where a variety of crops especially vegetables are grown profitably.

The following year, January 15 [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Sta Rosa de Lima]] was established and became an independent town.\n\nHistorically, Bi\u00f1an is nationally recognized in the books related to the biography of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], the country's national hero. It was in June 1869 when Jos\u00e9 Rizal as a young boy went to Bi\u00f1an with his brother [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]]. They proceeded to his aunt's house near the town proper where they were to be lodged. Here, his first formal education was entrusted to Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz who after a year and a half of tutelage advised young Rizal to continue higher education in Manila. In honor of Jos\u00e9 Rizal, a plaque of recognition was bestowed on the house where he stayed at. A monument now stands at the center of Bi\u00f1an's plaza in recognition of Bi\u00f1an's affiliation to Rizal.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bi\u00f1an\n| 1903 = 9563\n| 1918 = 10692\n| 1939 = 16238\n| 1948 = 20794\n| 1960 = 33309\n| 1970 = 58290\n| 1975 = 67444\n| 1980 = 83684\n| 1990 = 134553\n| 1995 = 160206\n| 2000 = 201186\n| 2007 = 262735\n| 2008 = 269608\n| 2010 = 283396\n| 2015 = 333028\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nTotal No. of Registered Voters as of August 19, 2008: No. of Precinct: 705 ; No. of RV 114,534;  Total Registered Voters: 114,534.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Church of San Isidro Labrador.jpg|thumb|right|San Isidro Labrador Parish Church, located at the downtown city plaza of Barangay Poblacion.]]\n\nThe majority of the people are Roman Catholics.

The first representative, the former mayor of the city, has been elected during the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 elections]], unopposed.\n\n==Etymology==\nWhere Bi\u00f1an got its name is a mystery. Some deduced that before [[Juan de Salcedo|Captain Juan de Salcedo]] proceeded to [[Cainta]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] finally reaching [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], he landed in Bi\u00f1an. According to the story, Padres Alfonso de Alvarado and Diego Espinar planted a huge wooden cross on the spot where the present day San Isidro Labrador parish stands and co-celebrated a [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Mass]]. Curious natives gathered and the two Spanish missionaries took advantage of the situation. They baptized each one of them. From then on, old folks say they called the place \u201cBinyagan,\u201d which means a baptismal place. The Spanish tongue's difficulty in pronouncing the local dialect acquired for the once town its name\u2014 \"Bi\u00f1an\".\n\n==Geography==\nBi\u00f1an is located {{convert|35|km}} south of [[Manila]]. It is bounded on the north by San Pedro City on the south by Santa Rosa City and on the west by [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]], [[Cavite]].  On the eastern and northern horizon lies the [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.\n\nThe city covers a total land area of {{convert|43.50|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} that represents 2.5 percent of the entire Laguna province. In 2008, Bi\u00f1an had a total population of 269,608. It is the fourth most populated in the province, (9.8% of the provincial population) next only to Calamba City (12.66%), San Pedro City (11.42%), and Santa Rosa City (9.92%).\n\n===Topography===\nBi\u00f1an is generally plain with 85.33 percent of its total area having a slope of zero to 2.5 percent. This covers all the 24 barangay except for small portions of Barangay Bi\u00f1an and San Francisco having a slope ranging from 2.6 to 25 percent, meaning it is gently sloping to strongly sloping. With more than three-fourths of its area generally level to nearly level, this makes Bi\u00f1an suitable for agricultural and urban development.\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nThe climate of Bi\u00f1an is characterized by two pronounced seasons; dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year. Maximum rainfall occurs from June to September with an annual average rainfall of 200&nbsp;mm. Bi\u00f1an is protected by mountains in the peripheral areas, and thus it is making the area cooler.\n\n===Soil properties===\nOf the eleven soil series that compose the land area of Laguna, Carmona and Gingua series covers about two types that can only be seen in Bi\u00f1an. Carmona series covers about 2,577 hectares or 59.24 seen in Bi\u00f1an's land area. Agricultural land in these areas is primarily devoted to rice and sugar production. Gingua series, on other hand, specifically the fine sandy type covers 315 hectares which is one of the most productive soils in Laguna where a variety of crops especially vegetables are grown profitably.

The following year, January 15 [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Sta Rosa de Lima]] was established and became an independent town.\n\nHistorically, Bi\u00f1an is nationally recognized in the books related to the biography of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], the country's national hero. It was in June 1869 when Jos\u00e9 Rizal as a young boy went to Bi\u00f1an with his brother [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]]. They proceeded to his aunt's house near the town proper where they were to be lodged. Here, his first formal education was entrusted to Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz who after a year and a half of tutelage advised young Rizal to continue higher education in Manila. In honor of Jos\u00e9 Rizal, a plaque of recognition was bestowed on the house where he stayed at. A monument now stands at the center of Bi\u00f1an's plaza in recognition of Bi\u00f1an's affiliation to Rizal.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bi\u00f1an\n| 1903 = 9563\n| 1918 = 10692\n| 1939 = 16238\n| 1948 = 20794\n| 1960 = 33309\n| 1970 = 58290\n| 1975 = 67444\n| 1980 = 83684\n| 1990 = 134553\n| 1995 = 160206\n| 2000 = 201186\n| 2007 = 262735\n| 2008 = 269608\n| 2010 = 283396\n| 2015 = 333028\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nTotal No. of Registered Voters as of August 19, 2008: No. of Precinct: 705 ; No. of RV 114,534;  Total Registered Voters: 114,534.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Church of San Isidro Labrador.jpg|250px|thumb|right|San Isidro Labrador Parish Church, located at the downtown city plaza of Barangay Poblacion.]]\n\nThe majority of the people are Roman Catholics.

On August 1, 2016, the City Government of Bi\u00f1an opened the School of Rizal Site and Museum to the public after its acquisition from the Gonzales Family in 2015.\n\n===''Araw ng Bi\u00f1an''===\nThe three-day ''Araw ng Bi\u00f1an'', commemorates the cityhood anniversary (February 2), Bi\u00f1an's liberation day from the [[Japanese Imperial Forces]] (February 3), and the remembrance of the founding anniversary of Bi\u00f1an (February 5).\n\n===Bi\u00f1an ''Puto Latik'' Festival===\nHappening every first week of February since 2011, the ''Puto Latik'' Festival is to commemorate the Puto Bi\u00f1an, which is Bi\u00f1an's rice cake delicacy, and the [[Maglalatik]] traditional dance that originated from Bi\u00f1an. However, beginning 2017, it shall be celebrated every May 15\u201323, because of the Maglalatik's historical significance to the celebration of [[Isidore the Laborer|San Isidro Labrador's]] feast day, the city's patron saint.\n\n== Notable people ==\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n* [[Ronnie Alonte]], actor, singer, dancer, ''[[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]'', Hashtags member\n* [[Ken Chan (Filipino actor)|Ken Chan]], Filipino-Chinese actor from Laguna\n* [[Zephanie Dimaranan]], first grand winner of [[Idol Philippines]]<ref name=\"ABS-CBN-Zephanie\">{{cite news |last1=Bardinas |first1=Mary Ann |title=How the young, delicate Zephanie Dimaranan\u2019s past rejections turn her into a fierce contender on Idol Philippines |url=https://entertainment.abs-cbn.com/tv/shows/idolphilippines/show-updates/2019/07/25/06072519-how-zephanie-dimaranans-past-rejections-turn-her-into-a-fierce-idol-ph-contender |accessdate=28 July 2019 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=25 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ABS-CBNNews-Zephanie\">{{cite news |title=Zephanie Dimaranan named 'Idol Philippines' grand winner |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/07/28/19/zephanie-dimaranan-named-idol-philippines-grand-winner |accessdate=28 July 2019 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=28 July 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Barbie Forteza]], actress from Laguna, she is best known for her role in [[Pilyang Kerubin]], [[Stairway to Heaven (Philippine TV series)|Stairaway to Heaven]], [[Meant to Be (TV series)|Meant to Be]] and [[Inday Will Always Love You]]\n* [[Rose Ann Gonzales]], multi-awarded former child actress now works for Congresswoman Len Alonte-Naguiat's Congressional Office\n* [[Koreen Medina]], ''Starstruck'' avenger, actress, Mutya ng Pilipinas 2013 Asia-Pacific\n* [[Precious Lara Quigaman]], actress, [[Miss International]] 2005\n* [[Marco Sison]], OPM icon, singer, recording artist, former councilor from Bi\u00f1an, Laguna\n* [[Led Sobrepe\u00f1a III]], actor, singer, former singer of [[The Singing Bee (Philippine game show)|The Singing Bee]]\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n\n==Sister Cities==\n;Local\n*[[Cabuyao, Laguna|Cabuyao]], Laguna{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n*[[Makati City]], [[Metro Manila]]{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{Commons category|Bi\u00f1an}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Binan}}<!-- * [http://www.binan.ph/ Official Website of the City of Bi\u00f1an Laguna] -->\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120523035240/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=6&frmIdProvince=36&frmIdLgu=682 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre    = Bi\u00f1an\n| North     = [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]]\n| Northeast = ''[[Laguna de Bay]]''\n| Southeast = [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]]\n| Southwest = [[Silang, Cavite]]\n| West      = [[General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite]]<br />[[Carmona, Cavite]]\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Articles Related to Bi\u00f1an\n| list  = \n{{Laguna}}\n{{Philippine cities}}\n{{CALABARZON}}\n{{Most populous cities in Philippines}}}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binan}}\n[[Category:Bi\u00f1an| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Laguna (province)]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1688]]\n[[Category:1688 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay]]\n", "name_user": "P199", "label": "safe", "comment": "map formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi%C3%B1an"}
