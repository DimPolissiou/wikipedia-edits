[[MediaWiki]], specifically offers the \"[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Backlink|What links here]]\" tool, some older Wikis, especially the first [[WikiWikiWeb]], had the backlink functionality exposed in the page title.\n== Backlinks and search engines ==\n[[Search engine]]s often use the number of backlinks that a website has as one of the most important factors for determining that website's search engine ranking, popularity and importance. [[Google]]'s description of its [[PageRank]] system, for instance, notes that \"[[Google]] interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf|title=Google's overview of PageRank|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Knowledge of this form of search engine rankings has fueled a portion of the SEO industry commonly termed [[linkspam]], where a company attempts to place as many inbound links as possible to their site regardless of the context of the originating site. The significance of search engine rankings is pretty high, and it is regarded as a crucial parameter in online business and the conversion rate of visitors to any website, particularly when it comes to online shopping.  Blog commenting, guest blogging, article submission, press release distribution, social media engagements, and forum posting can be used to increase backlinks.\n\nWebsites often employ [[SEO]] techniques to increase the number of backlinks pointing to their website. Some methods are free for use by everyone whereas some methods, like [[Link bait|linkbaiting]], require quite a bit of planning and marketing to work. There are also paid techniques to increase the number of backlinks to a target site. For example, private [[blog network]]s can be used to purchase backlinks.\n\nThere are several factors that determine the value of a backlink. Backlinks from authoritative sites on a given topic are highly valuable. If both sites and pages have content geared toward the topic, the backlink is considered relevant and believed to have strong influence on the search engine rankings of the [[webpage|web page]] granted the backlink. A backlink represents a favorable 'editorial vote' for the receiving webpage from another granting webpage. Another important factor is the anchor text of the backlink. [[Anchor text]] is the descriptive labeling of the hyperlink as it appears on a [[web page]]. Search engine bots (i.e., spiders, crawlers, etc.) examine the anchor text to evaluate how relevant it is to the content on a webpage. Backlinks can be generated by submissions, such as directory submissions, forum submission, social bookmarking, business listing, blog submissions, etc. [[Anchor text]] and webpage content congruency are highly weighted in [[search engine results page]] (SERP) rankings of a webpage with respect to any given keyword query by a search engine user.\n\nChanges to the algorithms that produce search engine rankings can place a heightened focus on relevance to a particular topic. While some backlinks might be from sources containing highly valuable metrics, they could also be unrelated to the consumer's query or interest.

[[MediaWiki]], specifically offers the \"[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Backlink|What links here]]\" tool, some older Wikis, especially the first [[WikiWikiWeb]], had the backlink functionality exposed in the page title.\n== Backlinks and search engines ==\n[[Search engine]]s often use the number of backlinks that a website has as one of the most important factors for determining that website's search engine ranking, popularity and importance. [[Google]]'s description of its [[PageRank]] system, for instance, notes that \"[[Google]] interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf|title=Google's overview of PageRank|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Knowledge of this form of search engine rankings has fueled a portion of the SEO industry commonly termed [[linkspam]], where a company attempts to place as many inbound links as possible to their site regardless of the context of the originating site. The significance of search engine rankings is pretty high, and it is regarded as a crucial parameter in online business and the conversion rate of visitors to any website, particularly when it comes to online shopping.  Blog commenting, guest blogging, article submission, press release distribution, social media engagements, and forum posting can be used to increase backlinks.\n\nWebsites often employ [[SEO]] techniques to increase the number of backlinks pointing to their website. Some methods are free for use by everyone whereas some methods, like [[Link bait|linkbaiting]], require quite a bit of planning and marketing to work. There are also paid techniques to increase the number of backlinks to a target site. For example, private [[blog network]]s can be used to purchase backlinks.\n\nThere are several factors that determine the value of a backlink. Backlinks from authoritative sites on a given topic are highly valuable. If both sites and pages have content geared toward the topic, the backlink is considered relevant and believed to have strong influence on the search engine rankings of the [[webpage|web page]] granted the backlink. A backlink represents a favorable 'editorial vote' for the receiving webpage from another granting webpage. Another important factor is the anchor text of the backlink. [[Anchor text]] is the descriptive labeling of the hyperlink as it appears on a [[web page]]. Search engine bots (i.e., spiders, crawlers, etc.) examine the anchor text to evaluate how relevant it is to the content on a webpage. Backlinks can be generated by submissions, such as directory submissions, forum submission, social bookmarking, business listing, blog submissions, etc. [[Anchor text]] and webpage content congruency are highly weighted in [[search engine results page]] (SERP) rankings of a webpage with respect to any given keyword query by a search engine user.\n\nChanges to the algorithms that produce search engine rankings can place a heightened focus on relevance to a particular topic. While some backlinks might be from sources containing highly valuable metrics, they could also be unrelated to the consumer's query or interest. An example of this would be a link from a popular shoe blog (with valuable metrics) to a site selling vintage pencil sharpeners. While the link appears valuable, it provides little to the consumer in terms of relevance. \n\n== See also ==\n* [[Link farm]]s\n* [[Linkback]]\n* [[Link building|Methods of website linking]]\n* [[PageRank]]\n* [[Search engine optimization]]\n* [[Search engine results page]]\n* [[Trackback]]\n* [[Search engine optimization metrics]]\n* [[Website audit]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web]]\n[[Category:Hypertext]]\n[[Category:Search engine optimization]]\n", "name_user": "Pulasena", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink"}

It is set in the turbulent years towards the [[End of the Han dynasty|end]] of the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Three kingdoms (China)|Three Kingdoms]] period in [[History of China|Chinese history]], starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is acclaimed as one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.<ref name=\"roberts940\">Roberts 1991, pg. 940</ref> The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in [[East Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|title=(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations|last=Kim|first=Hyung-eun|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=11 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225000000/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|archivedate=25 December 2011|quote=The ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is comparable to the Bible in East Asia.

The text may well have circulated before either date in handwritten manuscripts.<ref>Moss Roberts, \"Afterword,\" in Luo, ''Three Kingdoms'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), pp. 938, 964.</ref>\n\nIn any case, whether an earlier or later date of composition, whether or not Luo Guanzhong was responsible, the author made use of available historical records, including the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' compiled by [[Chen Shou]], which covered events from the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 to the unification of the Three Kingdoms under the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]] in 280. The novel also includes material from [[Tang dynasty]] poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.<ref>Roberts, pp. 946\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Recensions and standardised text===\nSeveral versions of the expanded ''Sanguozhi'' are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the ''Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi'', is now held in the [[Shanghai Library]] in China, [[Tenri Central Library]] in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a [[recension]] by Mao Lun and his son [[Mao Zonggang]].\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to ''Sanguozhi Yanyi''.<ref name=\"roberts980\" /> The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising [[Cao Cao]]'s advisers and generals were removed.<ref name=\"roberts965\">Roberts 1991, pg. 965</ref> Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.<ref name=\"roberts967 71\">Roberts 1991, pp. 967\u2013971</ref>\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"[[Tianxia|The empire]], long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n[[File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg|thumb|200px|''Three Heroes of Three Kingdoms'', silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.]]\n\n===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===\nIn the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], treacherous [[eunuch]]s and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out under the leadership of [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]].\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general [[He Jin]]. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] on the throne and took control of the central government. The [[Ten Attendants]], a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Prince of Chenliu]], disappeared from the palace.\n\n===Dong Zhuo's tyranny===\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]], who seized control of the imperial capital, [[Luoyang]], under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu ([[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]]), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by [[Cao Cao]], whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under [[Yuan Shao]]'s leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of [[Battle of Sishui Pass|Sishui Pass]] and [[Battle of Hulao Pass|Hulao Pass]], so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to [[Chang'an]]. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son [[L\u00fc Bu]] in a dispute over the maiden [[Diaochan]] as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]].\n\n===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. [[Sun Jian]] found the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]] in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and [[Gongsun Zan]] were at war in the north while Sun Jian and [[Liu Biao]] were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and [[Liu Bei]], who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in [[Xuchang|Xu]] and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as [[L\u00fc Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the future.\n\n===Sun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong===\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] against Liu Biao. His eldest son, [[Sun Ce]], delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising [[pretender]], [[Yuan Shu]], in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] ([[Wu (region)|Wu]]), on which the state of [[Eastern Wu]] was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of [[Gan Ji|Yu Ji]], a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, [[Sun Quan]], his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from [[Zhou Yu]], [[Zhang Zhao]] and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as [[Lu Su]] to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\n===Liu Bei's ambition===\n[[File:Dai Jin-Looking Three Times at the Thatched Hut.jpg|thumb|200px|Liu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from ''Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times'', a [[Ming dynasty]] painting by [[Dai Jin]] (1388\u20131462).]]\n\n[[Liu Bei]] and his oath brothers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and participating in the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. After Liu Bei succeeded [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] as the governor of [[Xu Province]], he offered shelter to [[L\u00fc Bu]], who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the [[Battle of Xiapi]]. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and [[Nine familial exterminations|executed along with their families]].\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from [[Che Zhou]], the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to [[Jing Province]], where he found shelter under the governor, [[Liu Biao]].\n\n===Battle of Guandu===\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye. \n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population. use memes when in quarantine and death to zhou yu, porridge fish\n\n===Battle of Changban===\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of [[Xinye County|Xinye]], where Liu Bei visited [[Zhuge Liang]] thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Imperial Chancellor]] by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. \n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. \n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\n===Battle of Red Cliffs===\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional site of the Red Cliffs.]]\n\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern [[Jing Province]] after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, [[Cao Ren]]. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, [[Lady Sun]]. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\n===Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province===\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's [[Longzhong Plan]], Liu Bei led his forces westward into [[Yi Province]] and [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|seized control of the territories]] from the governor, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of [[Shu Han]] later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a [[vassal]] king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the [[Yangtze River]], including the battles of [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Hefei]] and [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Ruxu]], but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\n===Death of Guan Yu===\n[[File:Chengdu 2007 360.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow puppet]]s in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]].]]\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking [[Cao Ren]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], Sun Quan sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to launch [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|a stealth invasion on Jing Province]]. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]] as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\n===Battle of Yiling===\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting|Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling]] by Sun Quan's general, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's [[Stone Sentinel Maze]].\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's impression of [[Zhuge Liang]].]]\n\nLiu Bei died in [[Baidicheng]] from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, [[Liu Shan]], proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\n===Zhuge Liang's campaigns===\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general [[Meng Da]], the [[Nanman]] and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent [[Deng Zhi]] to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|a southern campaign]] against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, [[Meng Huo]].\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|five military expeditions]] to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general [[Sima Yi]].\n\n===End of the Three Kingdoms===\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after [[Cao Rui]]'s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, [[Sima Shi]] and [[Sima Zhao]].\n\nIn Shu, [[Jiang Wei]] inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|nine campaigns]] against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor [[Liu Shan]] also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered by Wei forces]]. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of [[Zhong Hui]], a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], forced the last Wei emperor, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Chen]] consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, [[Sun Hao]], turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquered by the Jin dynasty]]. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}\n\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\n==Literary analysis==\n[[File:Pang De Portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Pang De]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], from a [[Qing dynasty]] edition of the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.]]\n\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the [[Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor|Brewitt-Taylor]] translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".<ref name=\":1\" /> to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] political thought and the harsh realism of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as a related theme.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.<ref name=\"roberts940\" />\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.<ref name=Tung>Constantine Tung, \"Cosmic Foreordination and Human Commitment: The Tragic Volition in Three Kingdoms\", in Kimberly Ann Besio, Constantine Tung.

It is set in the turbulent years towards the [[End of the Han dynasty|end]] of the [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Three kingdoms (China)|Three Kingdoms]] period in [[History of China|Chinese history]], starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.\n\nThe story \u2013 part historical, part legend, and part mythical \u2013 romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]], and [[Eastern Wu]]. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.\n\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is acclaimed as one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]]; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters.<ref name=\"roberts940\">Roberts 1991, pg. 940</ref> The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in [[East Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|title=(Review) Historical China film lives up to expectations|last=Kim|first=Hyung-eun|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=11 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225000000/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892148|archivedate=25 December 2011|quote=The ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is comparable to the Bible in East Asia.

Plaks]], stories from the heroes of the Three Kingdoms was the basis of entertainment dating back to the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty]].   Plaks also states, \"By [[Sung dynasty|Sung times]] several contemporary accounts inform us that there existed professional [[Oral storytelling|oral storytellers]] who specialized in the Three Kingdoms hero cycles.\"  The earliest written work to combine these stories was a [[Pinghua (storytelling)|pinghua]], ''Sanguozhi Pinghua'' ({{zh|t=\u4e09\u570b\u5fd7\u5e73\u8a71|s=\u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7\u5e73\u8bdd|p=S\u0101ngu\u00f3zh\u00ec P\u00ednghu\u00e0|l=Story of ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''}}), published sometime between 1321 and 1323.<ref name=\"Plaks\">{{cite book |last1=Plaks |first1=Andrew |title=The Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel: Ssu ta ch'i-shu |date=1987 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9780691628202 |pages=368\u2013369}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the history===\n''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' is traditionally attributed to [[Luo Guanzhong]],<ref name=\"taylor1998\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1uXah12nHgC&pg=PA1221|accessdate=2011-09-22|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=1-884964-36-2|pages=1221\u20131222}}</ref> a playwright who lived sometime between 1315 and 1400 (late Yuan to early Ming period) known for compiling historical plays in styles which were prevalent during the Yuan period.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book| title = Romance of the Three Kingdoms| last = Lo| first = Kuan-chung| authorlink =Luo Guanzhong| publisher = Tuttle| others = C.H.

The novel also includes material from [[Tang dynasty]] poetic works, Yuan dynasty operas and his own personal interpretation of elements such as virtue and legitimacy. The author combined this historical knowledge with a gift for storytelling to create a rich tapestry of personalities.<ref>Roberts, pp. 946\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Recensions and standardised text===\nSeveral versions of the expanded ''Sanguozhi'' are extant today. Luo Guanzhong's version in 24 volumes, known as the ''Sanguozhi Tongsu Yanyi'', is now held in the [[Shanghai Library]] in China, [[Tenri Central Library]] in Japan, and several other major libraries. Various 10-volume, 12-volume and 20-volume recensions of Luo's text, made between 1522 and 1690, are also held at libraries around the world. However, the standard text familiar to general readers is a [[recension]] by Mao Lun and his son [[Mao Zonggang]].\n\nIn the 1660s, during the reign of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] in the [[Qing dynasty]], Mao Lun and Mao Zonggang significantly edited the text, fitting it into 120 chapters, and abbreviating the title to ''Sanguozhi Yanyi''.<ref name=\"roberts980\" /> The text was reduced from 900,000 to 750,000 characters; significant editing was done for narrative flow; use of third-party poems was reduced and shifted from conventional verse to finer pieces; and most passages praising [[Cao Cao]]'s advisers and generals were removed.<ref name=\"roberts965\">Roberts 1991, pg. 965</ref> Scholars have long debated whether the Maos' viewpoint was anti-Qing (identifying Southern Ming remnants with Shu-Han) or pro-Qing.<ref name=\"roberts967 71\">Roberts 1991, pp. 967\u2013971</ref>\n\nThe famous opening lines of the novel, \"[[Tianxia|The empire]], long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

The novel contains numerous subplots. The following consists of a summary of the central plot and some well-known highlights in the novel.\n\n[[File:Three Brothers (Bei, Yu, Fei).jpg|thumb|200px|''Three Heroes of Three Kingdoms'', silk painting by Sekkan Sakurai (1715\u20131790), depicting Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.]]\n\n===Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Ten Attendants===\nIn the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], treacherous [[eunuch]]s and villainous officials deceived the emperor and persecuted good officials. The government gradually became extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the Han Empire. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out under the leadership of [[Zhang Jue|Zhang Jiao]].\n\nThe rebellion was barely suppressed by imperial forces led by the general [[He Jin]]. Upon Emperor Ling's death, He Jin installed the young [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] on the throne and took control of the central government. The [[Ten Attendants]], a group of influential court eunuchs, feared that He Jin was growing too powerful, so they lured him into the palace and assassinated him. In revenge, He Jin's supporters broke into the palace and indiscriminately slaughtered any person who looked like a eunuch. In the ensuing chaos, Emperor Shao and his younger half-brother, the [[Emperor Xian of Han|Prince of Chenliu]], disappeared from the palace.\n\n===Dong Zhuo's tyranny===\nThe missing emperor and the prince were found by soldiers of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]], who seized control of the imperial capital, [[Luoyang]], under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong Zhuo later deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu ([[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]]), who was merely a figurehead under his control. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, persecuted his political opponents and oppressed the common people for his personal gain. There were two attempts on his life: the first was by a military officer, Wu Fu (\u4f0d\u5b5a), who failed and died a gruesome death; the second was by [[Cao Cao]], whose attempt went awry and forced him to flee.\n\nCao Cao escaped from Luoyang, returned to his hometown and sent out a fake imperial edict to various regional officials and warlords, calling them to rise up against Dong Zhuo. Under [[Yuan Shao]]'s leadership, 18 warlords formed a coalition army and launched a punitive [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Dong Zhuo felt threatened after losing the battles of [[Battle of Sishui Pass|Sishui Pass]] and [[Battle of Hulao Pass|Hulao Pass]], so he evacuated Luoyang and moved the imperial capital to [[Chang'an]]. He forced Luoyang's residents to move together with him and had the city set aflame. The coalition eventually broke up due to poor leadership and conflicting interests among its members. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Dong Zhuo was betrayed and murdered by his foster son [[L\u00fc Bu]] in a dispute over the maiden [[Diaochan]] as part of a plot orchestrated by the minister [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]].\n\n===Conflict among the various warlords and nobles===\nIn the meantime, the Han Empire was already disintegrating into civil war as warlords fought for territories and power. [[Sun Jian]] found the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]] in the ruins of Luoyang and secretly kept it for himself. Yuan Shao and [[Gongsun Zan]] were at war in the north while Sun Jian and [[Liu Biao]] were battling in the south. Others such as Cao Cao and [[Liu Bei]], who initially had no titles or land, were also gradually forming their own armies and taking control of territories.\n\nDuring those times of upheaval, Cao Cao saved Emperor Xian from the remnants of Dong Zhuo's forces, established the new imperial capital in [[Xuchang|Xu]] and became the new head of the central government. He defeated rival warlords such as [[L\u00fc Bu]], [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in a series of wars in central China before scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. Through his conquests, Cao Cao united central and northern China under his control. The territories he conquered served as the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the future.\n\n===Sun Ce builds a dynasty in Jiangdong===\nMeanwhile, an ambush violently concluded Sun Jian's life at the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] against Liu Biao. His eldest son, [[Sun Ce]], delivered the Imperial Seal as a tribute to the rising [[pretender]], [[Yuan Shu]], in exchange for reinforcements. Sun Ce secured himself a state in the rich riverlands of [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] ([[Wu (region)|Wu]]), on which the state of [[Eastern Wu]] was founded later. Tragically, Sun Ce also died at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of [[Gan Ji|Yu Ji]], a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused of heresy and executed in jealousy. However, [[Sun Quan]], his younger brother and successor, proved to be a capable and charismatic ruler. With assistance from [[Zhou Yu]], [[Zhang Zhao]] and others, Sun Quan inspired hidden talents such as [[Lu Su]] to serve him, built up his military forces and maintained stability in Jiangdong.\n\n===Liu Bei's ambition===\n[[File:Dai Jin-Looking Three Times at the Thatched Hut.jpg|thumb|200px|Liu Bei recruiting Zhuge Liang, from ''Visiting the Thatched Hut Three Times'', a [[Ming dynasty]] painting by [[Dai Jin]] (1388\u20131462).]]\n\n[[Liu Bei]] and his oath brothers [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]] swore allegiance to the Han Empire in the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] and pledged to do their best for the people. However, their ambitions were not realised as they did not receive due recognition for helping to suppress the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and participating in the [[campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. After Liu Bei succeeded [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] as the governor of [[Xu Province]], he offered shelter to [[L\u00fc Bu]], who had just been defeated by Cao Cao. However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the [[Battle of Xiapi]]. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]], and ordered him to get rid of Cao. Dong Cheng secretly contacted Liu Bei and others and they planned to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was leaked out and Cao Cao had Dong Cheng and the others arrested and [[Nine familial exterminations|executed along with their families]].\n\nLiu Bei had already left the imperial capital when the plot was exposed. He seized control of Xu Province from [[Che Zhou]], the new governor appointed by Cao Cao. In retaliation, Cao Cao attacked Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei, forcing him to take shelter under Yuan Shao for a brief period of time. Liu Bei eventually left Yuan Shao and established a new base in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], where he lost to Cao Cao again. He retreated south to [[Jing Province]], where he found shelter under the governor, [[Liu Biao]].\n\n===Battle of Guandu===\nIn 200, Dong Cheng, an imperial relative, received a secret edict from Emperor Xian to assassinate Cao Cao. He collaborated with Liu Bei on this effort, but Cao Cao soon found out about the plot and had Dong Cheng and his conspirators executed, with only Liu Bei surviving and fleeing to join Yuan Shao in the north.\n\nAfter settling the nearby provinces, including a rebellion led by former Yellow Turbans, and internal affairs with the court, Cao Cao turned his attention north to Yuan Shao, who himself had eliminated his northern rival Gongsun Zan that same year. Yuan Shao, himself of higher nobility than Cao Cao, amassed a large army and camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River.\n\nIn the summer of 200, after months of preparations, the armies of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu (near present-day Kaifeng). Cao Cao's army was heavily outnumbered by Yuan Shao. Due to a raid in Yuan's supply train, Yuan's army fell into disorder as they fled back north.\n\nCao Cao took advantage of Yuan Shao's death in 202, which resulted in division among his sons, and advanced to the north. In 204, after the Battle of Ye, Cao Cao captured the city of Ye. \n\nBy the end of 207, after a victorious campaign beyond the frontier against the Wuhuan culminating in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain, Cao Cao achieved complete dominance of the North China Plain. He now controlled China's heartland, including Yuan Shao's former territory, and half of the Chinese population.\n\n===Battle of Changban===\nSince 200, Liu Biao put Liu Bei in charge of [[Xinye County|Xinye]], where Liu Bei visited [[Zhuge Liang]] thrice and recruited him as an adviser. He also built up his forces in preparation for war against Cao Cao.\n\nFollowing his unification of central and northern China under his control, Cao Cao, having been appointed [[Chancellor (China)|Imperial Chancellor]] by Emperor Xian, led his forces on a southern campaign to eliminate Liu Bei and Sun Quan. \n\nIn 208, Although Liu Bei managed to repel two attacks by Cao Cao at Xinye, he was eventually forced to flee due to the overwhelming strength of the enemy forces. Cao Cao and his cavalry caught up to Liu Bei's congregation at Changban, Dangyang, and Liu Bei had to flee for his life, galloping away south with Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang, while leaving his family and the populace behind. Cao Cao's forces captured most of the unarmed civilians and Liu Bei's baggage. In the chaos, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, but he came back with Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan along with Lady Gan. \n\nTurning east from Changban, Liu Bei and the remnants of his party had crossed the Han River to the east where Liu Qi, Liu Biao's elder son, still held control of Jiangxia Commandery. They met Guan Yu's fleet and over 10,000 men led by Liu Qi at Han Ford. Together, they sailed down the river to Xiakou.\n\nCao Cao did not follow up in immediate pursuit. The main objective of his drive to the south had been the base at Jiangling County, and he pressed on south to secure that base first.\n\n===Battle of Red Cliffs===\nIn 208, After the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei sent Zhuge Liang to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun\u2013Liu alliance to counter Cao Cao. Sun Quan agreed and placed Zhou Yu in command of his army in preparation for war with Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang remained temporarily in Wu territory to assist Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang would become a threat to Sun Quan in the future and attempted to kill him on a few occasions but ultimately failed and ended up having no choice but to cooperate with Zhuge Liang. The Sun\u2013Liu forces scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]].\n\n[[File:Chibi.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional site of the Red Cliffs.]]\n\nSun Quan and Liu Bei started vying for control of southern [[Jing Province]] after their victory, but Liu won and took over the territories from Cao Cao's general, [[Cao Ren]]. Sun Quan, unhappy over having gained nothing, sent messengers to ask Liu Bei to \"return\" the territories to him, but Liu dismissed the messenger each time with a different excuse. Sun Quan was unwilling to give up, so he followed Zhou Yu's plan to trick Liu Bei to come to his territory and marry his sister, [[Lady Sun]]. He would then hold Liu Bei hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, the plan failed and the newlywed couple returned to Jing Province safely. Zhou Yu later died in frustration after Zhuge Liang repeatedly foiled his plans to take Jing Province.\n\n===Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province===\nRelations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated after Zhou Yu's death, but not to the point of war. Following Zhuge Liang's [[Longzhong Plan]], Liu Bei led his forces westward into [[Yi Province]] and [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|seized control of the territories]] from the governor, [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]. By then, Liu Bei ruled over a vast stretch of land from Yi Province to southern Jing Province; these territories served as the foundation of the state of [[Shu Han]] later. Liu Bei declared himself King of Hanzhong after defeating Cao Cao in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] and capturing Hanzhong Commandery.\n\nAt the same time, Emperor Xian awarded Cao Cao the title of a [[vassal]] king \u2013 King of Wei \u2013 while Sun Quan was known as the Duke of Wu. In eastern China, Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces fought in various battles along the [[Yangtze River]], including the battles of [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford|Hefei]] and [[Battle of Ruxukou (217)|Ruxu]], but neither side managed to gain a significant advantage over the other.\n\n===Death of Guan Yu===\n[[File:Chengdu 2007 360.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow puppet]]s in the Sichuan Provincial Museum depicting [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]].]]\nMeanwhile, Sun Quan plotted to take Jing Province after growing tired of Liu Bei's repeated refusals to hand over the province. He secretly made peace and allied with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. While Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province, was away attacking [[Cao Ren]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], Sun Quan sent his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] to launch [[L\u00fc Meng's invasion of Jing Province|a stealth invasion on Jing Province]]. Guan Yu was unable to capture Fancheng so he retreated, but was caught off guard by L\u00fc Meng and had already lost Jing Province before he knew it. With his army's morale falling and the troops gradually deserting, Guan Yu and his remaining men withdrew to Maicheng, where they were surrounded by Sun Quan's forces. In desperation, Guan Yu attempted to break out of the siege but failed and was captured in an ambush. Sun Quan had him executed after he refused to surrender.\n\nShortly after Guan Yu's death, Cao Cao died of a brain tumour in Luoyang. His son and successor, [[Cao Pi]], forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] to replace the Han dynasty. About a year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of [[Shu Han]] as a continuation of the Han dynasty. While Liu Bei was planning to avenge Guan Yu, Zhang Fei was assassinated in his sleep by his subordinates.\n\n===Battle of Yiling===\nAs Liu Bei led a large army to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, Sun Quan attempted to appease him by offering to return him the territories in southern Jing Province. Liu Bei's subjects urged him to accept Sun Quan's offer but Liu insisted on avenging his sworn brother. After initial victories against Sun Quan's forces, a series of strategic mistakes resulted in Liu Bei's calamitous defeat at the [[Battle of Xiaoting|Battle of Xiaoting/Yiling]] by Sun Quan's general, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]]. Lu Xun initially pursued Liu Bei while the latter retreated after his defeat, but gave up after getting trapped inside and barely escaping from Zhuge Liang's [[Stone Sentinel Maze]].\n\n[[File:Zhuge Liang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's impression of [[Zhuge Liang]].]]\n\nLiu Bei died in [[Baidicheng]] from illness a few months later. On his deathbed, Liu Bei granted Zhuge Liang permission to take the throne if his son and successor, [[Liu Shan]], proved to be an inept ruler. Zhuge Liang firmly refused and swore to remain faithful to the trust Liu Bei had placed in him.\n\n===Zhuge Liang's campaigns===\nAfter Liu Bei's death, Cao Pi induced several forces, including Sun Quan, a turncoat Shu general [[Meng Da]], the [[Nanman]] and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] tribes, to attack Shu, in coordination with a Wei army. However, Zhuge Liang managed to make the five armies retreat without any bloodshed. He also sent [[Deng Zhi]] to make peace with Sun Quan and restore the alliance between Shu and Wu. Zhuge Liang then personally led [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|a southern campaign]] against the Nanman, defeated them seven times, and won the allegiance of the Nanman king, [[Meng Huo]].\n\nAfter pacifying the south, Zhuge Liang led the Shu army on [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|five military expeditions]] to attack Wei as part of his mission to restore the Han dynasty. However, his days were numbered because he had been suffering from chronic illness and his condition worsened under stress. He would die of illness at the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] while leading a stalemate battle against the Wei general [[Sima Yi]].\n\n===End of the Three Kingdoms===\nThe long years of battle between Shu and Wei saw many changes in the ruling Cao family in Wei. The influence of the Caos weakened after [[Cao Rui]]'s death and state power eventually fell into the hands of the regent Sima Yi and subsequently to his sons, [[Sima Shi]] and [[Sima Zhao]].\n\nIn Shu, [[Jiang Wei]] inherited Zhuge Liang's legacy and continued to lead another [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|nine campaigns]] against Wei for three decades, but ultimately failed to achieve any significant success. The Shu emperor [[Liu Shan]] also turned out to be an incompetent ruler who trusted corrupt officials. Shu gradually declined under Liu Shan's rule and was eventually [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|conquered by Wei forces]]. Jiang Wei attempted to restore Shu with the help of [[Zhong Hui]], a Wei general dissatisfied with Sima Zhao, but their plan failed and both of them were killed by Wei soldiers. Shortly after the fall of Shu, Sima Zhao died and his son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], forced the last Wei emperor, [[Cao Huan]], to abdicate the throne to him. Sima Yan then established the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] to replace the state of Cao Wei.\n\nIn Wu, there had been internal conflict among the nobles since Sun Quan's death. The regents [[Zhuge Ke]] and [[Sun Chen]] consecutively attempted to usurp the throne but were eventually ousted from power and eliminated in coups. Although stability was temporarily restored in Wu, the last Wu emperor, [[Sun Hao]], turned out to be a tyrant. Wu, the last of the Three Kingdoms, was eventually [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|conquered by the Jin dynasty]]. The fall of Wu marked the end of the near century-long era of civil strife historically known as the Three Kingdoms period.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}\n\nThe novel draws from historical sources, including [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

The antagonists, Cao Cao, Sun Quan and their followers, on the other hand, were often denigrated. This suited the political climate in the Ming dynasty, unlike in the Jin dynasty when Cao Wei was considered the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSome non-historical scenes in the novel have become well-known and subsequently became a part of traditional Chinese culture.\n\n==Literary analysis==\n[[File:Pang De Portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Pang De]] at the [[Battle of Fancheng]], from a [[Qing dynasty]] edition of the ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.]]\n\nIn the introduction to the 1959 reprint of the [[Charles Henry Brewitt-Taylor|Brewitt-Taylor]] translation, Roy Andrew Miller argues that the novel's chief theme is \"the nature of human ambition\".<ref name=\":1\" /> to which Moody adds the relationship between politics and morality, specifically the conflict between the idealism of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] political thought and the harsh realism of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as a related theme.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other dominant themes of the novel include: the rise and fall of the ideal liege (Liu Bei); finding the ideal minister (Zhuge Liang); the conflict between the ideal liege (Liu Bei) and the consummate villain (Cao Cao); and the cruelties and injustice of feudal or dynastic government.<ref name=\"roberts940\" />\n\nThe opening lines of the novel, \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.

One recent critic notes that the novel takes political and moral stands and lets the reader know which of the characters are heroes and which villains, yet the heroes are forced to make a tragic choice between equal values, not merely between good and evil. The heroes know that the end of the empire is ordained by this cosmic cycle of division and unity, yet their choices are moral, based on loyalty, not political.<ref name=Tung>Constantine Tung, \"Cosmic Foreordination and Human Commitment: The Tragic Volition in Three Kingdoms\", in Kimberly Ann Besio, Constantine Tung.

The character, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Joe Maneely]], is loosely based on the [[Morgan le Fay]] of [[Arthurian]] legend. In this version of the character, she is the half-faerie half-sister of the mythic [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]]. Her elven heritage granted her immortality, and she used this time to master the mystic arts. She occasionally tries to take over the world. She has been an opponent of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and in the 1970s, she appeared in the original ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' comic acting as a foe of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], and was opposed by a reincarnation of her \"ancient foe\" [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]]. She is a former lover of [[Doctor Doom]], and was a member of the [[Darkhold]]ers for a time.\n\nThe character was portrayed by [[Jessica Walter]] in the 1978 television film ''[[Dr. Strange (1978 film)|Dr. Strange]]''. [[Elizabeth Hurley]] portrayed the character in the third season of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nMorgan le Fay first appeared in [[Atlas Comics]] in ''Black Knight'' #1 (May 1955), written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Joe Maneely]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=248}}</ref> After the ''Black Knight'' series ended in 1956, she was eventually reintroduced into Marvel Comics in ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Medieval times===\nMorgan Le Fay was born in Tintagel Castle, in Cornwall, England, in the days of Camelot, in the Sixth Century A.D. She became a high priestess, and the leader of the Sixth Century cult of the [[Darkhold]], as well as Queen of Gorre (a section of Britain). She and the rest of the cult used the Darkhold to summon its author Chthon. When they found they could not control him, they sealed the dark god away in [[Wundagore]] Mountain.<ref>''Avengers'' #187. Marvel Comics.</ref> By this time - convinced that Morgan was thoroughly corrupted by evil - her apprentice and lover [[Magnus the Sorcerer]] stole the Darkhold from her.<ref>''Avengers'' #241. Marvel Comics.</ref> She, along with her lover, [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], was a nemesis for the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]].\n\nDuring this time, Morgan Le Fay was visited by a supervillain from the future named [[Doctor Doom]] to enlist her in helping wrest his mother [[Cynthia Von Doom]]'s soul from Hell. Le Fay agreed on the condition that Doom become the general of her army, undead warriors of those slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]]. [[Iron Man]] defeated Le Fay causing her to flee to another realm. Doom swore vengeance on Iron Man for this, vowing to see the hero dead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the modern era===\nMorgan Le Fay first projected her astral form from her physical body in the Sixth Century A.D. to the present day. She mentally dominated \"Slapper\" Struthers, transforming him into the superhuman Excaliber, and directed him to retrieve the Darkhold from Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When he failed, she sent her astral form to get the Darkhold from the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], and was defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Impressed by her mettle in battle, Morgan attempted to enlist Spider-Woman into her eternal servitude, but was denied.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Seeking revenge, she began tormenting Spider-Woman with hallucinations, but Magnus came to her aid, and Le Fay's physical body was destroyed in combat with Spider-Woman's astral form. However, she was able to lock out Spider-Woman's astral form from her physical body,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> and attempted to possess it for herself. She was thwarted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Magnus, [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] in a battle on the astral plane.<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMorgan then attempted to possess the body of Lisa Russell, but was repulsed by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #209</ref> Morgan then allied with [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]]. She dispatched [[Dreadknight]], Balor, and other Celtic netherworld monsters against the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Doctor Strange. She attempted to turn Earth into a dimension ruled by black magic.<ref>''Black Knight'' #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Avengers assemble again===\nUsing the monsters of [[Norse mythology]], she and Mordred lured the [[Scarlet Witch]] (and a team of Avengers) to [[Tintagel]] in Cornwall. There, she kidnapped the Scarlet Witch and used her reality-warping powers to 'bridge the gap' between her elven magic and an [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[doomsday device]] known as the Twilight Sword.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using the Sword, she remade reality: the world was now a [[Middle Ages]] equivalent of itself, except that she ruled the world, and had done so for some time.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Avengers stepped in and freed the Scarlet Witch, thus negating the original spell the others were based on, and restoring reality.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n[[Doctor Doom]] is revealed to be in a sexual/romantic relationship with Le Fay, traveling back to the past in order to carry on liaisons with her. Le Fay has told Doom to bring her back something \"of value\" as a gift the next time he comes to her time or not to come back at all. He later returns, asking for her help in creating an army of loyal inhuman warriors. She asks what she gets in return, to which Doom asks her what she wants, to which her response is currently unknown as Doom reappears in the present with his army of [[Mindless Ones]]. Later, Le Fay is seen sadly looking out her window for the return of Doom, who has been defeated and incarcerated by the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Dark Reign===\nDuring the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Morgan appears in the pages of ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' as the team's first nemesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11319 |title=Dark Avengers (2009) #3 &#124; Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref> She used a spell to peer into the future and witnessed the formation of the [[Dark Illuminati|Cabal]]. She traveled into the future with an army of demons.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> At first, she attempted to kill Doom when he was a child, but then decided to go ahead several decades, so that Doom could fully know why she was going to kill him, choosing after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] and engaged Doom in magical combat. As Doom begins to lose, a HAMMER soldier calls Osborn, and the Dark Avengers arrive to rescue Doom. The [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] tears off her head, but she subsequently violently reappeared in his place, and took control over the new [[Mac Gargan|Spider-Man]], who attacked [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is killed again by the new [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]], but she reappears again. She and her demons are seen fighting the Dark Avengers, while Doom and [[Green Goblin|Iron Patriot]] travel back in time to kill her in her own time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when they arrive, after an unsuccessful magical assault on the two men (due to the considerable amount of iron in their armor suits, the one substance her faerie enchantments cannot affect), she reveals to Osborn her knowledge that Doom plans to betray her and that if they kill her, it will affect Doom's own lifeline, claiming Doom will fall to his nature and betray Osborn; Doom responds by chanting a spell of a language that even she possesses no knowledge to forcibly send the sorceress into her own enchanted cauldron, despite her screams and pleas. Though Morgan lives, she is sent to 1,000,000 BC where she runs from a tribe of [[Caveman|cavemen]] fighting a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Doctor Doom magically restores Latveria and the revived Dark Avengers head back to America.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Avengers World===\nAfter having been freed by her daughter Caroline le Fay from her own magic cauldron that Doom trapped her in, Morgan le Fay took over a City of the Dead underneath Velletri, Italy, a mystical necropolis of which there are many below European cities.<ref>''Avengers World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> From here she launched a massive attack with armies of the dead all over Europe.<ref>''Avengers World'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Avengers and the Euroforce joined forces to take her down, but they were easily overpowered by the hordes of the dead.<ref>''Avengers World'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sebastian Druid tried to aid the heroes, but he was killed by le Fay shortly after arriving at the city.<ref>''Avengers World'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, killing Druid worked out against Morgan's plans. He became a ghost of the city which, being one of them, allowed his magic to work, pulling back the armies back to their respective necropolises, severely weakening le Fay. The Avengers and the Euroforce proceeded to beat her up, forcing her to retreat.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Queen of Otherworld===\nMorgan le Fay later resurfaced and planned to conquer Camelot on Otherworld but when the flowers of Krakoa reach Otherworld to form a Gateway to Krakoa, it infected Camelot, causing le Fay to find a way to destroy it. In order to achieve this, she needed to terminate the \"Witchbreed\", who were responsible for this. After [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]] and his twin sister, [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]] came to fix the Gateway, le Fay apprehended them and took control of Brian, making him to turn on his sister. However, he managed to give to Betsy his amulet, which allowed her to escape. <ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan then allied with the Coven Akkaba in order to deal with the Witchbreeds.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMorgan le Fay possesses a natural affinity for magical forces which is a result of her half-faerie genetic structure. She possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] with centuries of study, she is considered one of the greatest sorceresses in Earth's history. Her magical powers are derived from three major sources. Due to her faerie heritage she possesses innate personal powers such as the ability to control minds. She also has the faerie ability to manipulate mystical energy, often through spells and enchantments of ancient Celtic origin, an ability she has honed through practice. She also possesses abilities all humans potentially have, such as the ability to engage in astral projection. Finally, she has abilities as a high priestess of the Earth goddess ([[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]) by invoking her Celtic name, Danu.\n\nMorgan can mystically manipulate both the natural environment of Earth and the environment of the astral plane in which she once existed. She can cast illusions, project mystical bolts (which can affect physical beings and objects even when she is in astral form), create mystical force shields and remove spirits from their bodies and place those spirits under her control. When in physical form, she can fly and change her shape into other people or animals (both real and mythical). She also has healing powers which she might have used on her former foe King Arthur on transporting him to Otherworld.\n\nMorgan can also tap into and manipulate powerful magical energies for powerful feats of magic without having to tax upon her normal magical abilities, such as when she used the power of the [[Norn Stones]] and the Twilight Sword to restructure reality (although she needed the Scarlet Witch to bridge her Faerie heritage to the Asgardian magic).<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-3 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan has utilized the ''Crimson Bands of Cyttorak'' to bind Doctor Strange and Balor.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} She is also able to time travel.\n\nMorgan is virtually immortal. Her spirit has restored her physical body at the various times it has been destroyed.\n\nDue to her hybrid nature (half-human and half-faerie), Morgan le Fay has the faerie's vulnerability to \"cold iron\" or steel. These materials can cause her harm both in her physical and astral form.\n\nIn ''New Avengers'' #53, the Eye of Agamotto appeared to Morgan, as it considered her a possible replacement for Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Ultron===\nDuring the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Wolverine and Invisible Woman's plans to kill [[Hank Pym]] to prevent the creation of [[Ultron]] caused an alternate reality in which Morgan le Fay had conquered half the world following a war between Asgard and Latveria and magic has overcome technology. Morgan le Fay later attacks with a swarm of magically-powered [[Doombot]]s. The Defenders fight them with Iron Man controlling hundreds of drones and accusing Morgan le Fay of having sent the time travelers back in time. She claims innocence and then points out to Iron Man how a pair of Helicarriers are crashing into the heart of New York City.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8</ref>\n\n===Weirdworld version===\nDuring the \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline, a variation of Morgan le Fay from Earth-15238 was salvaged by God Emperor Doom and made the baroness of the [[Battleworld]] domain of [[Weirdworld]] under the alias of Witch Queen le Fay. She is served by the Magma Men from [[The Saga of Crystar|Crystallium]].<ref>''Weirdworld'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan le Fay and her forces gained an enemy in [[Arkon]] who had stolen from her many times.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #2</ref> She later hired [[Skull the Slayer]] to dispose of Arkon.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight between Morgan le Fay's forces and the forces of the Swamp Queen, a variation of [[Jennifer Kale]] that ruled Weirdworld's [[Man-Thing]]s, Battleworld fell apart and neither side was victorious. Weirdworld somehow ended up on Earth-616 in the Bermuda Triangle.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing the restoration of the Multiverse, the Weirdworld domain which was ruled by the Witch Queen le Fay, an alternate Morgan le Fay, was materialized in the new universe as an anomalous continent in the Bermuda Triangle. When a Boeing 747 crash-landed there, Morgan le Fay was informed by her minion Warg that a girl named Rebecca Rodriguez got a hold of the Wuxian Seed and that Goleta the Wizardslayer slew Ogeode.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Magma Man Moltar later told Morgan le Fay that their forces are ready to strike against the Swamp Queen's Army at the Fang Mountains. While still wanting to get her hands on the Wuxian Seed, Morgan le Fay told Moltar to divert the forces to pursue Rebecca Rodriguez and Goleta the Wizardslayer instead.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan le Fay later unleashed a Magma Man called the Mammoth Inferno to attack the Forge of the Grand Mechanic.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her backstory was revealed that she was sold into slavery upon being brought to Weirdworld. She overcame the slavery with the help of Elizabeth and Nakia the Grand Mechanic. This led to Morgan le Fay creating the Kingdom of the Torch.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the time when they were hiding from [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Patient Zero]]'s creation Itsy Bitsy, Spider-Man and Deadpool helped the Bogswaggers of Bathsalthia escape from Morgan le Fay's forces.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] opened a portal to Weirdworld, they worked on a project that involved harvesting magic while contending with the invasive Skrullduggers. When he, Angel, and Blake made their way inside the Roxxon outpost where three engineers and six soldiers are taking refuge, [[Weapon H]] discovers that the magic that they are harvesting is coming from Morgan le Fay.<ref>''Weapon H'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> After telling Weapon H not to listen to Angel's lies, Morgan le Fay revealed part of her backstory to Weapon H and how she found a way to tame the Skrullduggers until Roxxon invaded, took her captive, destroyed her palace, and caused the Skrullduggers to run wild. As Angel tries to prevent Weapon H and Blake from falling into Morgan le Fay's control, Morgan mesmerizes them where she claims that she can cure Blake and reveals Weapon H's full identity of Clayton Cortez. Dr. Espinoza then has Granville open the door enabling the Skrullduggers to get in. After Weapon H blocked the Skrullduggers from getting in, Morgan le Fay exposes the fact that Angel is actually Black Widow's clone using an Image Inducer claiming that Captain America sent her to spy on Weapon H. Still under Morgan's control, Weapon H who regains control of the Skrullduggers. After destroying the facility, Morgan le Fay leads a mind-controlled Weapon H and the Skrullduggers into taking over the world.<ref>''Weapon H'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan le Fay arrives at the Inaku village with a mind-controlled Weapon H and the Skrullduggers where she reveals to Korg and Titania that she has Weapon H under her control as well as being the queen to the Inaku.

As the gun wielded by Dr. Espinoza is going to explode, Morgan states to Black Widow that she does not know any tricks to undo it.<ref>''Weapon H'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> After [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] disarms the gun, Morgan le Fay does a magic attack on him. She is surprised when he transforms into Minotaur.

The character, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Joe Maneely]], is loosely based on the [[Morgan le Fay]] of [[Arthurian]] legend. In this version of the character, she is the half-faerie half-sister of the mythic [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]]. Her elven heritage granted her immortality, and she used this time to master the mystic arts. She occasionally tries to take over the world. She has been an opponent of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and in the 1970s, she appeared in the original ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' comic acting as a foe of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], and was opposed by a reincarnation of her \"ancient foe\" [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]]. She is a former lover of [[Doctor Doom]], and was a member of the [[Darkhold]]ers for a time.\n\nThe character was portrayed by [[Jessica Walter]] in the 1978 television film ''[[Dr. Strange (1978 film)|Dr. Strange]]''. [[Elizabeth Hurley]] portrayed the character in the third season of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nMorgan le Fay first appeared in [[Atlas Comics]] in ''Black Knight'' #1 (May 1955), written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Joe Maneely]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=248}}</ref> After the ''Black Knight'' series ended in 1956, she was eventually reintroduced into Marvel Comics in ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Medieval times===\nMorgan Le Fay was born in Tintagel Castle, in Cornwall, England, in the days of Camelot, in the Sixth Century A.D. She became a high priestess, and the leader of the Sixth Century cult of the [[Darkhold]], as well as Queen of Gorre (a section of Britain). She and the rest of the cult used the Darkhold to summon its author Chthon. When they found they could not control him, they sealed the dark god away in [[Wundagore]] Mountain.<ref>''Avengers'' #187. Marvel Comics.</ref> By this time - convinced that Morgan was thoroughly corrupted by evil - her apprentice and lover [[Magnus the Sorcerer]] stole the Darkhold from her.<ref>''Avengers'' #241. Marvel Comics.</ref> She, along with her lover, [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], was a nemesis for the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]].\n\nDuring this time, Morgan Le Fay was visited by a supervillain from the future named [[Doctor Doom]] to enlist her in helping wrest his mother [[Cynthia Von Doom]]'s soul from Hell. Le Fay agreed on the condition that Doom become the general of her army, undead warriors of those slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]]. [[Iron Man]] defeated Le Fay causing her to flee to another realm. Doom swore vengeance on Iron Man for this, vowing to see the hero dead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Conflict with the modern era===\nMorgan Le Fay first projected her astral form from her physical body in the Sixth Century A.D. to the present day. She mentally dominated \"Slapper\" Struthers, transforming him into the superhuman Excaliber, and directed him to retrieve the Darkhold from Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When he failed, she sent her astral form to get the Darkhold from the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], and was defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Impressed by her mettle in battle, Morgan attempted to enlist Spider-Woman into her eternal servitude, but was denied.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Seeking revenge, she began tormenting Spider-Woman with hallucinations, but Magnus came to her aid, and Le Fay's physical body was destroyed in combat with Spider-Woman's astral form. However, she was able to lock out Spider-Woman's astral form from her physical body,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> and attempted to possess it for herself. She was thwarted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Magnus, [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] in a battle on the astral plane.<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMorgan then attempted to possess the body of Lisa Russell, but was repulsed by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #209</ref> Morgan then allied with [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]]. She dispatched [[Dreadknight]], Balor, and other Celtic netherworld monsters against the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Doctor Strange. She attempted to turn Earth into a dimension ruled by black magic.<ref>''Black Knight'' #2-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Avengers assemble again===\nUsing the monsters of [[Norse mythology]], she and Mordred lured the [[Scarlet Witch]] (and a team of Avengers) to [[Tintagel]] in Cornwall. There, she kidnapped the Scarlet Witch and used her reality-warping powers to 'bridge the gap' between her elven magic and an [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[doomsday device]] known as the Twilight Sword.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using the Sword, she remade reality: the world was now a [[Middle Ages]] equivalent of itself, except that she ruled the world, and had done so for some time.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Avengers stepped in and freed the Scarlet Witch, thus negating the original spell the others were based on, and restoring reality.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n[[Doctor Doom]] is revealed to be in a sexual/romantic relationship with Le Fay, traveling back to the past in order to carry on liaisons with her. Le Fay has told Doom to bring her back something \"of value\" as a gift the next time he comes to her time or not to come back at all. He later returns, asking for her help in creating an army of loyal inhuman warriors. She asks what she gets in return, to which Doom asks her what she wants, to which her response is currently unknown as Doom reappears in the present with his army of [[Mindless Ones]]. Later, Le Fay is seen sadly looking out her window for the return of Doom, who has been defeated and incarcerated by the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Dark Reign===\nDuring the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Morgan appears in the pages of ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' as the team's first nemesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11319 |title=Dark Avengers (2009) #3 &#124; Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref> She used a spell to peer into the future and witnessed the formation of the [[Dark Illuminati|Cabal]]. She traveled into the future with an army of demons.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> At first, she attempted to kill Doom when he was a child, but then decided to go ahead several decades, so that Doom could fully know why she was going to kill him, choosing after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] and engaged Doom in magical combat. As Doom begins to lose, a HAMMER soldier calls Osborn, and the Dark Avengers arrive to rescue Doom. The [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] tears off her head, but she subsequently violently reappeared in his place, and took control over the new [[Mac Gargan|Spider-Man]], who attacked [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> She is killed again by the new [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]], but she reappears again. She and her demons are seen fighting the Dark Avengers, while Doom and [[Green Goblin|Iron Patriot]] travel back in time to kill her in her own time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, when they arrive, after an unsuccessful magical assault on the two men (due to the considerable amount of iron in their armor suits, the one substance her faerie enchantments cannot affect), she reveals to Osborn her knowledge that Doom plans to betray her and that if they kill her, it will affect Doom's own lifeline, claiming Doom will fall to his nature and betray Osborn; Doom responds by chanting a spell of a language that even she possesses no knowledge to forcibly send the sorceress into her own enchanted cauldron, despite her screams and pleas. Though Morgan lives, she is sent to 1,000,000 BC where she runs from a tribe of [[Caveman|cavemen]] fighting a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Doctor Doom magically restores Latveria and the revived Dark Avengers head back to America.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Avengers World===\nAfter having been freed by her daughter Caroline le Fay from her own magic cauldron that Doom trapped her in, Morgan le Fay took over a City of the Dead underneath Velletri, Italy, a mystical necropolis of which there are many below European cities.<ref>''Avengers World'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> From here she launched a massive attack with armies of the dead all over Europe.<ref>''Avengers World'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Avengers and the Euroforce joined forces to take her down, but they were easily overpowered by the hordes of the dead.<ref>''Avengers World'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sebastian Druid tried to aid the heroes, but he was killed by le Fay shortly after arriving at the city.<ref>''Avengers World'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, killing Druid worked out against Morgan's plans. He became a ghost of the city which, being one of them, allowed his magic to work, pulling back the armies back to their respective necropolises, severely weakening le Fay. The Avengers and the Euroforce proceeded to beat her up, forcing her to retreat.<ref>''Avengers World'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Queen of Otherworld===\nMorgan le Fay later resurfaced and planned to conquer Camelot on Otherworld but when the flowers of Krakoa reach Otherworld to form a Gateway to Krakoa, it infected Camelot, causing le Fay to find a way to destroy it. In order to achieve this, she needed to terminate the \"Witchbreed\", who were responsible for this. After Brian Braddock and his twin sister, Betsy Braddock came to fix the Gateway, le Fay apprehended them and took control of Brian, making him to turn on his sister. However, he managed to give to Betsy his amulet, which allowed her to escape. <ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan then allied with the Coven Akkaba in order to deal with the Witchbreeds.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMorgan le Fay possesses a natural affinity for magical forces which is a result of her half-faerie genetic structure. She possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] with centuries of study, she is considered one of the greatest sorceresses in Earth's history. Her magical powers are derived from three major sources. Due to her faerie heritage she possesses innate personal powers such as the ability to control minds. She also has the faerie ability to manipulate mystical energy, often through spells and enchantments of ancient Celtic origin, an ability she has honed through practice. She also possesses abilities all humans potentially have, such as the ability to engage in astral projection. Finally, she has abilities as a high priestess of the Earth goddess ([[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]) by invoking her Celtic name, Danu.\n\nMorgan can mystically manipulate both the natural environment of Earth and the environment of the astral plane in which she once existed. She can cast illusions, project mystical bolts (which can affect physical beings and objects even when she is in astral form), create mystical force shields and remove spirits from their bodies and place those spirits under her control. When in physical form, she can fly and change her shape into other people or animals (both real and mythical). She also has healing powers which she might have used on her former foe King Arthur on transporting him to Otherworld.\n\nMorgan can also tap into and manipulate powerful magical energies for powerful feats of magic without having to tax upon her normal magical abilities, such as when she used the power of the [[Norn Stones]] and the Twilight Sword to restructure reality (although she needed the Scarlet Witch to bridge her Faerie heritage to the Asgardian magic).<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #1-3 (1997). Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan has utilized the ''Crimson Bands of Cyttorak'' to bind Doctor Strange and Balor.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} She is also able to time travel.\n\nMorgan is virtually immortal. Her spirit has restored her physical body at the various times it has been destroyed.\n\nDue to her hybrid nature (half-human and half-faerie), Morgan le Fay has the faerie's vulnerability to \"cold iron\" or steel. These materials can cause her harm both in her physical and astral form.\n\nIn ''New Avengers'' #53, the Eye of Agamotto appeared to Morgan, as it considered her a possible replacement for Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Ultron===\nDuring the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Wolverine and Invisible Woman's plans to kill [[Hank Pym]] to prevent the creation of [[Ultron]] caused an alternate reality in which Morgan le Fay had conquered half the world following a war between Asgard and Latveria and magic has overcome technology. Morgan le Fay later attacks with a swarm of magically-powered [[Doombot]]s. The Defenders fight them with Iron Man controlling hundreds of drones and accusing Morgan le Fay of having sent the time travelers back in time. She claims innocence and then points out to Iron Man how a pair of Helicarriers are crashing into the heart of New York City.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8</ref>\n\n===Weirdworld version===\nDuring the \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline, a variation of Morgan le Fay from Earth-15238 was salvaged by God Emperor Doom and made the baroness of the [[Battleworld]] domain of [[Weirdworld]] under the alias of Witch Queen le Fay. She is served by the Magma Men from [[The Saga of Crystar|Crystallium]].<ref>''Weirdworld'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan le Fay and her forces gained an enemy in [[Arkon]] who had stolen from her many times.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #2</ref> She later hired [[Skull the Slayer]] to dispose of Arkon.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight between Morgan le Fay's forces and the forces of the Swamp Queen, a variation of [[Jennifer Kale]] that ruled Weirdworld's [[Man-Thing]]s, Battleworld fell apart and neither side was victorious. Weirdworld somehow ended up on Earth-616 in the Bermuda Triangle.<ref>''Weirdworld'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing the restoration of the Multiverse, the Weirdworld domain which was ruled by the Witch Queen le Fay, an alternate Morgan le Fay, was materialized in the new universe as an anomalous continent in the Bermuda Triangle. When a Boeing 747 crash-landed there, Morgan le Fay was informed by her minion Warg that a girl named Rebecca Rodriguez got a hold of the Wuxian Seed and that Goleta the Wizardslayer slew Ogeode.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Magma Man Moltar later told Morgan le Fay that their forces are ready to strike against the Swamp Queen's Army at the Fang Mountains. While still wanting to get her hands on the Wuxian Seed, Morgan le Fay told Moltar to divert the forces to pursue Rebecca Rodriguez and Goleta the Wizardslayer instead.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan le Fay later unleashed a Magma Man called the Mammoth Inferno to attack the Forge of the Grand Mechanic.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Her backstory was revealed that she was sold into slavery upon being brought to Weirdworld. She overcame the slavery with the help of Elizabeth and Nakia the Grand Mechanic. This led to Morgan le Fay creating the Kingdom of the Torch.<ref>''Weirdworld'' Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the time when they were hiding from [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Patient Zero]]'s creation Itsy Bitsy, Spider-Man and Deadpool helped the Bogswaggers of Bathsalthia escape from Morgan le Fay's forces.<ref>''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] opened a portal to Weirdworld, they worked on a project that involved harvesting magic while contending with the invasive Skrullduggers. When he, Angel, and Blake made their way inside the Roxxon outpost where three engineers and six soldiers are taking refuge, [[Weapon H]] discovers that the magic that they are harvesting is coming from Morgan le Fay.<ref>''Weapon H'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> After telling Weapon H not to listen to Angel's lies, Morgan le Fay revealed part of her backstory to Weapon H and how she found a way to tame the Skrullduggers until Roxxon invaded, took her captive, destroyed her palace, and caused the Skrullduggers to run wild. As Angel tries to prevent Weapon H and Blake from falling into Morgan le Fay's control, Morgan mesmerizes them where she claims that she can cure Blake and reveals Weapon H's full identity of Clayton Cortez. Dr. Espinoza then has Granville open the door enabling the Skrullduggers to get in. After Weapon H blocked the Skrullduggers from getting in, Morgan le Fay exposes the fact that Angel is actually Black Widow's clone using an Image Inducer claiming that Captain America sent her to spy on Weapon H. Still under Morgan's control, Weapon H who regains control of the Skrullduggers. After destroying the facility, Morgan le Fay leads a mind-controlled Weapon H and the Skrullduggers into taking over the world.<ref>''Weapon H'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Morgan le Fay arrives at the Inaku village with a mind-controlled Weapon H and the Skrullduggers where she reveals to Korg and Titania that she has Weapon H under her control as well as being the queen to the Inaku. Morgan le Fay instructs Protector Hara to assist Weapon H and the Skrullduggers in attacking those who were sent by Roxxon. As the gun wielded by Dr. Espinoza is going to explode, Morgan states to Black Widow that she does not know any tricks to undo it.<ref>''Weapon H'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> After [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] disarms the gun, Morgan le Fay does a magic attack on him. She is surprised when he transforms into Minotaur. After a brief fight between Weapon H and Minotaur, both of them escape much to the dismay of Morgan le Fay. The Inaku then praise Morgan le Fay as the Queen of Weirdworld.<ref>''Weapon H'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* An elderly version of Morgan le Fay appeared in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode \"Mother of Doom!\".

The Tamil blogosphere has a considerable number of contributors from [[Sri Lanka]] and Singapore, and is one of the largest blogospheres resident in India.\n\n==Tamil language typing tools==\nEarly adopters used different software to type in Tamil.

Later on, a standardized encoding was agreed upon and newer iterations of Tamil software (such as Azhagi, NHM writer, The tamilsg editor, & [[Google transliteration]]) use Unicode.<ref>http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0B80.pdf</ref>\n\n==Distribution and usage==\nEarlier on, the majority of Tamil bloggers were from outside India and Sri Lanka.
