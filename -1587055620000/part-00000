It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\n\n*At the beginning of the film, the Seventh Doctor uses a brand new version of the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] to seal the Master's remains in a casket. The device was previously destroyed in [[The Visitation (Doctor Who)| \"The Visitation\"]]. The jelly babies, which the [[Fourth Doctor]] had a fondness for, also reappear during the opening scene and then later during the story.\n\n*The [[Seventh Doctor]] wears his trademark panama hat which he wore throughout his tenure in the Classic Series, which was actually owned by [[Sylvester McCoy]] himself.\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] mentions that he once met [[Leonardo Di Vinci]] when the artist had a cold and had met [[Puccini]] during the last years of the composer's life.\n\n*The [[Eye of Harmony]] in the [[TARDIS|TARDIS' Cloister Room]] was previously located on the Doctor's home planet [[Gallifrey]].\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] shows Grace and Chang Lee where [[Gallifrey]] is, remarking that the planet \"a good ten minutes in this old thing.\"\n\n*The Doctor's romantic nature in this story would later be shown with the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors when the series returned in 2005.\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Yee Jee Tso would later return in 2002 to play Major Jal Brant in the [[Seventh Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Excelis Decays]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/3-Doctor-Who-Excelis-Decays|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Excelis Decays|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> and Doctor Reece Goddard in the [[Sixth Doctor]] webcast ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/Doctor-Who-Real-Time|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Real Time|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n*Daphne Ashbrook would later return in 2004 alongside [[Paul McGann]]'s [[Eighth Doctor]] as Perfection in the audio drama ''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/64-Doctor-Who-The-Next-Life|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Next Life|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n* Tso and Ashbrook returned to Big Finish together playing Captain Ruth Matheson and Warrant Officer Charlie Sato of UNIT in the audio dramas ''Tales From The Vault''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/releases/v/tales-from-the-vault-501 |title=6.01.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the character who appeared in two theatrical ''Dr. Who'' films|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| number             = 156\n| serial_name        = Doctor Who: The Television Movie\n| show               = DW\n| type               = television film\n| image              = [[File:Doctor Who 1996 poster.jpg|230px]]\n| caption            = 1996 promotional poster\n| doctors            =\n* [[Paul McGann]] ([[Eighth Doctor]])\n*[[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n| companion          = [[Daphne Ashbrook]] ([[Grace Holloway]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Yee Jee Tso]] \u2013 Chang Lee\n*[[Eric Roberts]] \u2013 [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]\n*[[John Novak]] \u2013 Salinger\n*Michael David Simms \u2013 Dr. Swift\n*Eliza Roberts \u2013 Miranda\n*Dave Hurtubise \u2013 Professor Wagg\n*Dolores Drake \u2013 Curtis\n*Catherine Lough \u2013 Wheeler\n*[[Will Sasso|William Sasso]] \u2013 Pete\n*Joel Wirkkunen \u2013 Ted\n*Jeremy Radick \u2013 Gareth\n*Bill Croft \u2013 Motorcyclist Policeman\n*[[Mi-Jung Lee]] \u2013 News Anchor\n*Joanna Piros \u2013 News Anchor\n*Dee Jay Jackson \u2013 Security Man\n*Gordon Tipple \u2013 The Master on Trial\n| director           = [[Geoffrey Sax]]\n| writer             = [[Matthew Jacobs]]\n| script_editor      = None\n| producer           = Peter V.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\n\n*At the beginning of the film, the Seventh Doctor uses a brand new version of the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] to seal the Master's remains in a casket. The device was previously destroyed in [[The Visitation (Doctor Who)| \"The Visitation\"]].

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContinuity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(film)"}

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], it had a population of 14,665.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/17/17193.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Carmi, Illinois|Carmi]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known locally as \"[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]\".\n\n==History==\nWhite County was organized from [[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin County]] in 1815, and was named after Captain Leonard White (some accounts say Captain Isaac White), a Gallatin County legislator who is credited with the idea of extending the Illinois-Wisconsin border a few miles north of the southern tip of Lake Michigan and was also in charge of the salt works at [[Equality, Illinois|Equality]]. He was killed in 1811 at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. The county seat, [[Carmi, Illinois|Carmi]], was founded in 1814, and incorporated in 1816. The first courthouse was in the log cabin of John Craw.\n\nThe first white settlers came to White County between 1807 and 1809. The first settlements were near the [[Little Wabash River]] and Big Prairie, one of the numerous prairies in the county. These families\u2014Hanna, Land, Hay, Williams, Calvert, Ratcliff, Holderby, Robinson, Stewart, among others\u2014typically had spent time in the Carolinas, [[Kentucky]] or [[Tennessee]] before moving into Illinois, and most were of Scots-Irish descent. Many came through the land office at [[Shawneetown, Illinois|Shawneetown]], [[Illinois]], which was a port for flatboats which traveled the [[Ohio River]].\n\nOther early settlements were [[Grayville, Illinois|Grayville]], located at the mouth of [[Bonpas Creek]] and the [[Wabash River]], settled by the Gray family around 1810; [[Phillipstown, Illinois|Phillipstown]], on the bluffs above the Wabash and Fox River floodplain; and [[New Haven, Illinois|New Haven]] (mostly in Gallatin County), which was home to a brother of [[Daniel Boone]] around 1818. Old Sharon Church (Presbyterian), located near the later village of Sacramento, was organized around 1816, and the village of [[Seven Mile Prairie]] was established a few miles north of the church in the 1830s. The parents of longtime [[Abraham Lincoln]] girlfriend [[Ann Rutledge]] were part of this group, along with families named McArthy, Miller, McClellan, Pollard, Storey, Fields, and Johnson.\n\nAbout 1839, a group of Irish immigrants began moving into the extreme western part of [[Enfield Township]], led by Patrick Dolan, as well as members of the Mitchell and Dunn clans. Dolan was auctioneer in 1853 when the village of Enfield was platted, as Seven Mile moved west in anticipation of a railroad line, which was not built until 1872. German families moved into the middle portion of the county in the 1840s and onward, especially from the Baden region, and included the family names of Rebstock, Dartt, Brown, Sailer, Stanley, and Drone.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century saw the establishment of the towns of [[Norris City, Illinois|Norris City]], [[Springerton, Illinois|Springerton]], [[Mill Shoals, Illinois|Mill Shoals]] (once the home of a thriving barrel-making industry which depleted the nearby virgin forests), [[Epworth, Illinois|Epworth]], [[Herald, Illinois|Herald]], [[Burnt Prairie, Illinois|Burnt Prairie]] (previously known as \"Liberty\"), [[Crossville, Illinois|Crossville]], [[Phillipstown, Illinois|Phillipstown]], [[Concord, Illinois|Concord]] (also known as Emma), [[Maunie, Illinois|Maunie]] and [[Rising Sun, White County, Illinois|Rising Sun]] (commonly called Dogtown)--the latter two villages are located on the Wabash and attracted several African-American families. A number of villages which no longer exist were also formed: Trumbull, Roland, Middle Point, Stokes Station, Gossett, Bungay, Calvin, Iron, and Dolan Settlement.\n\nIn 1925, White County was the last of five Illinois counties effected by the infamous [[Tri State Tornado]]. Although the storm spared the towns of Carmi, Enfield and Crossville, significant damage was done to the surrounding rural areas, where 28 people were killed, dozens were injured and scores of homes and farms were destroyed.\n\nAgriculture was the primary industry of White County until the summer of 1939, when oil was discovered in the Storms and Stinson fields in the Wabash River Bottoms. The population of Carmi doubled within two years, from 2,700 to 5,400, with corresponding increases at Crossville and Grayville\u2014in 1940 it was said one could walk between these two towns by simply walking from rig to rig. Many of these workers migrated from previous oil booms in [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. As of 2013, [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] is underway near Carmi.<ref name=Fracking>{{cite web|last=Webber|first=Tammy|title=Illinois high-volume 'fracking' underway|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-29/illinois-high-volume-fracking-underway.html|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe current population of White County is a little over 17,000, with 6,500 in the county seat of Carmi. There is a high number of retired people, and many citizens work in the factories of [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] or [[Mount Vernon, Indiana|Mount Vernon]], [[Indiana]], located 45 and 25 miles to the east, respectively. Besides oil and agriculture, industries include auto parts manufacturing, plastics, a convenience store distribution center and underground coal mining.\n\nWhite County, Illinois was also the site of the ill-fated [[Erie Canal Soda Pop Festival]] also known as the Bull Island Fest in 1972. Three county sheriffs were the only police force present at the festival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:White County Illinois 1815.png|White County between its 1815 creation and 1818\nFile:White County Illinois 1818.png|White County between 1818 and 1819\nFile:White County Illinois 1819.png|White County between 1819 and 1821\nFile:White County Illinois 1821.png|White County in 1821, reduced to its current borders by the creation of Hamilton County\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|502|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|495|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.1|sqmi}} (1.4%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Carmi, Illinois]]\n|22|40|3.08\n|26|46|3.01\n|35|57|4.41\n|44|68|4.18\n|53|77|5.00\n|63|86|4.56\n|67|89|4.59\n|64|88|3.57\n|57|81|3.14\n|44|70|2.61\n|36|56|4.23\n|26|44|4.00\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0190\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Carmi, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Carmi have ranged from a low of {{convert|22|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|89|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-20|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1994 and a record high of {{convert|103|\u00b0F}} was recorded in August 2007.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], it had a population of 14,665.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/17/17193.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Carmi, Illinois|Carmi]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> It is located in the southern portion of Illinois known locally as \"[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]\".\n\n==History==\nWhite County was organized from [[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin County]] in 1815, and was named after Captain Leonard White (some accounts say Captain Isaac White), a Gallatin County legislator who is credited with the idea of extending the Illinois-Wisconsin border a few miles north of the southern tip of Lake Michigan and was also in charge of the salt works at [[Equality, Illinois|Equality]]. He was killed in 1811 at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. The county seat, [[Carmi, Illinois|Carmi]], was founded in 1814, and incorporated in 1816. The first courthouse was in the log cabin of John Craw.\n\nThe first white settlers came to White County between 1807 and 1809. The first settlements were near the [[Little Wabash River]] and Big Prairie, one of the numerous prairies in the county. These families\u2014Hanna, Land, Hay, Williams, Calvert, Ratcliff, Holderby, Robinson, Stewart, among others\u2014typically had spent time in the Carolinas, [[Kentucky]] or [[Tennessee]] before moving into Illinois, and most were of Scots-Irish descent. Many came through the land office at [[Shawneetown, Illinois|Shawneetown]], [[Illinois]], which was a port for flatboats which traveled the [[Ohio River]].\n\nOther early settlements were [[Grayville, Illinois|Grayville]], located at the mouth of [[Bonpas Creek]] and the [[Wabash River]], settled by the Gray family around 1810; [[Phillipstown, Illinois|Phillipstown]], on the bluffs above the Wabash and Fox River floodplain; and [[New Haven, Illinois|New Haven]] (mostly in Gallatin County), which was home to a brother of [[Daniel Boone]] around 1818. Old Sharon Church (Presbyterian), located near the later village of Sacramento, was organized around 1816, and the village of [[Seven Mile Prairie]] was established a few miles north of the church in the 1830s. The parents of longtime [[Abraham Lincoln]] girlfriend [[Ann Rutledge]] were part of this group, along with families named McArthy, Miller, McClellan, Pollard, Storey, Fields, and Johnson.\n\nAbout 1839, a group of Irish immigrants began moving into the extreme western part of [[Enfield Township]], led by Patrick Dolan, as well as members of the Mitchell and Dunn clans. Dolan was auctioneer in 1853 when the village of Enfield was platted, as Seven Mile moved west in anticipation of a railroad line, which was not built until 1872. German families moved into the middle portion of the county in the 1840s and onward, especially from the Baden region, and included the family names of Rebstock, Dartt, Brown, Sailer, Stanley, and Drone.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century saw the establishment of the towns of [[Norris City, Illinois|Norris City]], [[Springerton, Illinois|Springerton]], [[Mill Shoals, Illinois|Mill Shoals]] (once the home of a thriving barrel-making industry which depleted the nearby virgin forests), [[Epworth, Illinois|Epworth]], [[Herald, Illinois|Herald]], [[Burnt Prairie, Illinois|Burnt Prairie]] (previously known as \"Liberty\"), [[Crossville, Illinois|Crossville]], [[Phillipstown, Illinois|Phillipstown]], [[Concord, Illinois|Concord]] (also known as Emma), [[Maunie, Illinois|Maunie]] and [[Rising Sun, White County, Illinois|Rising Sun]] (commonly called Dogtown)--the latter two villages are located on the Wabash and attracted several African-American families. A number of villages which no longer exist were also formed: Trumbull, Roland, Middle Point, Stokes Station, Gossett, Bungay, Calvin, Iron, and Dolan Settlement.\n\nIn 1925, White County was the last of five Illinois counties effected by the infamous [[Tri State Tornado]]. Although the storm spared the towns of Carmi, Enfield and Crossville, significant damage was done to the surrounding rural areas, where 28 people were killed, dozens were injured and scores of homes and farms were destroyed. \n\nAgriculture was the primary industry of White County until the summer of 1939, when oil was discovered in the Storms and Stinson fields in the Wabash River Bottoms. The population of Carmi doubled within two years, from 2,700 to 5,400, with corresponding increases at Crossville and Grayville\u2014in 1940 it was said one could walk between these two towns by simply walking from rig to rig. Many of these workers migrated from previous oil booms in [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. As of 2013, [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] is underway near Carmi.<ref name=Fracking>{{cite web|last=Webber|first=Tammy|title=Illinois high-volume 'fracking' underway|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2013-05-29/illinois-high-volume-fracking-underway.html|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe current population of White County is a little over 17,000, with 6,500 in the county seat of Carmi. There is a high number of retired people, and many citizens work in the factories of [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] or [[Mount Vernon, Indiana|Mount Vernon]], [[Indiana]], located 45 and 25 miles to the east, respectively. Besides oil and agriculture, industries include auto parts manufacturing, plastics, a convenience store distribution center and underground coal mining.\n\nWhite County, Illinois was also the site of the ill-fated [[Erie Canal Soda Pop Festival]] also known as the Bull Island Fest in 1972. Three county sheriffs were the only police force present at the festival.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:White County Illinois 1815.png|White County between its 1815 creation and 1818\nFile:White County Illinois 1818.png|White County between 1818 and 1819\nFile:White County Illinois 1819.png|White County between 1819 and 1821\nFile:White County Illinois 1821.png|White County in 1821, reduced to its current borders by the creation of Hamilton County\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|502|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|495|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.1|sqmi}} (1.4%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Carmi, Illinois]]\n|22|40|3.08\n|26|46|3.01\n|35|57|4.41\n|44|68|4.18\n|53|77|5.00\n|63|86|4.56\n|67|89|4.59\n|64|88|3.57\n|57|81|3.14\n|44|70|2.61\n|36|56|4.23\n|26|44|4.00\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0190\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Carmi, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Carmi have ranged from a low of {{convert|22|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|89|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-20|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1994 and a record high of {{convert|103|\u00b0F}} was recorded in August 2007.

The bridge crosses the [[River Thames]] close to the [[Tower of London]] and has become an iconic symbol of London. As a result, it is sometimes confused with [[London Bridge]], about half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]], a charitable trust overseen by the [[City of London Corporation]]. It is the only one of the trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].\n\nThe bridge consists of two [[bridge tower]]s tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal [[Tension (physics)|tension]] forces imposed by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower.\n\nThe bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest [[London Underground]] tube stations are [[Tower Hill tube station|Tower Hill]] on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[District line]]s, [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] on the [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]] and [[Northern line|Northern]] lines and [[Bermondsey tube station|Bermondsey]] on the Jubilee line, and the nearest [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations|Docklands Light Railway station]] is [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]].<ref name=coltbe>{{cite web |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/Exhibition/ |title = Tower Bridge Exhibition website |publisher = Corporation of The City of London |accessdate = 18 November 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101112055741/http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/Exhibition/ |archivedate = 12 November 2010 }}</ref> The nearest [[National Rail]] stations are at [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Inception ===\n[[File:Tower bridge schm020.png|thumb|right|Elevation, with dimensions]]\nIn the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the [[East End of London]] led to demands for a new river crossing downstream of [[London Bridge]]. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by [[sailing ships]] to the port facilities in the [[Pool of London]], between London Bridge and the Tower of London.{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}\n\nA ''Special Bridge or Subway Committee'' was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution.{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|p=159}} More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]], which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. A design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a [[bascule bridge]].{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|pp=158,160}} Sir [[John Wolfe Barry]] was appointed engineer and Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] the architect  (who was also one of the judges).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=148}} An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of {{convert|61|m|ft|0|order=flip}} and a headroom of {{convert|41|m|ft|0|order=flip}}. Construction had to be in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\nBarry designed a bridge with two [[bridge tower]]s built on piers. The central [[Span (architecture)|span]] was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained in the bridge's upper walkways.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Tower bridge works 1892.jpg|left|thumb|Tower Bridge under construction, 1892]]\nConstruction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 [[John Jackson (UK politician)|Sir John Jackson]] (foundations), [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Baron Armstrong]] (hydraulics), [[William Webster (builder)|William Webster]], Sir [[Herbert Bartlett|H.H.

Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it.

At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.{{sfn|Tower Bridge|1994|p=47}}\n\nVessels passing through the bridge had to display signals too: by day, a black ball at least {{convert|2|ft|m|2}} in diameter was to be mounted high up where it could be seen; by night, two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's [[steam whistle]]. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about {{convert|1000|yd|m}} downstream, at [[Cherry Garden Pier]], where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.{{sfn|Tower Bridge|1994|p=47}}\n\nSome of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and may be seen working in the bridge's museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/Visit-Engine-Rooms/|title=Engine Rooms|website=Tower Bridge|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Traffic ==\n[[File:Cmglee Tower Bridge tall ship.jpg|thumb|right|The [[tall ship]] ''[[Wylde Swan]]'' passing under Tower Bridge decorated for the London Olympics in August 2012.

The bridge crosses the [[River Thames]] close to the [[Tower of London]] and has become an iconic symbol of London. As a result, it is sometimes confused with [[London Bridge]], about half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]], a charitable trust overseen by the [[City of London Corporation]]. It is the only one of the trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].\n\nThe bridge consists of two [[bridge tower]]s tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal [[Tension (physics)|tension]] forces imposed by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower.\n\nThe bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest [[London Underground]] tube stations are [[Tower Hill tube station|Tower Hill]] on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[District line]]s, [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] on the [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]] and [[Northern line|Northern]] lines and [[Bermondsey tube station|Bermondsey]] on the Jubilee line, and the nearest [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations|Docklands Light Railway station]] is [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]].<ref name=coltbe>{{cite web |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/Exhibition/ |title = Tower Bridge Exhibition website |publisher = Corporation of The City of London |accessdate = 18 November 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101112055741/http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/Exhibition/ |archivedate = 12 November 2010 }}</ref> The nearest [[National Rail]] stations are at [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Inception ===\n[[File:Tower bridge schm020.png|thumb|right|Elevation, with dimensions]]\nIn the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the [[East End of London]] led to demands for a new river crossing downstream of [[London Bridge]]. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by [[sailing ships]] to the port facilities in the [[Pool of London]], between London Bridge and the Tower of London.{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}\n\nA ''Special Bridge or Subway Committee'' was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution.{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|p=159}} More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]], which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. A design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a [[bascule bridge]].{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|pp=158,160}} Sir [[John Wolfe Barry]] was appointed engineer and Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] the architect  (who was also one of the judges).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=148}} An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of {{convert|61|m|ft|0|order=flip}} and a headroom of {{convert|41|m|ft|0|order=flip}}. Construction had to be in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\nBarry designed a bridge with two [[bridge tower]]s built on piers. The central [[Span (architecture)|span]] was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained in the bridge's upper walkways.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Tower bridge works 1892.jpg|left|thumb|Tower Bridge under construction, 1892]]\nConstruction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 [[John Jackson (UK politician)|Sir John Jackson]] (foundations), [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Baron Armstrong]] (hydraulics), [[William Webster (builder)|William Webster]], Sir [[Herbert Bartlett|H.H.

Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground (\"tube\") railways, but it closed after just three months and was re-opened as a pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nThe high-level open air walkways between the towers gained a reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]; as they were only accessible by stairs they were seldom used by regular pedestrians, and were closed in 1910.<ref name=\"walkway\">{{cite news|title=Tower Bridge: fascinating facts and figures|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/south-east/london-bridge/articles/Tower-Bridge-fascinating-facts-and-figures/|agency=The Telegraph|date=8 January 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Rough Guides|1998|p=152}} The walkway reopened in 1982 as part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.<ref name=\"walkway\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/vertigo-calling-walkways-at-londons-tower-bridge-outfitted-with-glass|title=Vertigo calling: Walkways at London's Tower Bridge outfitted with glass floors|first=Matt|last=Hickman|work=Mother Nature Network|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:This picture, taken during the first mass air raid on London, 7th September 1940, describes more than words ever... - NARA - 541917.tif|thumb|left|Tower Bridge during the first mass air raid on London, 7 September 1940]]\n[[File:SHort Sunderland V DP198 201.A Tower Br 16.09.56 edited-3.jpg|thumb|A [[Short Sunderland]] of [[No. 201 Squadron RAF]] moored at Tower Bridge during the 1956 commemoration of the [[Battle of Britain]]]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]] and as a precaution against the existing engines being damaged by enemy action, a third engine was installed in 1942: a 150&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] horizontal cross-compound engine, built by [[Vickers Armstrong Ltd.]] at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne.

At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.{{sfn|Tower Bridge|1994|p=47}}\n\nVessels passing through the bridge had to display signals too: by day, a black ball at least {{convert|2|ft|m|2}} in diameter was to be mounted high up where it could be seen; by night, two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's [[steam whistle]]. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about {{convert|1000|yd|m}} downstream, at [[Cherry Garden Pier]], where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.{{sfn|Tower Bridge|1994|p=47}}\n\nSome of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and may be seen working in the bridge's museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.towerbridge.org.uk/Visit-Engine-Rooms/|title=Engine Rooms|website=Tower Bridge|accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Traffic ==\n[[File:Cmglee Tower Bridge tall ship.jpg|thumb|right|The [[tall ship]] ''[[Wylde Swan]]'' passing under Tower Bridge decorated for the London Olympics in August 2012.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.

While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in [[Samar]], resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.<ref name=Damw/>\n\n==Peace talks==\nBased on the

The peace talks were carried out in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].\n\nIn February 2017, the CPP-NPA-NDF declared that they will withdraw from the ceasefire, effective on 10 February 2017, due to the unfulfilled promise by the government that it will release all 392 political prisoners. However, the communists attacked and killed 3 soldiers before the withdrawal, which angered the government and made them declare a withdrawal from the ceasefire also. The peace talks was informally terminated and an all-out war was declared by the AFP after the withdrawal.\n\nIn March 2017, the government announced a new truce and the resumption of peace talks, to take place in April.

While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in [[Samar]], resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.<ref name=Damw/>\n\n==Peace talks==\nBased on the records of the [[Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process]], the Government of the Philippines and the CPP-NPA-NDF had engaged in over 40 rounds of peace talks by November 2017.<ref name=\"Marchadesch20171124\">{{Cite news |last=Marchadesch |first=Barbara |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/ |title=TIMELINE: The peace talks between the government and the CPP-NPA-NDF, 1986 \u2013 present |date=2017-11-24 |work=GMA News Online |access-date=2020-04-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124103321/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/specialreports/634324/timeline-the-peace-talks-between-the-government-and-the-cpp-npa-ndf-1986-present/story/ |archive-date=2017-11-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Political killings in the Philippines (2001\u201310)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Communism in the Philippines}}\n{{The Marcoses}}\n{{Philippines topics}}\n{{Ongoing military conflicts}}\n{{Philippines conflicts}}\n{{Post-Cold War Asian conflicts}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion}}\n[[Category:Communism in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Communist rebellions]]\n[[Category:20th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:21st-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Ongoing insurgencies]]\n[[Category:Maoism in Asia]]\n[[Category:Insurgencies in Asia]]\n[[Category:Military history of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1965\u201386)]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1986\u2013present)]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Proxy wars]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_rebellion_in_the_Philippines"}
