She is known for her roles in the 1923 film ''[[The Green Goddess (1923 film)|The Green Goddess]]'' and its 1930 remake [[The Green Goddess (1930 film)|of the same name]].<ref>\"Alice Joyce, Star of Silent Movies, Dies.\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

She had a brother, Francis \"Frank\" Joyce (1893\u20131935), who was 2 years younger who later became an entertainment manager. Her father was a smelter of Irish and French ancestry and her mother a Welsh seamstress. Educated at a convent in Maryland, she ran away to New York while still a teenager.<ref name=gold65 />\n\nBy 1900, her parents' marriage fell apart, and her father John took custody of little Alice and Frank and moved to Falls Church, Virginia, where Joyce spent most of her childhood. According to the 1910 Census, her mother, Vallie, remarried in 1900 to Leon Faber, and they resided in the Bronx, New York, along with Alice and her brother, Frank, where she was employed as a \"photographer's model\" and appeared in [[Illustrated Songs|illustrated songs]].\n\nShe once said that film producer [[D.W. Griffith]] had told her that she \"reminded him of a cow\". Despite this unflattering comment, Joyce was a well-respected actress of the [[silent film]] era. Though D.W. Griffith did not show any interest in her, she found work modelling for both artists and photographers. One film historian ranks her among the top models of 1910, in the company of [[Mabel Normand]] and [[Anna Nilsson]]. She posed for some of the better known artists of the day: [[Harrison Fisher]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]] and [[Neysa McMein]].<ref name=gold65 />\n\n==Stardom==\n[[File:Alice Joyce Photoplay March 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Joyce on the cover of ''[[Photoplay]]'', 1920]]\nIt was director [[Sidney Olcott]] at the [[Kalem Company]] in New York City who gave Alice Joyce her first chance, casting her in his 1910 production ''The Deacon's Daughter''. She was sent to work under director [[Kenean Buel]] on the West Coast after Kalem acquired the old [[Essanay Studios]] property in East Hollywood in October 1913. Joyce spent time with Kalem (1910\u20131915) and [[Vitagraph]] (1916\u20131921), later working as independent for various studios. Her stardom began to wane with the advent of sound motion pictures.\n{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n==Marriages==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 160\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Tom Moore - Feb 5 1920 EH.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Husband [[Tom Moore (actor)|Tom Moore]] with the couple's daughter Alice, 1920\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Alice Joyce & Husband 1921.jpg \n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joyce and husband James B.

The same year she married James B. Regan, son of the managing director of the old [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]]; her second daughter was born during this union. They divorced in 1932, shortly after which the actress declared bankruptcy before she married for a third time. Her last marriage came in 1933 in Virginia City, Nevada to film director [[Clarence Brown]]; they separated in 1942 and divorced in 1945. The actress retained Brown's name.<ref>New York Times.

She made her last movie in 1930, after which she and ex-husband Tom Moore worked a late [[vaudeville]] circuit for a time. She declared voluntary bankruptcy in 1933.<ref>Pittsburgh Press.

On her death in 1955, Alice Joyce was interred next to her mother Vallie in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in Mission Hills, California. Alice Joyce had two daughters: Mrs. Alice Moore de Tolley of Dover, Delaware and Mrs. Peggy Harris of Clark Fork, Idaho.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} She left an estate valued at $175,000, with a gross income of approximately $27,600. Her daughters received a collection of jewelry, including an eight-carat (1.6 g) emerald-cut diamond ring and a 55 carat (11 g) star sapphire ring. The remainder of the estate was placed in trust under terms of the will.

She is known for her roles in the 1923 film ''[[The Green Goddess (1923 film)|The Green Goddess]]'' and its 1930 remake [[The Green Goddess (1930 film)|of the same name]].<ref>\"Alice Joyce, Star of Silent Movies, Dies.\" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

McFarland&Company, {{ISBN|0786408340}}, 2001, p.&nbsp;65.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAlice Joyce was born in Kansas City, Missouri to John Edward and Vallie Olive McIntyre Joyce (1873\u20131938). She had a brother, Francis \"Frank\" Joyce (1893\u20131935), who was 2 years younger who later became an entertainment manager. Her father was a smelter of Irish and French ancestry and her mother a Welsh seamstress. Educated at a convent in Maryland, she ran away to New York while still a teenager.<ref name=gold65 />\n\nBy 1900, her parents' marriage fell apart, and her father John took custody of little Alice and Frank and moved to Falls Church, Virginia, where Joyce spent most of her childhood. According to the 1910 Census, her mother, Vallie, remarried in 1900 to Leon Faber, and they resided in the Bronx, New York, along with Alice and her brother, Frank, where she was employed as a \"photographer's model\" and appeared in [[Illustrated Songs|illustrated songs]].\n\nShe once said that film producer [[D.W. Griffith]] had told her that she \"reminded him of a cow\". Despite this unflattering comment, Joyce was a well-respected actress of the [[silent film]] era. Though D.W. Griffith did not show any interest in her, she found work modelling for both artists and photographers. One film historian ranks her among the top models of 1910, in the company of [[Mabel Normand]] and [[Anna Nilsson]]. She posed for some of the better known artists of the day: [[Harrison Fisher]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]] and [[Neysa McMein]].<ref name=gold65 />\n\n==Stardom==\n[[File:Alice Joyce Photoplay March 1920.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Joyce on the cover of ''[[Photoplay]]'', 1920]]\nIt was director [[Sidney Olcott]] at the [[Kalem Company]] in New York City who gave Alice Joyce her first chance, casting her in his 1910 production ''The Deacon's Daughter''. She was sent to work under director [[Kenean Buel]] on the West Coast after Kalem acquired the old [[Essanay Studios]] property in East Hollywood in October 1913. Joyce spent time with Kalem (1910\u20131915) and [[Vitagraph]] (1916\u20131921), later working as independent for various studios. Her stardom began to wane with the advent of sound motion pictures.\n{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n==Marriages==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 160\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Tom Moore - Feb 5 1920 EH.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Husband [[Tom Moore (actor)|Tom Moore]] with the couple's daughter Alice, 1920\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Alice Joyce & Husband 1921.jpg \n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joyce and husband James B.

The same year she married James B. Regan, son of the managing director of the old [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]]; her second daughter was born during this union. They divorced in 1932, shortly after which the actress declared bankruptcy before she married for a third time. Her last marriage came in 1933 in Virginia City, Nevada to film director [[Clarence Brown]]; they separated in 1942 and divorced in 1945. The actress retained Brown's name.<ref>New York Times.

In 1946, after Joyce was seriously injured in a traffic accident, Brown remained with her for nine hours and paid her medical bills.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n==Retirement==\nJoyce was known as \"The Madonna of the Screen\" for her striking features and presence. She made her last movie in 1930, after which she and ex-husband Tom Moore worked a late [[vaudeville]] circuit for a time. She declared voluntary bankruptcy in 1933.<ref>Pittsburgh Press. ''Alice Joyce Broke''. April 1. 1933. p 2. Web. October 18. 2010</ref> Joyce was active in women's organizations in the [[San Fernando Valley]] in her later years. She did book reviews and made sketches for friends.\n\nThe actress was ill for several years before her death from a blood and heart ailment at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital. She was 65 years old. On her death in 1955, Alice Joyce was interred next to her mother Vallie in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in Mission Hills, California. Alice Joyce had two daughters: Mrs. Alice Moore de Tolley of Dover, Delaware and Mrs. Peggy Harris of Clark Fork, Idaho.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} She left an estate valued at $175,000, with a gross income of approximately $27,600. Her daughters received a collection of jewelry, including an eight-carat (1.6 g) emerald-cut diamond ring and a 55 carat (11 g) star sapphire ring. The remainder of the estate was placed in trust under terms of the will. The income from this was divided equally between Joyce's daughters. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 160\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    =The Strange Story of Elsie Mason poster.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Poster for Kalem's ''The Strange Story of Elsie Mason'' (1912)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Alice Joyce Motion Picture Classic November 1916.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joyce on the cover of ''Motion Picture Classic'' in 1916, the year she joined Vitagraph Studios\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =Alice Joyce 1919.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Advertisement for ''[[The Spark Divine]]'' (1919)\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =Dollars and the Woman (1920) - 1.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Joyce and [[Robert Gordon (actor)|Robert Gordon]] in ''Dollars and the Woman'' (1920)\n<!-- Image 5 -->\n| image5    =Alice Joyce post card Cousin Kate.jpg\n| alt5      =\n| caption5  = Joyce in ''[[Cousin Kate (1921 film)|Cousin Kate]]'' (1921)\n<!-- Image 6 -->\n| image6    =White Man - film poster.jpg\n| alt6      =\n| caption6  = Poster for ''[[White Man (film)|White Man]]'' (1924)\n<!-- Image 7 -->\n| image7    =Stella-dallas-lobby-1925.jpg\n| alt7      =\n| caption7  = [[Lobby card]] showing [[Ronald Colman]], [[Lois Moran]] and Joyce in ''[[Stella Dallas (1925 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1925)\n<!-- Image 8 -->\n| image8    =Alicejoyce1926full crop.jpg\n| alt8      =\n| caption8  = Joyce in 1926\n<!-- Image 9 -->\n| image9    =Dancing Mothers lobby card.jpg\n| alt9      =\n| caption9  = Lobby card showing Joyce and [[Clara Bow]] in ''[[Dancing Mothers]]'' (1926)\n<!-- Image 10 -->\n| image10    =So's Your Old Man lobby card.jpg\n| alt10      =\n| caption10  = Lobby card with Joyce and [[W.C.

The main competitor of this family is [[macOS]] by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for personal computers and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for mobile devices (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}}).\n** [[Windows Server]]: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is [[Windows Server 2019]]. Unlike its client sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this family is [[Linux]]. (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer.

NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, [[multi-user]] operating system with [[POSIX]] compatibility and a modular, [[Software portability|portable]] [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] with [[preemptive multitasking]] and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of [[Windows 3.0]], the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended [[32-bit]] port of the [[Windows API]] known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows [[API]]s (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be [[Porting|ported]] to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.<ref name=\"insident\">{{cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | url= https://archive.org/details/insidewindowsnt00cust | url-access= registration | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | isbn=1-55615-481-X}}</ref><ref name=\"thurrott-nt\"/>\n\nThe first release of the resulting operating system, [[Windows NT 3.1]] (named to associate it with [[Windows 3.1]]) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]].

Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to [[OEM]]s and device makers. The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.\n\nWindows CE was used in the [[Dreamcast]] along with Sega's own proprietary OS for the console. Windows CE was the core from which [[Windows Mobile]] was derived. Its successor, [[Windows Phone 7]], was based on components from both [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0|Windows CE 6.0 R3]] and [[Windows Embedded Compact 7|Windows CE 7.0]]. [[Windows Phone 8]] however, is based on the same NT-kernel as Windows 8.\n\nWindows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with [[Windows XP Embedded]] or [[Windows NT 4.0 Embedded]], modular editions of Windows based on Windows NT kernel.\n\n===Xbox OS===\n{{Main|Xbox One system software|Xbox 360 system software}}\nXbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on the [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7528/the-xbox-one-mini-review-hardware-analysis|title=The Xbox One - Mini Review & Comparison to Xbox 360/PS4|author=Anand Lal Shimpi|work=anandtech.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012063931/http://www.anandtech.com/show/7528/the-xbox-one-mini-review-hardware-analysis|archivedate=October 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is a more specific implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using [[Hyper-V]]) as it is three operating systems running at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment for applications.<ref name=\"xboxonethreesystems\">{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/156467-xbox-one-hardware-and-software-specs-detailed-and-analyzed|title=Xbox One: Hardware and software specs detailed and analyzed - Three operating systems in one|publisher=ExtremeTech|accessdate=December 1, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116221155/http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/156467-xbox-one-hardware-and-software-specs-detailed-and-analyzed|archivedate=November 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nMicrosoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC.<ref>{{cite web|website=Xbox Official Site|url=http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool|title=How to use the Offline System Update Diagnostic Tool on Xbox One|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> The Windows 10-based Core had replaced the Windows 8-based one in this update, and the new system is sometimes referred to as \"Windows 10 on Xbox One\" or \"OneCore\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-is-literally-a-windows-device/1100-6430425/|title=Xbox One Is \"Literally a Windows Device\"|work=GameSpot|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227060719/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-is-literally-a-windows-device/1100-6430425/|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-one-update-will-make-some-functionality-5/1100-6430524/|title=New Xbox One Update Will Make Some Functionality 50 Percent Faster|work=GameSpot|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202102914/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-one-update-will-make-some-functionality-5/1100-6430524/|archivedate=February 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nXbox One's system also allows backward compatibility with Xbox 360,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8786501/microsoft-xbox-one-dashboard-update-features|title=Xbox One dashboard update includes a huge new design and Cortana|author=Tom Warren|date=June 16, 2015|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708210651/https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8786501/microsoft-xbox-one-dashboard-update-features|archivedate=July 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the Xbox 360's system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/f/x360bcfaq.htm|title=Xbox 360 and Xbox Games Backwards Compatibility|author=Eric Qualls|work=About.com Tech|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928070914/http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/f/x360bcfaq.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Version control system==\nIn 2017, Microsoft announced that it would start using [[Git]], an open source version control system created by [[Linus Torvalds]]. Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

The main competitor of this family is [[macOS]] by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for personal computers and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for mobile devices (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}}).\n** [[Windows Server]]: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is [[Windows Server 2019]]. Unlike its client sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this family is [[Linux]]. (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, [[multi-user]] operating system with [[POSIX]] compatibility and a modular, [[Software portability|portable]] [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] with [[preemptive multitasking]] and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of [[Windows 3.0]], the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended [[32-bit]] port of the [[Windows API]] known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows [[API]]s (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be [[Porting|ported]] to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.<ref name=\"insident\">{{cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | url= https://archive.org/details/insidewindowsnt00cust | url-access= registration | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | isbn=1-55615-481-X}}</ref><ref name=\"thurrott-nt\"/>\n\nThe first release of the resulting operating system, [[Windows NT 3.1]] (named to associate it with [[Windows 3.1]]) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. [[Windows NT 3.5]] was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for [[Novell]]'s [[NetWare]], and was followed up by [[Windows NT 3.51]] in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the [[PowerPC]] architecture. [[Windows NT 4.0]] was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of [[Windows 95]] to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]], a successor to NT 4.0.

The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

{"title_page": "Swap (finance)", "text_new": "{{Financial markets}}\nA '''swap''', in [[finance]], is an agreement between two [[counterparty|counterparties]] to [[trade|exchange]] [[financial instrument|financial instruments]] or cashflows or payments for a certain time.  The instruments can be almost anything but most swaps involve cash based on a notional principal amount.<ref name=\"FIBO2\">[https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/About-EDMC-FIBO/ Financial Industry Business Ontology Version 2], Annex D: Derivatives, EDM Council, Inc., Object Management Group, Inc., 2019</ref><ref name=\"Investopedia\">{{cite web|title=What is a swap?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp?ad=dirN&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&qsrc=0&o=40186|website=Investopedia|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe general swap can also be seen as a series of forward contracts through which two parties exchange financial instruments, resulting in a common series of exchange dates and two streams of instruments, the ''legs'' of the swap.  The legs can be almost anything but usually one leg involves cash flows based on a [[notional principal amount]] that both parties agree to.  This principal usually does not change hands during or at the end of the swap;\nthis is ''contrary'' to a [[futures contract|future]], a [[forward contract|forward]] or an [[option (finance)|option]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bp_vAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 ''Finance: A Quantitative Introduction'' by Piotr Staszkiewicz and Lucia Staszkiewicz; Academic Press 2014, pg. 56.]</ref>\n\nIn practice one leg is generally fixed while the other is variable, that is determined by an uncertain variable such as a benchmark interest rate, a [[foreign exchange rate]], an index price, or a commodity price.<ref name=\"hull\">John C Hull'', Options, Futures and Other Derivatives (6th edition)'', New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2006, 149</ref>\n\nSwaps are primarily [[Over-the-counter_(finance)|over-the-counter contracts]] between companies or financial institutions.

Another mortgage holder is paying a [[Fixed interest|fixed rate]] but expects rates to fall in the future.  They enter a fixed-for-floating swap agreement.  Both mortgage holders agree on a [[notional principal amount]] and [[Maturity (finance)|maturity date]] and agree to take on each other's payment obligations. The first mortgage holder from now on is paying a fixed rate to the second mortgage holder while receiving a floating rate.  By using a swap both parties effectively changed their mortgage terms to their preferred interest mode while neither party had to renegotiate terms with their mortgage lenders.\n\nConsidering the next payment only, both parties might as well have entered a fixed-for-floating [[forward contract]].  For the payment after that another forward contract whose terms are the same, i.e. same notional amount and fixed-for-floating, and so on.  The swap contract therefore can be seen as a series of forward contracts.  In the end there are two streams of [[cash flows]], one from the party who is always paying a fixed interest on the notional amount, the ''fixed leg'' of the swap, the other from the party who agreed to pay the floating rate, the ''floating leg''.\n\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=chicagofed.org|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th |authorlink= |last=Ross|last2=Westerfield|last3=Jordan |last-author-amp=yes|year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding was more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1711.htm|title=OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2017|date=2017-11-02|website=www.bis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nMost swaps are traded [[Derivative (finance)#OTC and exchange-traded|over-the-counter]] (OTC), \"tailor-made\" for the counterparties.

It maintains a substantial position in swaps for any of the major swap categories.  A swap bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. A swap bank serves as either a swap broker or swap dealer. As a broker, the swap bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the swap. The swap broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most swap banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market maker, a swap bank is willing to accept either side of a currency swap, and then later on-sell it, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the swap bank assumes a position in the swap and therefore assumes some risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the swap bank would receive a portion of the [[cash flows]] passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.<ref name=\"FIBO2\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Intermediaries |url=https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/index.htm |website=U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Swap market efficiency==\nThe two primary reasons for a counterparty to use a currency swap are to obtain debt financing in the swapped currency at an interest cost reduction brought about through [[comparative advantages]] each counterparty has in its national [[capital market]], and/or the benefit of hedging long-run [[exchange rate]] exposure. These reasons seem straightforward and difficult to argue with, especially to the extent that name recognition is truly important in raising funds in the international [[bond market]].  Firms using currency swaps have statistically higher levels of long-term foreign-denominated debt than firms that use no currency derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geczy |first1=C. |last2=Minton |first2=B. |last3=Schrand |first3=C. |title=Why firms use currency derivatives |journal=Journal of Finance |date=1997 |issue=52 |pages=1323-1354}}</ref>  Conversely, the primary users of currency swaps are non-financial, global firms with long-term foreign-currency financing needs.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\">{{cite journal |last1=Goswami |first1=G. |last2=Nam |first2=J. |last3=Shrikhande |first3=M. |title=Why do global firms use currency swaps?: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Multinational Financial Management |date=2004 |volume=14 |issue=4-5 |pages=315-334}}</ref>  From a foreign investor's perspective, valuation of foreign-currency debt would exclude the ''exposure effect'' that a domestic investor would see for such debt.  Financing foreign-currency debt using domestic currency and a currency swap is therefore superior to financing directly with foreign-currency debt.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\"/>\n\nThe two primary reasons for swapping interest rates are to better match maturities of assets and liabilities and/or to obtain a cost savings via the [[quality spread differential]] (QSD).  Empirical evidence suggests that the spread between AAA-rated commercial paper (floating) and A-rated commercial is slightly less than the spread between AAA-rated five-year obligation (fixed) and an A-rated obligation of the same tenor.  These findings suggest that firms with lower (higher) credit ratings are more likely to pay fixed (floating) in swaps, and fixed-rate payers would use more short-term debt and have shorter debt maturity than floating-rate payers.  In particular, the A-rated firm would borrow using commercial paper at a spread over the AAA rate and enter into a (short-term) fixed-for-floating swap as payer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=H. |last2=Mao |first2=C. |title=Corporate use of interest rate swaps: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Banking & Finance |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1511-1538 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00275-3}}</ref>\n\n==Types of swaps==\nThe generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[basis swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, [[inflation swap]]s, [[credit default swap]]s, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s. There are also many other types of swaps.\n\n===Interest rate swaps===\n{{main|Interest rate swap}}\n[[File:Vanilla interest rate swap with bank.png|400px|right|thumb|A is currently paying floating, but wants to pay fixed. B is currently paying fixed but wants to pay floating. By entering into an interest rate swap, the net result is that each party can 'swap' their existing obligation for their desired obligation. Normally, the parties do not swap payments directly, but rather each sets up a separate swap with a financial intermediary such as a bank. In return for matching the two parties together, the bank takes a spread from the swap payments.]]\nThe most common type of swap is an interest rate swap. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets, while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow, they look for cheap borrowing, i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However, this may lead to a company borrowing fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming a fixed rate loan into a floating rate loan or vice versa.\n\nFor example, party B makes periodic interest payments to party A based on a ''variable'' interest rate of [[LIBOR]] +70 [[basis point]]s. Party A in return makes periodic interest payments based on a fixed rate of 8.65%. The payments are calculated over the [[notional amount|''notional'' amount]]. The first rate is called ''variable'' because it is reset at the beginning of each interest calculation period to the then current [[reference rate]], such as [[LIBOR]]. In reality, the actual rate received by A and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.\n\n===Basis swaps===\n{{main|Basis swap}}\nA basis swap involves exchanging floating interest rates based on different money markets.  The principal is not exchanged.  The swap effectively limits the interest-rate risk as a result of having differing lending and borrowing rates.<ref>[https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/About-EDMC-FIBO/ Financial Industry Business Ontology Version 2], Annex D: Derivatives, EDM Council, Inc., Object Management Group, Inc., 2019</ref>\n\n===Currency swaps===\n{{main|Currency swap}}\nA currency swap involves exchanging principal and fixed rate interest payments on a loan in one currency for principal and fixed rate interest payments on an equal loan in another currency.\nJust like interest rate swaps, the currency swaps are also motivated by [[comparative advantage]].\nCurrency swaps entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cashflows in one direction\nbeing in a different currency than those in the opposite direction. It is also a very crucial uniform pattern in individuals and customers.\n\n===Inflation swaps===\n{{main|Inflation swap}}\nAn inflation-linked swap involves exchanging a fixed rate on a principal for an inflation index expressed in monetary terms.  The primary objective is to hedge against inflation and interest-rate risk.<ref>[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/04/how-liquid-is-the-inflation-swap-market.html How Liquid Is the Inflation Swap Market?]  Michael J. Fleming and John Sporn, 2013</ref>\n\n===Commodity swaps===\n{{main|Commodity swap}}\nA commodity swap is an agreement whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. The vast majority of commodity swaps involve [[Petroleum#Crude oil|crude oil]].\n\n===Credit Default Swap===\n{{main|Credit default swap}}\nAn agreement whereby the payer periodically pays premiums, sometimes also or only a one-off or initial premium, to the protection seller on a notional principal for a period of time so long as a specified [[credit event]] has not occurred.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\">Frank J. Fabozzi, 2018.

In the event of default, the payer receives compensation, for example the principal, possibly plus all fixed rate payments until the end of the swap agreement, or any other way that suits the protection buyer or both counterparties.  The primary objective of a CDS is to transfer one party's credit exposure to another party.\n\n===Subordinated risk swaps===\nA subordinated risk swap (SRS), or equity risk swap, is a contract in which the ''buyer'' (or equity holder) pays a premium to the ''seller'' (or silent holder) for the option to transfer certain risks. These can include any form of equity, management or legal risk of the [[underlying]] (for example a [[company]]). Through execution the equity holder can (for example) transfer shares, management responsibilities or else. Thus, general and special entrepreneurial risks can be managed, assigned or prematurely hedged. Those instruments are traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and there are only a few specialized investors worldwide.\n\n===Equity swap===\n{{main|Equity swap}}\nAn agreement to exchange future cash flows between two parties where one leg is an equity-based cash flow such as the performance of a stock asset, a basket of stocks or a stock index.  The other leg is typically a fixed-income cash flow such as a benchmark interest rate.\n\n===Other variations===\nThere are myriad different variations on the vanilla swap structure, which are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n* A '''[[total return swap]]''' is a swap in which party A pays the ''total return'' of an [[asset]], and party B makes periodic interest payments. The total return is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or dividend payments. Note that if the total return is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to the return of the underlying stock or index, without having to hold the [[underlying]] assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the underlying asset.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* An [[option (finance)|option]] on a swap is called a '''[[swaption]]'''. These provide one party with the right but not the obligation at a future time to enter into a swap.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''[[variance swap]]''' is an over-the-counter instrument that allows investors to trade future realized (or historical) volatility against current implied volatility.<ref>[https://wilmott.com/introduction-to-variance-swaps-wilmott-magazine-article-sebastien-bossu/ Introduction to Variance Swaps], Sebastien Bossu, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Wilmott Magazine, 16th April 2018</ref>\n* A '''[[constant maturity swap]]''' (CMS) is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the [[Bond duration|duration]] of received flows on a swap.\n* An '''[[Amortising swap|amortizing swap]]''' is usually an [[interest rate swap]] in which the notional principal for the interest payments declines during the life of the swap, perhaps at a rate tied to the prepayment of a mortgage or to an interest rate benchmark such as the LIBOR. It is suitable to those customers of banks who want to manage the interest rate risk involved in predicted funding requirement, or investment programs.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''zero coupon swap''' is of use to those entities which have their liabilities denominated in floating rates but at the same time would like to conserve cash for operational purposes.\n* A '''deferred rate swap''' is particularly attractive to those users of funds that need funds immediately but do not consider the current rates of interest very attractive and feel that the rates may fall in future.\n* An '''accreting swap''' is used by banks which have agreed to lend increasing sums over time to its customers so that they may fund projects.\n* A '''forward swap''' is an agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in duration for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a forward start swap, delayed start swap, and a deferred start swap.\n* A '''[[Quanto|quanto swap]]''' is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap in which one counterparty pays a foreign interest rate to the other, but the notional amount is in domestic currency. The second party may be paying a fixed or floating rate. For example, a swap in which the notional amount is denominated in Canadian dollars, but where the floating rate is set as USD LIBOR, would be considered a quanto swap.  Quanto swaps are known as ''differential'' or ''rate-differential'' or ''diff'' swaps.\n* A '''range accrual swap''' (or '''range accrual note''') is an agreement to pay a fixed or floating rate while receiving cash flows from a fixed or floating rate which are accrued only on those days where the second rate falls within a preagreed range.  The received payments are maximized when the second rate stays entirely within the range for the duration of the swap.\n* A '''three-zone digital''' swap is a generalization of the range accrual swap, the payer of a fixed rate receives a floating rate if that rate stays within a certain preagreed range, or a fixed rate if the floating rate goes above the range, or a different fixed rate if the floating rate falls below the range.\n\n==Valuation and Pricing==\n{{main|Rational pricing#Swaps|Arbitrage}}\n{{further|Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing||Asset swap#Computing the asset swap spread|Credit default swap#Pricing and valuation|Currency swap#Valuation and Pricing|Variance swap#Pricing and valuation}}\n\nThe value of a swap is the [[net present value]] (NPV) of all ''expected'' future cash flows, essentially the difference in leg values. \nA swap is thus \"worth zero\" when it is first initiated, otherwise one party would be at an advantage, and arbitrage would be possible; \nhowever after this time its value may become positive or negative.<ref name=\"hull\"/> \n\nWhile this principle holds true for any swap, the following discussion is for plain vanilla interest rate swaps and is representative of pure rational pricing as it excludes [[credit risk]]. \nFor interest rate swaps, there are in fact two methods, which will (must) return the same value: \nin terms of [[Bond (finance)|bond]] prices, or as a portfolio of [[forward contract]]s.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\nThe fact that these methods agree, underscores the fact that rational pricing will apply ''between'' instruments also.\n<!-- In practice\u2014especially since the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]]\u2014swaps are priced using a \"multi-curve\" framework; see [[Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing]] for formulae, and [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing]] for context. --> \n===Arbitrage arguments===\nAs mentioned, to be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the NPV of these future cash flows is equal to zero. Where this is not the case, arbitrage would be possible.\n\nFor example, consider a plain vanilla fixed-to-floating interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate, and Party B pays a floating rate. In such an agreement the ''fixed rate'' would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A are equal to the present value of the ''expected'' future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Where this is not the case, an [[Arbitrage]]ur, C, could:\n# assume the position with the ''lower'' present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value\n# meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments - which have a higher present value\n# use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds\n# pocket the difference - where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit.\n\nSubsequently, once traded, the price of the Swap must equate to the price of the various corresponding instruments as mentioned above. Where this is not true, an arbitrageur could similarly [[short (finance)|short sell]] the overpriced instrument, and use the proceeds to purchase the correctly priced instrument, pocket the difference, and then use payments generated to service the instrument which he is short.\n===Using bond prices===\nWhile principal payments are not exchanged in an interest rate swap, assuming that these are received and paid at the end of the swap does not change its value. Thus, from the point of view of the floating-rate payer, a swap is equivalent to a long position in a [[fixed-rate bond]] (i.e. ''receiving'' fixed interest payments), and a short position in a [[floating rate note]] (i.e. ''making'' floating interest payments):\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{fixed} - B_\\mathrm{floating} \\, </math>\n\nFrom the point of view of the fixed-rate payer, the swap can be viewed as having the opposite positions. That is,\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{floating} - B_\\mathrm{fixed} \\, </math>\n\nSimilarly, currency swaps can be regarded as having positions in bonds whose cash flows correspond to those in the swap.

The legs can be almost anything but usually one leg involves cash flows based on a [[notional principal amount]] that both parties agree to.

Another mortgage holder is paying a [[Fixed interest|fixed rate]] but expects rates to fall in the future.  They enter a fixed-for-floating swap agreement.  Both mortgage holders agree on a [[notional principal amount]] and [[Maturity (finance)|maturity date]] and agree to take on each other's payment obligations. The first mortgage holder from now on is paying a fixed rate to the second mortgage holder while receiving a floating rate.  By using a swap both parties effectively changed their mortgage terms to their preferred interest mode while neither party had to renegotiate terms with their mortgage lenders.\n\nConsidering the next payment only, both parties might as well have entered a fixed-for-floating [[forward contract]].  For the payment after that another forward contract whose terms are the same, i.e. same notional amount and fixed-for-floating, and so on.  The swap contract therefore can be seen as a series of forward contracts.  In the end there are two streams of [[cash flows]], one from the party who is always paying a fixed interest on the notional amount, the ''fixed leg'' of the swap, the other from the party who agreed to pay the floating rate, the ''floating leg''.\n\nSwaps can be used to [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks such as [[interest rate risk]], or to [[speculation|speculate]] on changes in the expected direction of underlying prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=chicagofed.org|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSwaps were first introduced to the public in 1981 when [[IBM]] and the [[World Bank]] entered into a swap agreement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th |authorlink= |last=Ross|last2=Westerfield|last3=Jordan |last-author-amp=yes|year=2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Today, swaps are among the most heavily traded financial contracts in the world: the total amount of interest rates and currency swaps outstanding was more than $348 trillion in 2010, according to [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1711.htm|title=OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2017|date=2017-11-02|website=www.bis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nMost swaps are traded [[Derivative (finance)#OTC and exchange-traded|over-the-counter]] (OTC), \"tailor-made\" for the counterparties.

It maintains a substantial position in swaps for any of the major swap categories.  A swap bank can be an international commercial bank, an investment bank, a merchant bank, or an independent operator. A swap bank serves as either a swap broker or swap dealer. As a broker, the swap bank matches counterparties but does not assume any risk of the swap. The swap broker receives a commission for this service. Today, most swap banks serve as dealers or market makers. As a market maker, a swap bank is willing to accept either side of a currency swap, and then later on-sell it, or match it with a counterparty. In this capacity, the swap bank assumes a position in the swap and therefore assumes some risks. The dealer capacity is obviously more risky, and the swap bank would receive a portion of the [[cash flows]] passed through it to compensate it for bearing this risk.<ref name=\"FIBO2\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Intermediaries |url=https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/Intermediaries/index.htm |website=U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Swap market efficiency==\nThe two primary reasons for a counterparty to use a currency swap are to obtain debt financing in the swapped currency at an interest cost reduction brought about through [[comparative advantages]] each counterparty has in its national [[capital market]], and/or the benefit of hedging long-run [[exchange rate]] exposure. These reasons seem straightforward and difficult to argue with, especially to the extent that name recognition is truly important in raising funds in the international [[bond market]].  Firms using currency swaps have statistically higher levels of long-term foreign-denominated debt than firms that use no currency derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geczy |first1=C. |last2=Minton |first2=B. |last3=Schrand |first3=C. |title=Why firms use currency derivatives |journal=Journal of Finance |date=1997 |issue=52 |pages=1323-1354}}</ref>  Conversely, the primary users of currency swaps are non-financial, global firms with long-term foreign-currency financing needs.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\">{{cite journal |last1=Goswami |first1=G. |last2=Nam |first2=J. |last3=Shrikhande |first3=M. |title=Why do global firms use currency swaps?: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Multinational Financial Management |date=2004 |volume=14 |issue=4-5 |pages=315-334}}</ref>  From a foreign investor's perspective, valuation of foreign-currency debt would exclude the ''exposure effect'' that a domestic investor would see for such debt.  Financing foreign-currency debt using domestic currency and a currency swap is therefore superior to financing directly with foreign-currency debt.<ref name=\"why-currency-swap\"/>\n\nThe two primary reasons for swapping interest rates are to better match maturities of assets and liabilities and/or to obtain a cost savings via the [[quality spread differential]] (QSD).  Empirical evidence suggests that the spread between AAA-rated commercial paper (floating) and A-rated commercial is slightly less than the spread between AAA-rated five-year obligation (fixed) and an A-rated obligation of the same tenor.  These findings suggest that firms with lower (higher) credit ratings are more likely to pay fixed (floating) in swaps, and fixed-rate payers would use more short-term debt and have shorter debt maturity than floating-rate payers.  In particular, the A-rated firm would borrow using commercial paper at a spread over the AAA rate and enter into a (short-term) fixed-for-floating swap as payer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=H. |last2=Mao |first2=C. |title=Corporate use of interest rate swaps: Theory and evidence |journal=Journal of Banking & Finance |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1511-1538 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00275-3}}</ref>\n\n==Types of swaps==\nThe generic types of swaps, in order of their quantitative importance, are: [[interest rate swap]]s, [[basis swap]]s, [[currency swap]]s, [[inflation swap]]s, [[credit default swap]]s, [[commodity swap]]s and [[equity swap]]s. There are also many other types of swaps.\n\n===Interest rate swaps===\n{{main|Interest rate swap}}\n[[File:Vanilla interest rate swap with bank.png|400px|right|thumb|A is currently paying floating, but wants to pay fixed. B is currently paying fixed but wants to pay floating. By entering into an interest rate swap, the net result is that each party can 'swap' their existing obligation for their desired obligation. Normally, the parties do not swap payments directly, but rather each sets up a separate swap with a financial intermediary such as a bank. In return for matching the two parties together, the bank takes a spread from the swap payments.]]\nThe most common type of swap is an interest rate swap. Some companies may have comparative advantage in fixed rate markets, while other companies have a comparative advantage in floating rate markets. When companies want to borrow, they look for cheap borrowing, i.e. from the market where they have comparative advantage. However, this may lead to a company borrowing fixed when it wants floating or borrowing floating when it wants fixed. This is where a swap comes in. A swap has the effect of transforming a fixed rate loan into a floating rate loan or vice versa.\n\nFor example, party B makes periodic interest payments to party A based on a ''variable'' interest rate of [[LIBOR]] +70 [[basis point]]s. Party A in return makes periodic interest payments based on a fixed rate of 8.65%. The payments are calculated over the [[notional amount|''notional'' amount]]. The first rate is called ''variable'' because it is reset at the beginning of each interest calculation period to the then current [[reference rate]], such as [[LIBOR]]. In reality, the actual rate received by A and B is slightly lower due to a bank taking a spread.\n\n===Basis swaps===\n{{main|Basis swap}}\nA basis swap involves exchanging floating interest rates based on different money markets.  The principal is not exchanged.  The swap effectively limits the interest-rate risk as a result of having differing lending and borrowing rates.<ref>[https://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/About-EDMC-FIBO/ Financial Industry Business Ontology Version 2], Annex D: Derivatives, EDM Council, Inc., Object Management Group, Inc., 2019</ref>\n\n===Currency swaps===\n{{main|Currency swap}}\nA currency swap involves exchanging principal and fixed rate interest payments on a loan in one currency for principal and fixed rate interest payments on an equal loan in another currency.\nJust like interest rate swaps, the currency swaps are also motivated by [[comparative advantage]].\nCurrency swaps entail swapping both principal and interest between the parties, with the cashflows in one direction\nbeing in a different currency than those in the opposite direction. It is also a very crucial uniform pattern in individuals and customers.\n\n===Inflation swaps===\n{{main|Inflation swap}}\nAn inflation-linked swap involves exchanging a fixed rate on a principal for an inflation index expressed in monetary terms.  The primary objective is to hedge against inflation and interest-rate risk.<ref>[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/04/how-liquid-is-the-inflation-swap-market.html How Liquid Is the Inflation Swap Market?]  Michael J. Fleming and John Sporn, 2013</ref>\n\n===Commodity swaps===\n{{main|Commodity swap}}\nA commodity swap is an agreement whereby a floating (or market or spot) price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. The vast majority of commodity swaps involve [[Petroleum#Crude oil|crude oil]].\n\n===Credit Default Swap===\n{{main|Credit default swap}}\nAn agreement whereby the payer periodically pays premiums, sometimes also or only a one-off or initial premium, to the protection seller on a notional principal for a period of time so long as a specified [[credit event]] has not occurred.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\">Frank J. Fabozzi, 2018.

In the event of default, the payer receives compensation, for example the principal, possibly plus all fixed rate payments until the end of the swap agreement, or any other way that suits the protection buyer or both counterparties.  The primary objective of a CDS is to transfer one party's credit exposure to another party.\n\n===Subordinated risk swaps===\nA subordinated risk swap (SRS), or equity risk swap, is a contract in which the ''buyer'' (or equity holder) pays a premium to the ''seller'' (or silent holder) for the option to transfer certain risks. These can include any form of equity, management or legal risk of the [[underlying]] (for example a [[company]]). Through execution the equity holder can (for example) transfer shares, management responsibilities or else. Thus, general and special entrepreneurial risks can be managed, assigned or prematurely hedged. Those instruments are traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and there are only a few specialized investors worldwide.\n\n===Equity swap===\n{{main|Equity swap}}\nAn agreement to exchange future cash flows between two parties where one leg is an equity-based cash flow such as the performance of a stock asset, a basket of stocks or a stock index.  The other leg is typically a fixed-income cash flow such as a benchmark interest rate.\n\n===Other variations===\nThere are myriad different variations on the vanilla swap structure, which are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\n* A '''[[total return swap]]''' is a swap in which party A pays the ''total return'' of an [[asset]], and party B makes periodic interest payments. The total return is the capital gain or loss, plus any interest or dividend payments. Note that if the total return is negative, then party A receives this amount from party B. The parties have exposure to the return of the underlying stock or index, without having to hold the [[underlying]] assets. The profit or loss of party B is the same for him as actually owning the underlying asset.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* An [[option (finance)|option]] on a swap is called a '''[[swaption]]'''. These provide one party with the right but not the obligation at a future time to enter into a swap.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''[[variance swap]]''' is an over-the-counter instrument that allows investors to trade future realized (or historical) volatility against current implied volatility.<ref>[https://wilmott.com/introduction-to-variance-swaps-wilmott-magazine-article-sebastien-bossu/ Introduction to Variance Swaps], Sebastien Bossu, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Wilmott Magazine, 16th April 2018</ref>\n* A '''[[constant maturity swap]]''' (CMS) is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the [[Bond duration|duration]] of received flows on a swap.\n* An '''[[Amortising swap|amortizing swap]]''' is usually an [[interest rate swap]] in which the notional principal for the interest payments declines during the life of the swap, perhaps at a rate tied to the prepayment of a mortgage or to an interest rate benchmark such as the LIBOR. It is suitable to those customers of banks who want to manage the interest rate risk involved in predicted funding requirement, or investment programs.<ref name=\"Fabozzi\"/>\n* A '''zero coupon swap''' is of use to those entities which have their liabilities denominated in floating rates but at the same time would like to conserve cash for operational purposes.\n* A '''deferred rate swap''' is particularly attractive to those users of funds that need funds immediately but do not consider the current rates of interest very attractive and feel that the rates may fall in future.\n* An '''accreting swap''' is used by banks which have agreed to lend increasing sums over time to its customers so that they may fund projects.\n* A '''forward swap''' is an agreement created through the synthesis of two swaps differing in duration for the purpose of fulfilling the specific time-frame needs of an investor. Also referred to as a forward start swap, delayed start swap, and a deferred start swap.\n* A '''[[Quanto|quanto swap]]''' is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap in which one counterparty pays a foreign interest rate to the other, but the notional amount is in domestic currency. The second party may be paying a fixed or floating rate. For example, a swap in which the notional amount is denominated in Canadian dollars, but where the floating rate is set as USD LIBOR, would be considered a quanto swap.  Quanto swaps are known as ''differential'' or ''rate-differential'' or ''diff'' swaps.\n* A '''range accrual swap''' (or '''range accrual note''') is an agreement to pay a fixed or floating rate while receiving cash flows from a fixed or floating rate which are accrued only on those days where the second rate falls within a preagreed range.  The received payments are maximized when the second rate stays entirely within the range for the duration of the swap.\n* A '''three-zone digital''' swap is a generalization of the range accrual swap, the payer of a fixed rate receives a floating rate if that rate stays within a certain preagreed range, or a fixed rate if the floating rate goes above the range, or a different fixed rate if the floating rate falls below the range.\n\n==Valuation and Pricing==\n{{main|Rational pricing#Swaps|Arbitrage}}\n{{further|Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing||Asset swap#Computing the asset swap spread|Credit default swap#Pricing and valuation|Currency swap#Valuation and Pricing|Variance swap#Pricing and valuation}}\n\nThe value of a swap is the [[net present value]] (NPV) of all ''expected'' future cash flows, essentially the difference in leg values. \nA swap is thus \"worth zero\" when it is first initiated, otherwise one party would be at an advantage, and arbitrage would be possible; \nhowever after this time its value may become positive or negative.<ref name=\"hull\"/> \n\nWhile this principle holds true for any swap, the following discussion is for plain vanilla interest rate swaps and is representative of pure rational pricing as it excludes [[credit risk]]. \nFor interest rate swaps, there are in fact two methods, which will (must) return the same value: \nin terms of [[Bond (finance)|bond]] prices, or as a portfolio of [[forward contract]]s.<ref name=\"hull\"/>\nThe fact that these methods agree, underscores the fact that rational pricing will apply ''between'' instruments also.\n<!-- In practice\u2014especially since the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]]\u2014swaps are priced using a \"multi-curve\" framework; see [[Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing]] for formulae, and [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing]] for context. --> \n===Arbitrage arguments===\nAs mentioned, to be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the NPV of these future cash flows is equal to zero. Where this is not the case, arbitrage would be possible.\n\nFor example, consider a plain vanilla fixed-to-floating interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate, and Party B pays a floating rate. In such an agreement the ''fixed rate'' would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A are equal to the present value of the ''expected'' future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Where this is not the case, an [[Arbitrage]]ur, C, could:\n# assume the position with the ''lower'' present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value\n# meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments - which have a higher present value\n# use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds\n# pocket the difference - where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit.\n\nSubsequently, once traded, the price of the Swap must equate to the price of the various corresponding instruments as mentioned above. Where this is not true, an arbitrageur could similarly [[short (finance)|short sell]] the overpriced instrument, and use the proceeds to purchase the correctly priced instrument, pocket the difference, and then use payments generated to service the instrument which he is short.\n===Using bond prices===\nWhile principal payments are not exchanged in an interest rate swap, assuming that these are received and paid at the end of the swap does not change its value. Thus, from the point of view of the floating-rate payer, a swap is equivalent to a long position in a [[fixed-rate bond]] (i.e. ''receiving'' fixed interest payments), and a short position in a [[floating rate note]] (i.e. ''making'' floating interest payments):\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{fixed} - B_\\mathrm{floating} \\, </math>\n\nFrom the point of view of the fixed-rate payer, the swap can be viewed as having the opposite positions. That is,\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{swap} = B_\\mathrm{floating} - B_\\mathrm{fixed} \\, </math>\n\nSimilarly, currency swaps can be regarded as having positions in bonds whose cash flows correspond to those in the swap.

The six primary aspects of an AFDX data network include [[full duplex]], redundancy, determinism, high speed performance, [[Fully_switched_network|switched]] and profiled network.\n\n==History==\nMany commercial aircraft use the [[ARINC 429]] standard developed in 1977 for safety-critical applications. ARINC 429 utilizes a unidirectional bus with a single transmitter and up to twenty receivers. A data word consists of 32 bits communicated over a twisted pair cable using the bipolar return-to-zero modulation. There are two speeds of transmission: high speed operates at 100 kbit/s and low speed operates at 12.5 kbit/s. ARINC 429 operates in such a way that its single transmitter communicates in a point-to-point connection, thus requiring a significant amount of wiring which amounts to added weight.\n\nAnother standard, [[ARINC 629]], introduced by Boeing for the [[Boeing 777|777]] provided increased data speeds of up to 2 Mbit/s and allowing a maximum of 120 data terminals. This ADN operates without the use of a bus controller thereby increasing the reliability of the network architecture. The drawback is that it requires custom hardware which can add significant cost to the aircraft. Because of this, other manufacturers did not openly accept the ARINC 629 standard.\n\nAFDX was designed as the next-generation aircraft data network.

Through the use of twisted pair or fiber optic cables, full-duplex Ethernet uses two separate pairs or strands for transmitting and receiving the data. AFDX extends standard Ethernet to provide high data integrity and deterministic timing. Further a redundant pair of networks is used to improve the system integrity (although a virtual link may be configured to use one or the other network only). It specifies interoperable functional elements at the following [[OSI model|OSI reference model]] layers:\n\n* [[Data link layer|Data link]] ([[Media Access Control|MAC]] and virtual link addressing concept);\n* [[Network Layer|Network]] ([[Internet Protocol|IP]] and [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]]);\n* [[Transport Layer|Transport]] ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] and optionally [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]])\n* [[Application layer|Application (network)]] (sampling, queuing, [[Service Access Point|SAP]], [[TFTP]] and [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]]).\n\nThe main elements of an AFDX network are:\n* AFDX end systems\n* AFDX switches\n* AFDX links\n\n==Virtual links==\nThe central feature of an AFDX network are its ''virtual links'' (VL). In one abstraction, it is possible to visualise the VLs as an [[ARINC 429]] style network each with one source and one or more destinations. Virtual links are unidirectional logic paths from the source end-system to all of the destination end-systems. Unlike that of a traditional Ethernet switch which switches frames based on the Ethernet destination or MAC address, AFDX routes packets using a virtual link ID, which is carried in the same position in an AFDX frame as the MAC destination address in an Ethernet frame. However, in the case of AFDX, this virtual link ID identifies the data carried rather than the physical destination. The virtual link ID is a 16-bit [[Unsigned integers|unsigned integer]] value that follows a constant 32-bit field. The switches are designed to route an incoming frame from one, and only one, end system to a predetermined set of end systems. There can be one or more receiving end systems connected within each virtual link. Each virtual link is allocated dedicated bandwidth [sum of all VL bandwidth allocation gap (BAG) rates x [[Maximum Transmission Unit|MTU]]] with the total amount of bandwidth defined by the system integrator. However, total bandwidth cannot exceed the maximum available bandwidth on the network. Bi-directional communications must therefore require the specification of a complementary VL.\n\nEach VL is frozen in specification to ensure that the network has a designed maximum traffic, hence determinism. Also the switch, having a VL configuration table loaded, can reject any erroneous data transmission that may otherwise swamp other branches of the network. Additionally, there can be sub-virtual links (sub-VLs) that are designed to carry less critical data. Sub-virtual links are assigned to a particular virtual link. Data are read in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] sequence among the virtual links with data to transmit. Also sub-virtual links do not provide guaranteed bandwidth or latency due to the buffering, but AFDX specifies that latency is measured from the traffic regulator function anyway.\n\n==BAG rate==\nBAG stands for bandwidth allocation gap, this is one of the main features of the AFDX protocol. This is the maximum rate data can be sent, and it is guaranteed to be sent at that interval.  When setting the BAG rate for each VL, care must be taken so there will be enough bandwidth for other VL's and the total speed cannot exceed 100 Mbit/s.\n\n==Switching of virtual links==\nEach switch has filtering, policing, and forwarding functions that should be able to process at least 4096 VLs. Therefore, in a network with multiple switches (cascaded star topology), the total number of virtual links is nearly limitless. There is no specified limit to the number of virtual links that can be handled by each end system, although this will be determined by the BAG rates and maximum frame size specified for each VL versus the Ethernet data rate. However, the number sub-VLs that may be created in a single virtual link is limited to four. The switch must also be non-blocking at the data rates that are specified by the system integrator, and in practice this may mean that the switch shall have a switching capacity that is the sum of all of its physical ports.\n\nSince AFDX utilizes the Ethernet protocol at the MAC layer, it is possible to use high performance COTS switches with Layer 2 routing as AFDX switches for testing purposes as a cost-cutting measure. However, some features of a real AFDX switch may be missing, such as traffic policing and redundancy functions.\n\n==Usage==\nThe AFDX bus is used in [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787]], [[Airbus A400M]], [[Airbus A350]], [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], [[ATR 42]], [[ATR 72]] (-600), [[AgustaWestland AW101]], [[AgustaWestland AW189]], [[AgustaWestland AW169]], [[Irkut MC-21]], [[Bombardier Global Express]], [[Bombardier CSeries]], [[Learjet 85]], [[Comac ARJ21]],<ref name=\"AFDXwebsite\">{{cite web\n    | url=http://www.afdx.com\n    | title=AFDX technology to improve communications on Boeing 787\n    | publisher=AFDX Products\n    | accessdate=2012-01-13\n    | quote=''AFDX data communications are used on the Airbus A380/A350/A400M, Boeing B787 Dreamliner (ARINC664), ARJ21 and Super jet 100.''\n}}</ref> and [[AgustaWestland AW149]].<ref name=\"AINonline\">{{cite web\n    | url=http://www.ainonline.com/?q=aviation-news/paris-air-show/2011-06-20/paris-2011-agustawestland-asserts-its-independence-cockpit\n    | title=Paris 2011: AgustaWestland asserts its independence in the cockpit\n    | publisher=Aviation International News (AINonline)\n    | accessdate=2012-01-13\n    | quote=''The architecture adopted by AgustaWestland is centered around the AFDX data network developed for the latest commercial airliners.

When setting the BAG rate for each VL, care must be taken so there will be enough bandwidth for other VL's and the total speed cannot exceed 100 Mbit/s.\n\n==Switching of virtual links==\nEach switch has filtering, policing, and forwarding functions that should be able to process at least 4096 VLs. Therefore, in a network with multiple switches (cascaded star topology), the total number of virtual links is nearly limitless. There is no specified limit to the number of virtual links that can be handled by each end system, although this will be determined by the BAG rates and maximum frame size specified for each VL versus the Ethernet data rate. However, the number sub-VLs that may be created in a single virtual link is limited to four. The switch must also be non-blocking at the data rates that are specified by the system integrator, and in practice this may mean that the switch shall have a switching capacity that is the sum of all of its physical ports.\n\nSince AFDX utilizes the Ethernet protocol at the MAC layer, it is possible to use high performance COTS switches with Layer 2 routing as AFDX switches for testing purposes as a cost-cutting measure. However, some features of a real AFDX switch may be missing, such as traffic policing and redundancy functions.\n\n==Usage==\nThe AFDX bus is used in [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787]], [[Airbus A400M]], [[Airbus A350]], [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], [[ATR 42]], [[ATR 72]] (-600), [[AgustaWestland AW101]], [[AgustaWestland AW189]], [[AgustaWestland AW169]], [[Irkut MC-21]], [[Bombardier Global Express]], [[Bombardier CSeries]], [[Learjet 85]], [[Comac ARJ21]],<ref name=\"AFDXwebsite\">{{cite web\n    | url=http://www.afdx.com\n    | title=AFDX technology to improve communications on Boeing 787\n    | publisher=AFDX Products\n    | accessdate=2012-01-13\n    | quote=''AFDX data communications are used on the Airbus A380/A350/A400M, Boeing B787 Dreamliner (ARINC664), ARJ21 and Super jet 100.''\n}}</ref> and [[AgustaWestland AW149]].<ref name=\"AINonline\">{{cite web\n    | url=http://www.ainonline.com/?q=aviation-news/paris-air-show/2011-06-20/paris-2011-agustawestland-asserts-its-independence-cockpit\n    | title=Paris 2011: AgustaWestland asserts its independence in the cockpit\n    | publisher=Aviation International News (AINonline)\n    | accessdate=2012-01-13\n    | quote=''The architecture adopted by AgustaWestland is centered around the AFDX data network developed for the latest commercial airliners.
