In all countries that use daylight saving, the clock is advanced in spring and set back in autumn; the spring change reduces the length of that day and the autumn change increases it. For a midnight shift in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 23:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0.

The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.\n\nThe period of daylight saving time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. For example, in the U.S. the period of daylight saving time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for daylight saving time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.\n\nDST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Aries\" /> (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/|title=MIT Wristband Could Make AC Obsolete|last=Vanhemert|first=Kyle|date=October 30, 2013|work=Wired|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>)  Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning.

[...] The rise of ''daylight savings time'' appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when ''saving'' is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether ''saving'' is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving).

American English replaces ''standard'' with ''daylight'': for example, ''[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]]'' (''PST'') becomes ''Pacific Daylight Time'' (''PDT''). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is ''[[British Summer Time]]'' (BST), and British English typically inserts ''summer'' into other time zone names, e.g. ''[[Central European Time]]'' (''CET'') becomes ''[[Central European Summer Time]]'' (''CEST'').\n\nThe North American English mnemonic \"spring forward, fall back\" (also \"spring ahead&nbsp;...\", \"spring up&nbsp;...\", and \"...&nbsp;fall behind\") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.<ref name=\"Downing-Prerau\" />\n\n==Computing==\n[[File:Daylightsavings.svg|thumb|upright|\nalt=Strong man in sandals and with shaggy hair, facing away from audience/artist, grabbing a hand of a clock bigger than he is and attempting to force it backwards.

In Unix-like systems the TZ [[environment variable]] specifies the [[List of tz zones by name|location name]], as in <code>TZ=':America/New_York'</code>. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the {{kbd|/etc/localtime}} file, which is usually a [[symbolic link]] or [[hard link]] to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent [[Unix time]]; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\n\nOlder or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by [[POSIX]], which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, <code>TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00'</code> specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007.

This causes several problems, including compatibility when [[multi boot]]ing with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a [[Windows registry]] entry <var>RealTimeIsUniversal</var> that had been introduced many years earlier, when [[Windows NT]] supported [[RISC]] machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.<ref name=RealTimeIsUniversal>{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/mswish/ut-rtc.html |title=IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT |publisher=Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge |author=Markus Kuhn |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.<ref name=KB2922223>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2922223 |title=You cannot change system time if RealTimeIsUniversal registry entry is enabled in Windows |author=Microsoft }}</ref><ref name=KB2800213>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2800213 |title=High CPU usage during DST changeover in Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2 |author=Microsoft }}</ref>\n\nThe [[NTFS]] file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local\u2014or seasonal\u2014time. However, the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some [[file archiver]]s. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a [[checksum algorithm]]).  A ready clue is if the time stamps differ by precisely 1 hour.\n\n==Permanent daylight saving time==\n{{see also|Permanent daylight saving time in the United States|Decree time|Summer time in Europe#Future|label2=Decree time in Russia}}\n[[File:Willett memorial.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A standing stone in a grassy field surrounded by trees.

Late sunrise times can become unpopular in the winter months which essentially forces workers and schoolchildren to begin the day in darkness. In 1974 following the enactment of the Emergency Daylight Saving Time Act in the [[United States]], complaints of children going to school in the dark and working people commuting and starting their work day in pitch darkness during the winter months led to the repeal of the act in October 1974 when standard time was restored until February 23, 1975. In 1976, the United States returned to the schedule set under the [[Uniform Time Act of 1966]]. In 1971, year-round daylight time in the [[United Kingdom]] was abandoned after a 3-year experiment because of complaints about winter sunrise times.

Britain, most of its [[Allies of World War I|allies]], and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned DST in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, Ireland, and the United States. It became common during [[World War II]], and was widely adopted in America and Europe from the 1970s as a result of the [[1970s energy crisis]].

In all countries that use daylight saving, the clock is advanced in spring and set back in autumn; the spring change reduces the length of that day and the autumn change increases it. For a midnight shift in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 23:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0. For the same clock in autumn, the local time would appear to repeat the hour preceding midnight, i.e. jumping from 23:59:59.9 to 23:00:00.0.\n\nIn most countries that use daylight saving time, the time applied in the winter is considered as \"standard\" time and the shift is considered to be a positive offset. The opposite is also possible, with Ireland, for example, defining its summer time to be the legal standard and [[Winter time (clock lag)|winter time]] to be a negative offset.<ref>{{cite web |title=Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1971/act/17/section/1/enacted/en/html |website=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB) |language=en}}</ref> Morocco sets its clocks back one hour during the month of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]] relative to its standard time.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kasraoui |first1=Safaa |title=Morocco to Switch Clocks Back 1 Hour on May 5 for Ramadan |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2019/04/270773/morocco-gmt-dst-ramadan/ |work=Morocco World News |date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe time at which to change clocks differs across jurisdictions. Members of the [[European Union]] conduct a coordinated shift, shifting all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 [[Central European Time]] (CET), equivalent to 03:00 [[Eastern European Time]] (EET); as a result, the time differences across European time zones remain constant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/at-what-time-should-clocks-go-forward-or-back-for-summer-time-faq-time|last= National Physical Laboratory|title= At what time should clocks go forward or back for summer time (FAQ \u2013 Time)|date= March 31, 2016|accessdate= October 17, 2016|quote= The time at which summer time begins and ends is given in the relevant EU Directive and UK Statutory Instrument as 1&nbsp;am.

For example, Central European Time is usually six hours ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone|North American Eastern Time]], except for a few weeks in March and October/November, while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours for a few weeks per year.

The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.\n\nThe period of daylight saving time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. For example, in the U.S. the period of daylight saving time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for daylight saving time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.\n\nDST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Aries\" /> (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/|title=MIT Wristband Could Make AC Obsolete|last=Vanhemert|first=Kyle|date=October 30, 2013|work=Wired|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>)  Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of [[incandescent lighting]], once a primary use of electricity.<ref name=\"Bartlett\">{{cite book |author=Roscoe G.

[...] The rise of ''daylight savings time'' appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when ''saving'' is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether ''saving'' is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving).

American English replaces ''standard'' with ''daylight'': for example, ''[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]]'' (''PST'') becomes ''Pacific Daylight Time'' (''PDT''). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is ''[[British Summer Time]]'' (BST), and British English typically inserts ''summer'' into other time zone names, e.g. ''[[Central European Time]]'' (''CET'') becomes ''[[Central European Summer Time]]'' (''CEST'').\n\nThe North American English mnemonic \"spring forward, fall back\" (also \"spring ahead&nbsp;...\", \"spring up&nbsp;...\", and \"...&nbsp;fall behind\") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.<ref name=\"Downing-Prerau\" />\n\n==Computing==\n[[File:Daylightsavings.svg|thumb|upright|\nalt=Strong man in sandals and with shaggy hair, facing away from audience/artist, grabbing a hand of a clock bigger than he is and attempting to force it backwards.

In Unix-like systems the TZ [[environment variable]] specifies the [[List of tz zones by name|location name]], as in <code>TZ=':America/New_York'</code>. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the {{kbd|/etc/localtime}} file, which is usually a [[symbolic link]] or [[hard link]] to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent [[Unix time]]; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\n\nOlder or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by [[POSIX]], which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, <code>TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00'</code> specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.unix.org/version3/ |publisher=The Open Group |title=IEEE Std 1003.1\u20132004 |year=2004 |chapterurl=http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html#tag_08_03 |chapter=Other environment variables }}</ref>\n\n===Microsoft Windows===\n{{Update section|date=February 2020|reason=information about more recent versions of Windows would be useful}} \nAs with zoneinfo, a user of [[Microsoft Windows]] configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change.

For example, before 2005, DST in [[Israel]] varied each year and was skipped some years. [[Windows 95]] used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In [[Windows 98]], Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 [[Israeli Daylight Saving Law]] established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way.

This causes several problems, including compatibility when [[multi boot]]ing with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a [[Windows registry]] entry <var>RealTimeIsUniversal</var> that had been introduced many years earlier, when [[Windows NT]] supported [[RISC]] machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.<ref name=RealTimeIsUniversal>{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/mswish/ut-rtc.html |title=IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT |publisher=Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge |author=Markus Kuhn |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.<ref name=KB2922223>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2922223 |title=You cannot change system time if RealTimeIsUniversal registry entry is enabled in Windows |author=Microsoft }}</ref><ref name=KB2800213>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2800213 |title=High CPU usage during DST changeover in Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2 |author=Microsoft }}</ref>\n\nThe [[NTFS]] file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local\u2014or seasonal\u2014time. However, the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some [[file archiver]]s. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a [[checksum algorithm]]).

He begins his investigation at Toretto's Market, ordering his regular tuna on white, no crust, and flirting with its owner Mia, sister of infamous street racer [[Dominic Toretto]], while Dominic ostensibly sits in the back office reading a newspaper. Dominic's crew, Vince, Leon, Jesse, and his girlfriend Letty, arrives. Vince, who has a crush on Mia, starts a fight with Brian until Dominic intervenes.\n\nThat night, Brian brings a modified [[Mitsubishi Eclipse#Second generation (2G, 1995\u20131999)|1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse]] to an illegal street race, hoping to find a lead on the heist crew. Dominic arrives in his [[Mazda RX-7#FD|Mazda RX-7]] and initiates a drag race between himself, Brian and two other drivers. Lacking funds, Brian is forced to wager his car. Dominic wins the race after Brian's car malfunctions, but the LAPD arrive before he can hand over his vehicle. Brian, in his car, helps Dominic escape, but they accidentally venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader Johnny Tran and his cousin Lance Nguyen, who destroy Brian's vehicle. Later, Dominic reiterates that Brian still owes him a \"10 second car\".  The two then walk back to Dominic's house together, where an altercation between Vince, who is upset that Brian is at the house, and Dominic breaks out.\n\nBrian brings a damaged [[Toyota Supra#A80|1994 Toyota Supra]] to Dominic's garage as a replacement. Dominic and his crew begin the long process of restoring the vehicle, and Brian starts dating Mia. He also begins investigating Tran, convinced that he is the mastermind behind the truck hijackings. While investigating one garage at night, Brian is discovered by Dominic and Vince who demand an explanation. Brian convinces them that he is researching his opponents vehicles for the upcoming desert [[Race Wars (The Fast and the Furious)|Race Wars]]. Together, the trio investigate Tran's garage, discovering a large quantity of electronic goods.\n\nBrian reports the discovery to his superiors and Tran and Lance are arrested. The raid fails however when the electronics are proved to have been purchased legally. Brian is forced to confront his suspicion that Dominic is the true mastermind. Brian is given 36 hours to find the heist crew, as the truckers are now arming themselves to defend against the hijackings. The following day, Dominic and Brian attend Race Wars. There, Jesse wagers his father's [[Volkswagen Jetta#Mk3|Volkswagen Jetta]] against Tran in his [[Honda S2000]], but flees with the car after he loses. Tran demands Dominic recover the vehicle, and accuses him of reporting him to the police. Enraged, Dominic beats up Tran.\n\nLater that night, Brian witnesses Dominic and his crew leaving and realizes that they are the hijackers. He reveals his true identity to Mia and convinces her to help him find the crew. Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon attack a semi-trailer truck, intending it to be their final heist. The armed driver shoots Vince and runs Letty off the road. Brian arrives with Mia and rescues Vince. He is forced to reveal his identity to call in emergency medical care to save him. Dominic, Mia and the rest of the crew leave before the authorities can arrive.\n\nSome time later, Brian arrives at Dominic's house to apprehend him as he is reversing his father's [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1970|1970 Dodge Charger R/T]] out of the garage. Jesse arrives, pleading for protection. Tran and Lance ride by on motorbikes and shoot Jesse for reneging on their bet. Brian and Dominic give chase in their separate vehicles, finding and killing Tran and injuring Lance. Brian then pursues Dominic, with them both eventually acquiescing to a quarter-mile drag race. The pair barely cross a railroad before a train passes, which ends the race in a draw, but Dominic crashes his car into a truck. Instead of arresting him, Brian gives the keys to his own car to Dominic, asserting that he still owes him a 10 second car. Dominic escapes in the Supra as Brian walks away.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving through [[Baja California]] [[Mexico]], in a 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | align  = right\n   | footer = [[Paul Walker]] (''left'') in 2009, [[Vin Diesel]] in 2013, and [[Michelle Rodriguez]] in 2018\n   | image1 = PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg\n   | width1 = 147\n   | image2 = Vin Diesel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n   | width2 = 175\n   | image3 = Michelle Rodriguez Cannes 2018 cropped.jpg\n   | width3 = 151\n   | alt = \n}}\n{{Details|List of Fast & Furious characters}} \n* [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]]:                         An LAPD officer sent to infiltrate a crew of hijackers.

Moritz]], who had previously worked with [[Paul Walker]] on the film ''[[The Skulls (film)|The Skulls]]'' (2000), gave the actor a script and offered him the role of Brian O'Conner.  Originally, the studio told the producers they would [[green-light]] the film if they could get [[Timothy Olyphant]] to play the role of Dominic Toretto. Olyphant, however, who had starred in the previous year's car-themed blockbuster ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', declined the role. Moritz instead suggested Diesel, who had to be convinced to take the role even though he had only played supporting roles up to that point.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot in various locations within [[Los Angeles]] and parts of southern [[California]], from July to October 2000. Key locations included [[Dodger Stadium]] (on the opening scene where Brian tests his Eclipse on the parking lot), [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles, California|Angelino Heights]], [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] and [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]] (the neighborhoods around Toretto's home), as well as [[Little Saigon, Orange County|Little Saigon]] (where Tran destroys the Eclipse) and the [[San Bernardino International Airport]] (the venue for ''Race Wars'', which attracted over 1,500 import car owners and enthusiasts).<ref name=\"Cinema.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/594/fast-and-the-furious-the-production-notes.phtml|title=Fast and the Furious, The : Production Notes|website=www.cinema.com|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The entire last rig heist scene was filmed along Domenigoni Parkway on the southern side of [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]]/[[Hemet, California|Hemet]] in the [[San Jacinto Valley]] near [[Diamond Valley Lake]].\n\nPrior to filming, both [[Jordana Brewster]] and [[Michelle Rodriguez]] did not have driver's licenses, so they took driving lessons during production. For the climactic race scene between Brian and Toretto, separate shots of both cars crossing the railroad and the train crossing the street were filmed, then composited together to give the illusion of the train narrowly missing the cars. A long steel rod was used as a ramp for Toretto's car to crash through the semi-truck and fly in mid-air.\n\nAn alternate ending titled \"More than Furious\" was filmed, in which Tanner drops Brian off at the Toretto home, where he encounters Mia packing, intending to move away. Brian reveals that he resigned from the LAPD, who let him go quietly, and that he wants another chance with her. When Mia tells him that it's not going to be that simple, Brian tells her that he's got time. This ending was released in the collection bundle DVD version.\n\nDuring the filming of the movie, seventy-eight cars were wrecked both on and off-screen.  Out of the seventy-eight cars, three cars were shown being destroyed in the film's trailer alone.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Jamie |title=How many cars has the Fast and Furious franchise destroyed? |url=https://www.confused.com/car-insurance/how-many-cars-has-fast-furious-wrecked |website=Confused.com |publisher=Confused.com |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|The Fast and the Furious (soundtrack)|More Fast and Furious}}\nThe film's score was composed by music producer [[BT (musician)|BT]], mixing [[electronica]] with [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Industrial music|industrial]] influences.

He begins his investigation at Toretto's Market, ordering his regular tuna on white, no crust, and flirting with its owner Mia, sister of infamous street racer [[Dominic Toretto]], while Dominic ostensibly sits in the back office reading a newspaper. Dominic's crew, Vince, Leon, Jesse, and his girlfriend Letty, arrives. Vince, who has a crush on Mia, starts a fight with Brian until Dominic intervenes.\n\nThat night, Brian brings a modified [[Mitsubishi Eclipse#Second generation (2G, 1995\u20131999)|1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse]] to an illegal street race, hoping to find a lead on the heist crew. Dominic arrives in his [[Mazda RX-7#FD|Mazda RX-7]] and initiates a drag race between himself, Brian and two other drivers. Lacking funds, Brian is forced to wager his car. Dominic wins the race after Brian's car malfunctions, but the LAPD arrive before he can hand over his vehicle. Brian, in his car, helps Dominic escape, but they accidentally venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader Johnny Tran and his cousin Lance Nguyen, who destroy Brian's vehicle. Later, Dominic reiterates that Brian still owes him a \"10 second car\".  The two then walk back to Dominic's house together, where an altercation between Vince, who is upset that Brian is at the house, and Dominic breaks out.\n\nBrian brings a damaged [[Toyota Supra#A80|1994 Toyota Supra]] to Dominic's garage as a replacement. Dominic and his crew begin the long process of restoring the vehicle, and Brian starts dating Mia. He also begins investigating Tran, convinced that he is the mastermind behind the truck hijackings. While investigating one garage at night, Brian is discovered by Dominic and Vince who demand an explanation. Brian convinces them that he is researching his opponents vehicles for the upcoming desert [[Race Wars (The Fast and the Furious)|Race Wars]]. Together, the trio investigate Tran's garage, discovering a large quantity of electronic goods.\n\nBrian reports the discovery to his superiors and Tran and Lance are arrested. The raid fails however when the electronics are proved to have been purchased legally. Brian is forced to confront his suspicion that Dominic is the true mastermind. Brian is given 36 hours to find the heist crew, as the truckers are now arming themselves to defend against the hijackings. The following day, Dominic and Brian attend Race Wars. There, Jesse wagers his father's [[Volkswagen Jetta#Mk3|Volkswagen Jetta]] against Tran in his [[Honda S2000]], but flees with the car after he loses. Tran demands Dominic recover the vehicle, and accuses him of reporting him to the police. Enraged, Dominic beats up Tran.\n\nLater that night, Brian witnesses Dominic and his crew leaving and realizes that they are the hijackers. He reveals his true identity to Mia and convinces her to help him find the crew. Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon attack a semi-trailer truck, intending it to be their final heist. The armed driver shoots Vince and runs Letty off the road. Brian arrives with Mia and rescues Vince. He is forced to reveal his identity to call in emergency medical care to save him. Dominic, Mia and the rest of the crew leave before the authorities can arrive.\n\nSome time later, Brian arrives at Dominic's house to apprehend him as he is reversing his father's [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1970|1970 Dodge Charger R/T]] out of the garage. Jesse arrives, pleading for protection. Tran and Lance ride by on motorbikes and shoot Jesse for reneging on their bet. Brian and Dominic give chase in their separate vehicles, finding and killing Tran and injuring Lance. Brian then pursues Dominic, with them both eventually acquiescing to a quarter-mile drag race. The pair barely cross a railroad before a train passes, which ends the race in a draw, but Dominic crashes his car into a truck. Instead of arresting him, Brian gives the keys to his own car to Dominic, asserting that he still owes him a 10 second car. Dominic escapes in the Supra as Brian walks away.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving through [[Baja California]] [[Mexico]], in a 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | align  = right\n   | footer = [[Paul Walker]] (''left'') in 2009, [[Vin Diesel]] in 2013, and [[Michelle Rodriguez]] in 2018\n   | image1 = PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg\n   | width1 = 147\n   | image2 = Vin Diesel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n   | width2 = 175\n   | image3 = Michelle Rodriguez Cannes 2018 cropped.jpg\n   | width3 = 151\n   | alt = \n}}\n{{Details|List of Fast & Furious characters}} \n* [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]]:                         An LAPD officer sent to infiltrate a crew of hijackers.

Moritz]], who had previously worked with [[Paul Walker]] on the film ''[[The Skulls (film)|The Skulls]]'' (2000), gave the actor a script and offered him the role of Brian O'Conner.  Originally, the studio told the producers they would [[green-light]] the film if they could get [[Timothy Olyphant]] to play the role of Dominic Toretto. Olyphant, however, who had starred in the previous year's car-themed blockbuster ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', declined the role. Moritz instead suggested Diesel, who had to be convinced to take the role even though he had only played supporting roles up to that point.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot in various locations within [[Los Angeles]] and parts of southern [[California]], from July to October 2000. Key locations included [[Dodger Stadium]] (on the opening scene where Brian tests his Eclipse on the parking lot), [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles, California|Angelino Heights]], [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] and [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]] (the neighborhoods around Toretto's home), as well as [[Little Saigon, Orange County|Little Saigon]] (where Tran destroys the Eclipse) and the [[San Bernardino International Airport]] (the venue for ''Race Wars'', which attracted over 1,500 import car owners and enthusiasts).<ref name=\"Cinema.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/594/fast-and-the-furious-the-production-notes.phtml|title=Fast and the Furious, The : Production Notes|website=www.cinema.com|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The entire last rig heist scene was filmed along Domenigoni Parkway on the southern side of [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]]/[[Hemet, California|Hemet]] in the [[San Jacinto Valley]] near [[Diamond Valley Lake]].\n\nPrior to filming, both [[Jordana Brewster]] and [[Michelle Rodriguez]] did not have driver's licenses, so they took driving lessons during production. For the climactic race scene between Brian and Toretto, separate shots of both cars crossing the railroad and the train crossing the street were filmed, then composited together to give the illusion of the train narrowly missing the cars. A long steel rod was used as a ramp for Toretto's car to crash through the semi-truck and fly in mid-air.\n\nAn alternate ending titled \"More than Furious\" was filmed, in which Tanner drops Brian off at the Toretto home, where he encounters Mia packing, intending to move away. Brian reveals that he resigned from the LAPD, who let him go quietly, and that he wants another chance with her. When Mia tells him that it's not going to be that simple, Brian tells her that he's got time. This ending was released in the collection bundle DVD version.\n\nDuring the filming of the movie, seventy-eight cars were wrecked both on and off-screen.  Out of the seventy-eight cars, three cars were shown being destroyed in the film's trailer alone.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Jamie |title=How many cars has the Fast and Furious franchise destroyed? |url=https://www.confused.com/car-insurance/how-many-cars-has-fast-furious-wrecked |website=Confused.com |publisher=Confused.com |accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|The Fast and the Furious (soundtrack)|More Fast and Furious}}\nThe film's score was composed by music producer [[BT (musician)|BT]], mixing [[electronica]] with [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Industrial music|industrial]] influences.

The small, thin shell has a lengthened oval shape. It is shining, yellowish-green, ornamented with white triangular spots with dark apices, sometimes in series. The shell is decussated by incremental and deeper spiral striae. The shell contains three [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s and a nearly terminal apex. The narrow [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is oval, its ventral face nearly level. Inside it is shining and greenish. The shell is very delicate and slender, allied to ''Stomatella planulata'', a much larger species, and ''Stomatella auricula'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/manualconch12tryorich H.A.

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]]. It means that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[Judge|judge]]s, [[arbitrator]]s, [[administrative law judge]]s, [[commission]]s{{efn-ua|Defined broadly to include [[government agency]], [[regulatory agency]] or [[statutory authority]] that operates under the authority of a board of commissioners, including [[Independent agencies of the United States government]].}} or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. Individual cases may be impacted by judicial hesitancy to make a decision. When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls final [[Adjudication|adjudication]] or resolution of a [[Motion (legal)|motion]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n== Origin ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

For myself, I am resolved that my decree shall come speedily, if not instantly, after the hearing, and my signed decree speedily upon my decree pronounced. For it hath been a manner much used of late in my last lord's time, of whom I learn much to imitate, and some what to avoid; that upon the solemn and full hearing of a cause nothing is pronounced in court, but breviates are required to be made; which I do not dislike in itself in causes perplexed. ... And it was my father's ordinary word, 'You must give me time.' But yet I find when such breviates were taken, the cause was sometimes forgotten a term or two, and then set down for a new hearing, three or four terms after. And in the meantime the subject's pulse beats swift, though the chancery pace be slow. Of which kind of intermission I see no use, and therefore I will promise regularly to pronounce my decree within few days after my hearing; and to sign my decree at the least in the vacation after the pronouncing. For fresh justice is the sweetest. And to the end that there be no delay of justice, nor any other means-making or labouring, but the labouring of the counsel at the bar. ...

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.
