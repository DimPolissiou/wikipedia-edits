This program broadcasts on the hour, 24 hours a day.\n\n==History==\n''NHK Newsline'' started as ''Day Line Japan'' in April 1997, with a length of 10 minutes, and airing several times a day. In 2000, the program's name was changed to ''Newsline''. The English spoken portions of the program would gradually expand with time.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, ''[[News Watch 9]]'' - an English-dubbed news program - was removed from the NHK World line-up. On February 2, 2009, ''Newsline'' was re-formatted in order to fill the gap left by ''News Watch 9'', by changing to a news and information program. ''Newsline's'' time slot also changed to air at the top of every hour, 24 times a day. The length of the program was typically 30 minutes during the week, and 10 minutes on weekends and Japanese holidays. The program has been referred to as ''NHK Newsline'' since Late March 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/resources/brochure/pdf/guide_en.pdf|title=NHK World FY 2016 Press Kit|publisher=NHK World TV|access-date=5 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 2019, ''NHK Newsline'' changed to a 15-20 minute format on weekdays at most times, while other Newsline-branded programs fill the remaining time until the bottom of the hour. These include ''Newsline In Depth'', which features a variety of feature stories, and ''Newsline Biz'', with business news.
