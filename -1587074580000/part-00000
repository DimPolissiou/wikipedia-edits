It was directed by [[William Dieterle]] and produced by [[Buddy Adler]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[Harry Kleiner]] and  [[Jesse Lasky Jr.]] The music score was by [[George Duning]], the dance music by [[Daniele Amfitheatrof]] and the cinematography by [[Charles Lang]]. Rita Hayworth's costumes were designed by [[Jean Louis]]. Hayworth's dances for this film were choreographed by [[Valerie Bettis]]. This film was the last produced by Hayworth's production company, the Beckworth Corporation.\n\nThe film stars [[Rita Hayworth]] as [[Salome]], as well as [[Stewart Granger]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Judith Anderson]], with [[Cedric Hardwicke]], [[Alan Badel]] and [[Basil Sydney]].\n\n==Plot==\nAlthough based on the [[New Testament]] story, the film does not follow the Biblical text and is highly fictionalized.\nIn [[Galilee]], during the rule of Rome's [[Tiberius Caesar]] ([[Cedric Hardwicke]]), [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]] ([[Charles Laughton]]) and [[Herodias|Queen Herodias]] ([[Judith Anderson]]) sit on the throne and are condemned by a prophet known as [[John the Baptist]] ([[Alan Badel]]). Herodias resents John's denunciation of her marriage to the king, her former husband's brother, and the Baptist's claim that she is an adulteress. The king is not pleased with the Baptist condemning his rule, but fears a slow and agonizing death that his father, [[Herod the Great|the elder Herod]], suffered after ordering the [[Slaughter of Innocents|murder of firstborn males when Jesus was born]]. The prophecy states that if Herod kills the [[Messiah]], he will suffer and die. The king believes John the Baptist is the Messiah because of the mistaken belief of some peasants.\n\nAfter petitioning Caesar to marry Salome, Marcellus- nephew of Caesar- receives a message stating that he is forbidden to marry a \"barbarian.\" Salome is also sent a message that she is banished from Rome and will be escorted back to Galilee, despite having lived in Rome most of her life. When Marcellus does nothing to protest Caesar's decree, she declares that she shall never love another Roman.\n\nOn the boat escorting her home, Salome meets Claudius, a Roman soldier assigned to the palace of Herod. He is amused by her haughty behavior and thwarts her attempt to order him around when she demands to use drinking water instead of sea water for her bath aboard the ship. When he brings sea water instead, he interrupts her angry confrontation by stealing a long kiss, which earns him a slap across the face.\n\nQueen Herodias greets her daughter warmly when she arrives at the palace, and becomes aware of the lecherous intentions of the king, who marvels at Princess Salome's beauty. The queen sends Salome away and consults with her advisor, who agrees that the queen can use the king's desire for Salome for her own benefit. It is revealed that the queen is trapped in a loveless and potentially deadly marriage to the king because she wishes to preserve the throne for her daughter. Meanwhile, Salome sneaks into the marketplace with several servants to hear John the Baptist speak. She reveals her identity by speaking out and is spared from the angry crowd by John the Baptist, who calms them and denounces violence. Salome returns, upset by what she has heard, and later beguiles Claudius with romantic kisses in an attempt to have him arrest John the Baptist to spare her mother's potential death as an adulteress. She exits the room angrily after he refuses her request.\n\nShortly after, the king decides to arrest John the Baptist, ostensibly for treason but in reality to protect him from the actions of his wife. The trial ends with the king locking up John the Baptist. Salome hears that the prophet has been arrested; she thinks that Claudius did it for her, and apologizes to him for her behavior the night before. After she leaves, he learns that the king has imprisoned the Baptist and pleads for his release, but is unable to persuade the king. Claudius rushes off to Jerusalem on horseback to seek his release.\n\nThe king visits Salome, who bids Claudius farewell from the balcony, and is irritated that she pays him attention. Herod suggests after giving the princess a necklace that she \"find pleasure in the moment,\" which disgusts her, and she subsequently rejects his gift, reminding him that his queen is her mother.\nClaudius meets with Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem. Pilate refuses to release the Baptist because he preaches against Rome, then turns his attention to Claudius. He forbids Claudius from returning to Galilee, but does not arrest him because of their friendship. Outside, after the argument, Claudius hears about a miracle worker in Bethlehem and travels to see the prophet. He then returns to the palace, where Salome runs to greet him with a tearful embrace. She dreads dancing for the king to honor the queen's wishes for the Baptist's death, as it would mean surrendering her will to the king. Claudius leads Salome to John the Baptist's cell, where he tells the prisoner of the miracle worker in the presence of the princess. Salome is in love with the heroic [[ancient Rome|Roman]] soldier Claudius (Granger) who converts to [[Christianity]], and decides to help him.\n\nClaudius and Salome both rush off to try to save the Baptist's life. Claudius forcefully removes the Baptist from his cell and clashes with the palace guards; Salome dances a wild, enchanting dance and removes layers of clothing, thinking this will please the king, then she will ask him to set John free. But as she dances Herod tells Herodias that he will do anything for her because he likes the dance so much. Herodias asks him to kill John and John is beheaded before Salome finishes her dance. Horrified, she renounces her mother [[Herodias]], who planned and ordered the execution, and also becomes a Christian convert. The last scene shows Salome and Claudius listening to [[Christ]] (whose face is not shown) delivering the [[Sermon on the Mount]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rita Hayworth]] as Princess Salome\n* [[Stewart Granger]] as Commander Claudius\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as King Herod\n* [[Judith Anderson]] as Queen Herodias\n* [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]] as Tiberius Caesar\n* [[Alan Badel]] as John the Baptist\n* [[Basil Sydney]] as Pontius Pilate\n* [[Maurice Schwartz]] as Ezra the King's Advisor\n* [[Arnold Moss]] as Micha the Queen's Advisor\n* [[Asoka (dancer)|Asoka]] as Oriental Dancer\n* [[Sujata (dancer)|Sujata]] as Oriental Dancer\n\n==Production==\nThe original title of the film was ''Salome - Dance of the Seven Veils''.<ref>By THOMAS M PRYOR Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.

His 1951 paper describing the technique is the most-highly cited paper ever in the scientific literature, cited over 300,000 times.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Noorden |first1=R. |last2=Maher |first2=B. |last3=Nuzzo |first3=R. |year=2014 |title=The top 100 papers |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=514 |issue=7524 |pages=550\u2013553 |doi=10.1038/514550a|pmid=25355343 |bibcode=2014Natur.514..550V |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kresge |first1=N. |last2=Simoni |first2=R.

The Lowry method is based on the reaction of Cu<sup>+</sup>, produced by the oxidation of peptide bonds, with [[Folin\u2013Ciocalteu reagent]] (a mixture of [[phosphotungstic acid]] and [[phosphomolybdic acid]] in the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu reaction). The reaction mechanism is not well understood, but involves [[redox|reduction]] of the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu reagent and [[oxidation]] of [[aromatic]] residues (mainly [[tryptophan]], also [[tyrosine]]). Experiments have shown that [[cysteine]] is also reactive to the reagent. Therefore, cysteine residues in protein probably also contribute to the absorbance seen in the Lowry assay.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Everette |first1=J. D. |last2=Bryant |first2=Q.

Madea has stated that although her family didn't have much, they had love.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsi6IY4Jn3kC&pg=PT12&dq=Big+Mabel+Murphy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y3bsUPLABejy2QWrnoGgAg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ |title=Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings: Madea's Uninhibited ... - Tyler Perry - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>\nShe even claimed that her daddy would go outside and hunt for dogs and cook them on the stove to eat for dinner.\nAccording to ''Family Reunion'', Madea's mother, \"Big Mabel\" Murphy, was a [[Prostitute|hooker]] during Madea's childhood and was not at all religious. As a result, Madea grew up with little knowledge of [[Baptism]] (as an elderly woman, Madea has a tendency to misquote the [[Bible]]).\n\nShe attended Booker T. Washington High School, where she served as a cheerleader. When Madea was 16, her parents moved her and the rest of her immediate family to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in a barn house. It was reported in Madea's book, ''[[Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings]]'', that Madea's mother and father wouldn't allow her to go out at all until she turned 18.\n\nIn the films, it has been revealed that Madea used to be a stripper, and her stage names were Platinum and Delicious. It is heavily implied that she was a hooker as well.\n\n==Criminal background==\nMadea has a lifelong [[criminal record]] that began at age 9 with a charge of  [[theft]]. It is also reported that Madea was charged with her first felony at this age, and her crimes began progressing to [[illegal gambling]] at age 18, which later evolved into [[Cheque fraud|check fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[insurance fraud]] (presumably related to her nine deceased husbands), [[assault]], [[attempted murder]], vehicle theft (mostly Lexus vehicles, the first vehicle she ever stole being a 1992 [[Lexus LS400]]), [[reckless driving]] (including smashing through objects, notably a mansion gate, a [[Cadillac CTS]], and a fast food window in ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'', ''Goes to Jail'', and ''Big Happy Family'' respectively) and forklifting vehicles out of parking spaces (usually for taking spaces that she wants to park at, as she did to many [[Toyota Camry|Camrys]] and [[Scion (automobile)|Scions]], as well as a [[Pontiac Solstice]] that she ruined in ''Madea Goes to Jail''). Throughout the series, she is a repeat offender.\n\nIn ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' alone, Madea and her granddaughter Helen McCarter were both charged with \"criminal [[trespass]]ing, reckless [[endangerment]], criminal possession of a [[handgun]], assault with a deadly weapon, [driving on a] suspended license, expired registration, reckless driving, and a broken taillight\", which placed Madea on house arrest, while her granddaughter was bailed for $5,000.\n\nIn ''Family Reunion'', she violated the terms of house arrest by taking off her house arrest bracelet but was given the opportunity to avoid jail by becoming a foster mother.\n\nIn ''Meet the Browns'', Madea was stopped by police as a normal [[traffic stop]], only to refuse to pull over (fearing that she'll be sent to jail again), which leads her into a high-speed car chase with several law enforcement officials and news helicopters.\n\nIn ''Goes to Jail'', Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail. She, however, began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties. Madea's brother Joe (also played by Perry) refers to her as a \"po-po ho\", meaning someone who is a professional at evading [[police|law enforcement]].\n\n==Personality==\n===Hard side and language use===\nScurrilous, wise cracking, and saucy in remarks and behavior, Madea is full of comical sass and vulgar and abusive language. She also has many catch phrases, such as \"You crazy as hell,\" and \"I oughta punch you in da face!\" In addition, she uses [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] and other various urban expressions. Madea also intentionally adds a mispronounced \"t\" sound to many of her words, such as \"Africant Americant\", \"cooking and cleanting\" and \"living for da Lort [Lord].\"\n\nMadea is mostly noted for her outrageous overreactions and thuggish toughness over which she has shown no shame. For example, the character has four general methods of attack:\n# [[Property damage|Destruction of property]], such as demolishing others' household appliances with a chainsaw\n# Weapon violence, such as stabbing others with a lit cigarette\n# Physical violence, such as strangling and pounding others with her bare hands and elbows\n# Intimidation through outrageous browbeating tactics and threats, such as firing off her [[Glock]] pistol, which she keeps handy with her in her purse at all times (from the extended interval of rapid-fire sounds in ''[[Madea Goes To Jail]]'', it is implied that she owns a fully automatic assault-rifle, as well, but only brings it out on \"special occasions\")\n# Murder, such as shooting and stabbing others with a gun and a knife. When using guns, Madea shoots around targets, using intimidation rather than actually killing or injuring anyone. As another form of intimidation, Madea frequently boasts of having killed in the past. As an example, she once claimed to have murdered [[Jimmy Hoffa]] over him calling her a wild woman. She also claimed to have shot [[Tupac Shakur]] while arguing over a parking space; although she claims not to have killed him in the shooting.\n\n===Soft side===\nIn spite of her outrageous and shocking behaviors, Madea is consultative, protective, loving, and motherly at heart. This is heavily evidenced in ''Gets a Job'', in which Madea provides life lessons, guidance, and direction to all the residents and staff members of a nursing home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/02/madea-saves-all-again-%E2%80%98madea-gets-job%E2%80%99 |title=Madea saves all again in 'Madea Gets a Job' &#124; HamptonRoads.com &#124; PilotOnline.com |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref> Moreover, on numerous occasions, Madea has accepted family members who were without a place to stay into her home on her own accord. These family members have included her granddaughter Helen (''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' film), granddaughter Vianne (''I Can Do Bad All by Myself''), her great niece Vanessa and her two kids (''Madea's Family Reunion''), and ex-convict Bobby Mitchell (''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'').\n\nQuite often, Madea has offered direction and guidance to those who were being abused within their romantic relationships. Much of this direction and guidance tends to come in the form of extreme warmongering.\n\nMadea also instructs troubled individuals about the mistakes they've made in their life choices and leads them down the path of [[forgiveness]] and improvement. While in prison in the film ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea attends an anger management church meeting under duress. During the meeting, Madea ends up lecturing all the women to stop playing victims, stop whining, and start taking action to improve their lives.\n\nMadea is mentally strong and offers nurturing advice to struggling individuals whom she cares for.\n\n===Pet peeves===\nMadea has a series of [[pet peeve]]s: disrespectful youth, gum popping, people who steal her parking space, rude people; lazy people; people who don't return shopping carts; [[Adultery|adulterous]] people; and \"people who are just plain stupid.\" She is also a firm critic of men that [[Sagging (fashion)|sag their pants]], believing that it looks cheap and sloppy.\n\n==Madea's family==\n('''Note:''' There are a few discrepancies and [[plot hole]]s in Madea's family tree as between the regular films and the stage-plays)\n\n===Madea's mother===\nIn the book ''Tyler Perry's Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings'', Madea gives details on her mother, \"Big Mabel\" Murphy, who was described as \"unusually large\". It is presumed that Madea is named after her mother and probably went by the nickname \u201cLittle Mabel\u201d to distinct her from her mother. \"Big Mabel\" is characterized as being very gentle, mild-mannered, kind and peaceful woman, with a long and very dangerous fuse.This took a toll on Madea as she grew up with little knowledge of the Bible and has a tendency to comedically misquote the Word.\n\n===Siblings===\n'''Madea's brothers'''<br />According to ''Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings'', Madea has several brothers. Three of them are Frederick (revealed in the book), Joe, and Heathrow (revealed in ''Madea's Family Funeral'').\n\n::'''''Brother: Joe''''' \n::Joe (also played by Perry) is Madea's most recognizable brother as he lives with her and frequently appears in Madea films. A [[wikt:smart aleck|wise guy]] who is very coarse, misbehaved, and ornery, Joe has no qualms with such tendencies as openly farting and hurling about insulting wisecracks about people, including Madea. Despite being elderly, he constantly makes crude [[Flirting|passes]] at younger women. Joe regularly smokes marijuana in spite of his need to be on oxygen. On smoking marijuana, Joe has stated, ''\"God made this for us. God made this little tree, Viagra and oxygen. Put them altogether and you can take a woman to heaven and back!\"'' Joe has at least three children: Brian, Donna, and George Needleman.\n\n::('''Note:''' The Joe character precedes the Madea character in debut, as Joe's first appearance was in the 1998 play [[''I Know I've Been Changed'']], taking place when the Madea character had not yet originated. After one other play, Madea is unveiled in the 1999 play [[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (play)|''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'']] as Joe's sister)\n\n::::'''''Joe's children: Brian, Donna, and George'''''\n::::Brian (also played by Perry) is a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal defense attorney]], who often gets roped into Madea's messes as he represents her in the many criminal trials Madea lands herself in. He is married to Debra and has two children, Tiffany and BJ (Brian Jr.). Joe's daughter, Donna, is married to Isaac. She appeared in ''Madea's Family Reunion''.\n\n::::In ''Madea's Witness Protection'', Joe discovers that he has a biracial son named George Needleman with his long-lost flame Barbara. Barbara confirms this by comparing George's age to how many years ago Joe had the affair with her. However, George never finds out about this despite several hints from Joe. Therefore, George is Madea's nephew.\n\n::'''''Brother: Heathrow''''' \n::Heathrow (also played by Perry) is Madea\u2019s older brother. He made his debut in A Madea Family Funeral as the wheelchair-bound father of Vianne (Madea has a granddaughter of the same name) and grandfather of her children. Heathrow was a lifelong smoker and as a result uses a speech device to communicate in a robotic voice. Madea apparently warned Heathrow about the dangers of smoking cigarettes and urged him to quit before it got out of hand. This seems a bit hypocritical, as Madea is shown to be a heavy smoker as well and is almost always seen with a cigarette in her hand or mouth. Heathrow revealed that he was in the Vietnam war and was a decorated veteran, which would explain how he lost his legs. Madea refutes this, however, stating that he lost his legs due to an altercation with the mob and his medals were purchased from a costume shop. Heathrow is also a heavy marijuana user like his brother and sister. He appears to be the less favored of the Murphy-Baker siblings, because both Madea and Joe hate answering his phone calls. This could also explain why he was never mentioned before. In \u201cMadea\u2019s Family Reunion,\u201d Madea mentions to Judge Mablean that Joe is \u201cher only brother.\u201d This could mean that she does not claim Heathrow, though this is up for debate. Heathrow was married to Vianne\u2019s unnamed mother for many years and stated that he was so happy when she died, and that she smelled like a nursing home.\n\n::'''''Brothers: Frederick Baker and Willie Humphries''''' \n::Frederick and Willie are Madea\u2019s half-brothers, mentioned in her book. Not much is known about Frederick as he is only mentioned by name. Willie is the illegitimate brother of Madea, whom she briefly married before realizing they were related. After the revelation, she demanded a divorce and the two were not known to have spoken since.\n\n'''''Madea's sister'''''<br />In ''Madea's Family Reunion'', it was revealed that Madea has a younger sister named Irene Andrews, who has a son named Sonny and a daughter named Victoria. The play begins with everyone leaving Irene's funeral. Madea was shown as not caring much for her sister; in fact, not only does Madea claim she's happy Irene's died, but she has also said Irene probably killed herself to get out of repaying Madea 20 dollars, which Madea looked for by searching Irene\u2019s bra during her funeral. In ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea helps out Sonny by letting him and his wife Vanessa, along with their newborn Sonny Jr., stay at her home rent-free.\n\nIrene\u2019s daughter Victoria makes her debut in \u2018\u2019Madea\u2019s Family Reunion (film)\u2019\u2019 and is depicted as a wealthy snob who is harshly critical of her adult daughters Lisa and Vanessa. Victoria revealed in a tearful rant that Irene was a prostitute with a drug problem and that she traded Victoria for $10 and a dose of crack cocaine when she was young. Victoria\u2019s parenting was no better than her mother\u2019s, as she showed favoritism to Lisa because her father had money and Vanessa\u2019s father was an aspiring musician. She is shown to be well aware of the abuse that Lisa suffers at the hands of her fianc\u00e9 Carlos, but she tells her to put up with it and stop making him angry in an effort to merge the families together and increase their wealth. Towards the end of the film though, Victoria has a change of heart and attempts to reconcile with both of her daughters, which she succeeds in doing so. Victoria\u2019s bond with her Aunt Madea is mostly neutral, and there seems to be a bit of long-standing friction between aunt and niece that was ever present in each of their verbal exchanges. It can be assumed that Victoria is a blood relation to Madea as she refers to Joe as \u201cUncle Joe,\u201d meaning that Joe is both Madea and Irene\u2019s brother.\n\n===Madea's parenting, husbands, and children===\nIn ''Madea and Heathrow'', it was revealed that Madea supported her children by [[Stripper|stripping]], [[Pole dance|pole dancing]],  [[professional wrestling]], and cannibalism, among other things.\n\nMadea has buried nine husbands, among them Johnny and Carl. Madea claims to have shot some of them, poisoned others with her sweet potato pie and ate the rest. After each husband died, they were buried quickly and Madea collected their life insurance checks. Each time it's happened, Madea has stated \"I'm tryin' to get to the insurance company by five, and the casino by nine!\"\n\n'''''First husband: Johnny Simmons'''''<br />Madea killed her first husband Johnny Simmons (deceased), the father of Michelle and William. Madea implies that she was glad when he died and that he was stubborn and abusive. She ate Johnny and fed the leftovers to her children. Johnny\u2019s niece Vickie appears in ''Family Reunion''; she is there  mother of four sons.  Madea poisoned her second husband. In \u201cMadea\u2019s Class Reunion,\u201d Madea reveals to Diana that she had been married 102 times, though Madea has a tendency to exaggerate.\n\n:::'''''Daughter with first husband: Michelle Griffin'''''\n:::Madea's daughter, Michelle Griffin, was born when Madea and her first husband, Johnny, were teenagers. Michelle grew up to be a fugitive and neglectful mother of two daughters of her own, Maylee and Vianne, who appear in the play, ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself''. Michelle's children might have different fathers. \n:::Michelle's husband was a drunk who didn't spend enough time with either of his children. Madea explains that Michelle did not know the father of Maylee and called her \"Maybe\" because she was unaware of her father. Madea changed it to \"Maylee\" when she took her and Vianne out of the projects to raise them. Maylee has a 14-year-old daughter Keisha, who is also seen as a product of a neglectful mother. Keisha lived with her great-grandmother while Maylee lives her own life. Maylee reveals that Michelle allowed her drug dealer to have sex with Maylee in exchange for more drugs, which resulted in the birth of Keisha when Maylee was 15. Keisha ended up pregnant by a classmate named Kelly, and the unnamed child is presumably Madea\u2019s first great-great-grandchild.\n\n'''''Daughter: Cora Simmons'''''<br />Madea's daughter, Cora Jean Simmons, is her most recognized and only child to appear in most of the plays and movies. Cora is 44 in ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman''. She was born in 1953 when Madea was 18. Cora is a devout Baptist and is often in the company of her father Leroy Brown.\n\nTina and Lisa only appear in ''Family Reunion'', but are the only granddaughters to be mentioned all the time. They are Cora\u2019s daughters with her late husband, who has never been seen or named.\n\nCora thought that Johnny was her father until ''Class Reunion'', in which Madea reminded Cora that she [Cora] was the product of a one-night stand with Leroy Brown during their prom in 1953. So, she eats Mr. Brown and makes chitterlings out of him. This suggests that Madea is 68 years old in her first appearance, as well as in ''Madea's Class Reunion'' when her parents attend their 50th class reunion. Once Cora learned the truth, she became closer to Mr. Brown, visiting his family (in ''Meet the Browns'') and taking him to the hospital in ''What's Done in the Dark''. Their father/daughter plotline is shown on movies in ''Meet the Browns'', the TV series ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'', and its spin-off series ''[[Meet the Browns (TV series)|Meet the Browns]]''. In the movie, ''Madea's Big Happy Family'', Cora enlists the help of [[Maury Povich]] to find out if Leroy Brown is in fact her father. DNA tests reveal that he is not the father of Cora.\n\nIn ''Madea's Big Happy Family'' there is no apparent relation between Leroy Brown and Cora other than friends, but she still views him as a father.\n\n'''''Son: William Simmons'''''<br />William is Madea's youngest child and only son. Depending on the chronological order of the plays, William could be younger than Cora. William is also deceased, making Cora the only surviving child of Madea. Madea has not mentioned her son at all, and his existence is only proven in \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d when Helen reveals to Orlando that Madea is her paternal grandmother. As far as the plays, Myrtle only appears in the ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman''. She is, however, mentioned in the ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'' play. In the plays, Myrtle is in her 50s. In the film timeline, Myrtle is in her 70s, and is placed in a retirement home. This shows a natural propensity to disregard timelines humorously, because Madea herself is only in her mid-70s, meaning either Myrtle looks older than she is or William married an older woman.\n\nWilliam and Myrtle have three children: Helen, Jackie, and Gina, all of whom have either appeared or been mentioned in one of the plays (though only Helen is mentioned in the movie). William's oldest daughter, Helen, is in her mid to late 30s in ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'', which makes William in his 50s. He died from eating Mrytle\u2019s belly after making pork chops out of it. It is presumed that he was also a Christian, which is odd considering Madea is overall irreligious.\n\n==Media and entertainment featuring Madea==\nMadea has appeared in several plays (some of which have been recorded for repeated viewing), fully produced films, a couple of [[television program]]s ([[guest appearance]]s), one book and one [[animation|animated film]]. The character made her first appearance in the 1999 play ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'', later appearing in numerous other plays by Perry, then appearing in films based on those plays.\n\n===Plays (including recorded plays)===\n* ''[[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (play)|I Can Do Bad All By Myself]]''\u20141999\n* ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (play)|Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]''\u20142001\n* ''[[Madea's Family Reunion (play)|Madea's Family Reunion]]''\u20142002\n* ''[[Madea's Class Reunion]]''\u20142003\n* ''[[Madea Goes to Jail (play)|Madea Goes to Jail]]''\u20142006\n* ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family]]''\u20142010\n* ''[[A Madea Christmas (musical play)|A Madea Christmas]]''\u20142011\n* ''[[Madea Gets a Job]]''\u20142012\n* ''[[Madea's Neighbors from Hell]]''\u20142013\n* ''Madea on the Run''\u20142015\n* ''[[Madea's Farewell]]''\u20142019\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]''\u20142005\n* ''[[Madea's Family Reunion]]''\u20142006\n* ''[[Meet the Browns (film)|Meet the Browns]]'' (cameo)\u20142008\n* ''[[Madea Goes to Jail]]''\u20142009\n* ''[[I Can Do Bad All by Myself (film)|I Can Do Bad All by Myself]]''\u20142009\n* ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family (film)|Madea's Big Happy Family]]''\u20142011\n* ''[[Madea's Witness Protection]]''\u20142012\n* ''[[A Madea Christmas (film)|A Madea Christmas]]''\u20142013\n* ''[[Boo!

Jones led the public to believe that the decision had come amid Perry's prior obligations, assisting [[Oprah Winfrey]] with her struggling [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN]] network. As part of the prank, Jones released a photo of himself to the public in which he was impersonating Madea. In addition, he incorporated several pretend quotes seemingly issued by Perry, both acknowledging the news and giving Jones his blessing to continue on with the character. Unaware of the prank, fans responded with outrage and criticism. As result of increasing outcries from fans, Perry informed the public on April 15, 2013, that the news was untrue. Perry was quoted as stating, \"That was an April Fool's joke that ''HE'' did. Not true. And not funny. When I'm done with Madea, she is done.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Tracy |url=http://s2smagazine.com/70127/tyler-perry-calls-orlando-jones-news-not-true-and-not-funny/ |title=Tyler Perry calls Orlando Jones' news 'not true and not funny' |publisher=S2SMagazine.com |accessdate=2013-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128021140/http://s2smagazine.com/70127/tyler-perry-calls-orlando-jones-news-not-true-and-not-funny/ |archivedate=2014-01-28 }}</ref>\n\n===Criticism===\nPerry has been accused of [[Blackface|minstrelsy]] and playing into black stereotypes with the Madea character, most notably by fellow black director [[Spike Lee]].

Her maiden name is unknown, but it is presumably either Baker or Murphy as they were the last names of her father and mother, respectively. (Madea was 65 in the first play, ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'', as well as ''Madea's Class Reunion''. Her ages in the other plays are unknown because they take place between these two plays, and there's no continuity offered. In ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea was around 75). In \"I Can Do Bad All by Myself,\" she reveals she once lived in Cleveland, Ohio, but later returned to Atlanta. Madea was a hooker and a stripper.\n\nMadea was brought up in poverty and grew up living in a shotgun house with her parents and siblings. Madea has stated that although her family didn't have much, they had love.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsi6IY4Jn3kC&pg=PT12&dq=Big+Mabel+Murphy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y3bsUPLABejy2QWrnoGgAg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ |title=Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings: Madea's Uninhibited ... - Tyler Perry - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>\nShe even claimed that her daddy would go outside and hunt for dogs and cook them on the stove to eat for dinner.\nAccording to ''Family Reunion'', Madea's mother, \"Big Mabel\" Murphy, was a [[Prostitute|hooker]] during Madea's childhood and was not at all religious. As a result, Madea grew up with little knowledge of [[Baptism]] (as an elderly woman, Madea has a tendency to misquote the [[Bible]]).\n\nShe attended Booker T. Washington High School, where she served as a cheerleader. When Madea was 16, her parents moved her and the rest of her immediate family to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in a barn house. It was reported in Madea's book, ''[[Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings]]'', that Madea's mother and father wouldn't allow her to go out at all until she turned 18.\n\nIn the films, it has been revealed that Madea used to be a stripper, and her stage names were Platinum and Delicious. It is heavily implied that she was a hooker as well.\n\n==Criminal background==\nMadea has a lifelong [[criminal record]] that began at age 9 with a charge of  [[theft]]. It is also reported that Madea was charged with her first felony at this age, and her crimes began progressing to [[illegal gambling]] at age 18, which later evolved into [[Cheque fraud|check fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[insurance fraud]] (presumably related to her nine deceased husbands), [[assault]], [[attempted murder]], vehicle theft (mostly Lexus vehicles, the first vehicle she ever stole being a 1992 [[Lexus LS400]]), [[reckless driving]] (including smashing through objects, notably a mansion gate, a [[Cadillac CTS]], and a fast food window in ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]'', ''Goes to Jail'', and ''Big Happy Family'' respectively) and forklifting vehicles out of parking spaces (usually for taking spaces that she wants to park at, as she did to many [[Toyota Camry|Camrys]] and [[Scion (automobile)|Scions]], as well as a [[Pontiac Solstice]] that she ruined in ''Madea Goes to Jail''). Throughout the series, she is a repeat offender.\n\nIn ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' alone, Madea and her granddaughter Helen McCarter were both charged with \"criminal [[trespass]]ing, reckless [[endangerment]], criminal possession of a [[handgun]], assault with a deadly weapon, [driving on a] suspended license, expired registration, reckless driving, and a broken taillight\", which placed Madea on house arrest, while her granddaughter was bailed for $5,000.\n\nIn ''Family Reunion'', she violated the terms of house arrest by taking off her house arrest bracelet but was given the opportunity to avoid jail by becoming a foster mother.\n\nIn ''Meet the Browns'', Madea was stopped by police as a normal [[traffic stop]], only to refuse to pull over (fearing that she'll be sent to jail again), which leads her into a high-speed car chase with several law enforcement officials and news helicopters.\n\nIn ''Goes to Jail'', Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail. She, however, began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties. Madea's brother Joe (also played by Perry) refers to her as a \"po-po ho\", meaning someone who is a professional at evading [[police|law enforcement]].\n\n==Personality==\n===Hard side and language use===\nScurrilous, wise cracking, and saucy in remarks and behavior, Madea is full of comical sass and vulgar and abusive language. She also has many catch phrases, such as \"You crazy as hell,\" and \"I oughta punch you in da face!\" In addition, she uses [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] and other various urban expressions. Madea also intentionally adds a mispronounced \"t\" sound to many of her words, such as \"Africant Americant\", \"cooking and cleanting\" and \"living for da Lort [Lord].\"\n\nMadea is mostly noted for her outrageous overreactions and thuggish toughness over which she has shown no shame. For example, the character has four general methods of attack:\n# [[Property damage|Destruction of property]], such as demolishing others' household appliances with a chainsaw\n# Weapon violence, such as stabbing others with a lit cigarette\n# Physical violence, such as strangling and pounding others with her bare hands and elbows\n# Intimidation through outrageous browbeating tactics and threats, such as firing off her [[Glock]] pistol, which she keeps handy with her in her purse at all times (from the extended interval of rapid-fire sounds in ''[[Madea Goes To Jail]]'', it is implied that she owns a fully automatic assault-rifle, as well, but only brings it out on \"special occasions\")\n# Murder, such as shooting and stabbing others with a gun and a knife. When using guns, Madea shoots around targets, using intimidation rather than actually killing or injuring anyone. As another form of intimidation, Madea frequently boasts of having killed in the past. As an example, she once claimed to have murdered [[Jimmy Hoffa]] over him calling her a wild woman. She also claimed to have shot [[Tupac Shakur]] while arguing over a parking space; although she claims not to have killed him in the shooting.\n\n===Soft side===\nIn spite of her outrageous and shocking behaviors, Madea is consultative, protective, loving, and motherly at heart. This is heavily evidenced in ''Gets a Job'', in which Madea provides life lessons, guidance, and direction to all the residents and staff members of a nursing home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/02/madea-saves-all-again-%E2%80%98madea-gets-job%E2%80%99 |title=Madea saves all again in 'Madea Gets a Job' &#124; HamptonRoads.com &#124; PilotOnline.com |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref> Moreover, on numerous occasions, Madea has accepted family members who were without a place to stay into her home on her own accord. These family members have included her granddaughter Helen (''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' film), granddaughter Vianne (''I Can Do Bad All by Myself''), her great niece Vanessa and her two kids (''Madea's Family Reunion''), and ex-convict Bobby Mitchell (''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'').\n\nQuite often, Madea has offered direction and guidance to those who were being abused within their romantic relationships. Much of this direction and guidance tends to come in the form of extreme warmongering.\n\nMadea also instructs troubled individuals about the mistakes they've made in their life choices and leads them down the path of [[forgiveness]] and improvement. While in prison in the film ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea attends an anger management church meeting under duress. During the meeting, Madea ends up lecturing all the women to stop playing victims, stop whining, and start taking action to improve their lives.\n\nMadea is mentally strong and offers nurturing advice to struggling individuals whom she cares for.\n\n===Pet peeves===\nMadea has a series of [[pet peeve]]s: disrespectful youth, gum popping, people who steal her parking space, rude people; lazy people; people who don't return shopping carts; [[Adultery|adulterous]] people; and \"people who are just plain stupid.\" She is also a firm critic of men that [[Sagging (fashion)|sag their pants]], believing that it looks cheap and sloppy.\n\n==Madea's family==\n('''Note:''' There are a few discrepancies and [[plot hole]]s in Madea's family tree as between the regular films and the stage-plays)\n\n===Madea's mother===\nIn the book ''Tyler Perry's Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings'', Madea gives details on her mother, \"Big Mabel\" Murphy, who was described as \"unusually large\". It is presumed that Madea is named after her mother and probably went by the nickname \u201cLittle Mabel\u201d to distinct her from her mother. \"Big Mabel\" is characterized as being very gentle, mild-mannered, kind and peaceful woman, with a long and very dangerous fuse.This took a toll on Madea as she grew up with little knowledge of the Bible and has a tendency to comedically misquote the Word.\n\n===Siblings===\n'''Madea's brothers'''<br />According to ''Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings'', Madea has several brothers. Three of them are Frederick (revealed in the book), Joe, and Heathrow (revealed in ''Madea's Family Funeral'').\n\n::'''''Brother: Joe''''' \n::Joe (also played by Perry) is Madea's most recognizable brother as he lives with her and frequently appears in Madea films. A [[wikt:smart aleck|wise guy]] who is very coarse, misbehaved, and ornery, Joe has no qualms with such tendencies as openly farting and hurling about insulting wisecracks about people, including Madea. Despite being elderly, he constantly makes crude [[Flirting|passes]] at younger women. Joe regularly smokes marijuana in spite of his need to be on oxygen. On smoking marijuana, Joe has stated, ''\"God made this for us. God made this little tree, Viagra and oxygen. Put them altogether and you can take a woman to heaven and back!\"'' Joe has at least three children: Brian, Donna, and George Needleman.\n\n::('''Note:''' The Joe character precedes the Madea character in debut, as Joe's first appearance was in the 1998 play [[''I Know I've Been Changed'']], taking place when the Madea character had not yet originated. After one other play, Madea is unveiled in the 1999 play [[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (play)|''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'']] as Joe's sister)\n\n::::'''''Joe's children: Brian, Donna, and George'''''\n::::Brian (also played by Perry) is a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal defense attorney]], who often gets roped into Madea's messes as he represents her in the many criminal trials Madea lands herself in. He is married to Debra and has two children, Tiffany and BJ (Brian Jr.). Joe's daughter, Donna, is married to Isaac. She appeared in ''Madea's Family Reunion''.\n\n::::In ''Madea's Witness Protection'', Joe discovers that he has a biracial son named George Needleman with his long-lost flame Barbara. Barbara confirms this by comparing George's age to how many years ago Joe had the affair with her. However, George never finds out about this despite several hints from Joe. Therefore, George is Madea's nephew.\n\n::'''''Brother: Heathrow''''' \n::Heathrow (also played by Perry) is Madea\u2019s older brother. He made his debut in A Madea Family Funeral as the wheelchair-bound father of Vianne (Madea has a granddaughter of the same name) and grandfather of her children. Heathrow was a lifelong smoker and as a result uses a speech device to communicate in a robotic voice. Madea apparently warned Heathrow about the dangers of smoking cigarettes and urged him to quit before it got out of hand. This seems a bit hypocritical, as Madea is shown to be a heavy smoker as well and is almost always seen with a cigarette in her hand or mouth. Heathrow revealed that he was in the Vietnam war and was a decorated veteran, which would explain how he lost his legs. Madea refutes this, however, stating that he lost his legs due to an altercation with the mob and his medals were purchased from a costume shop. Heathrow is also a heavy marijuana user like his brother and sister. He appears to be the less favored of the Murphy-Baker siblings, because both Madea and Joe hate answering his phone calls. This could also explain why he was never mentioned before. In \u201cMadea\u2019s Family Reunion,\u201d Madea mentions to Judge Mablean that Joe is \u201cher only brother.\u201d This could mean that she does not claim Heathrow, though this is up for debate. Heathrow was married to Vianne\u2019s unnamed mother for many years and stated that he was so happy when she died, and that she smelled like a nursing home.\n\n::'''''Brothers: Frederick Baker and Willie Humphries''''' \n::Frederick and Willie are Madea\u2019s half-brothers, mentioned in her book. Not much is known about Frederick as he is only mentioned by name. Willie is the illegitimate brother of Madea, whom she briefly married before realizing they were related. After the revelation, she demanded a divorce and the two were not known to have spoken since.\n\n'''''Madea's sister'''''<br />In ''Madea's Family Reunion'', it was revealed that Madea has a younger sister named Irene Andrews, who has a son named Sonny and a daughter named Victoria. The play begins with everyone leaving Irene's funeral. Madea was shown as not caring much for her sister; in fact, not only does Madea claim she's happy Irene's died, but she has also said Irene probably killed herself to get out of repaying Madea 20 dollars, which Madea looked for by searching Irene\u2019s bra during her funeral. In ''Madea Goes to Jail'', Madea helps out Sonny by letting him and his wife Vanessa, along with their newborn Sonny Jr., stay at her home rent-free.\n\nIrene\u2019s daughter Victoria makes her debut in \u2018\u2019Madea\u2019s Family Reunion (film)\u2019\u2019 and is depicted as a wealthy snob who is harshly critical of her adult daughters Lisa and Vanessa. Victoria revealed in a tearful rant that Irene was a prostitute with a drug problem and that she traded Victoria for $10 and a dose of crack cocaine when she was young. Victoria\u2019s parenting was no better than her mother\u2019s, as she showed favoritism to Lisa because her father had money and Vanessa\u2019s father was an aspiring musician. She is shown to be well aware of the abuse that Lisa suffers at the hands of her fianc\u00e9 Carlos, but she tells her to put up with it and stop making him angry in an effort to merge the families together and increase their wealth. Towards the end of the film though, Victoria has a change of heart and attempts to reconcile with both of her daughters, which she succeeds in doing so. Victoria\u2019s bond with her Aunt Madea is mostly neutral, and there seems to be a bit of long-standing friction between aunt and niece that was ever present in each of their verbal exchanges. It can be assumed that Victoria is a blood relation to Madea as she refers to Joe as \u201cUncle Joe,\u201d meaning that Joe is both Madea and Irene\u2019s brother.\n\n===Madea's parenting, husbands, and children===\nIn ''Madea and Heathrow, it was revealed that Madea supported her children by [[Stripper|stripping]], [[Pole dance|pole dancing]],  [[professional wrestling]], and cannibalism, among other things.\n\nMadea has buried nine husbands, among them Johnny and Carl. Madea claims to have shot some of them, poisoned others with her sweet potato pie and ate the rest. After each husband died, they were buried quickly and Madea collected their life insurance checks. Each time it's happened, Madea has stated \"I'm tryin' to get to the insurance company by five, and the casino by nine!\"\n\n'''''First husband: Johnny Simmons'''''<br />Madea killed her first husband Johnny Simmons (deceased), the father of Michelle and William. Madea implies that she was glad when he died and that he was stubborn and abusive. She ate Johnny and fed the leftovers to her children. Johnny\u2019s niece Vickie appears in ''Family Reunion''; she is there  mother of four sons.  Madea poisoned her second husband. In \u201cMadea\u2019s Class Reunion,\u201d Madea reveals to Diana that she had been married 102 times, though Madea has a tendency to exaggerate.\n\n:::'''''Daughter with first husband: Michelle Griffin'''''\n:::Madea's daughter, Michelle Griffin, was born when Madea and her first husband, Johnny, were teenagers. Michelle grew up to be a fugitive and neglectful mother of two daughters of her own, Maylee and Vianne, who appear in the play, ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself''. Michelle's children might have different fathers. \n:::Michelle's husband was a drunk who didn't spend enough time with either of his children. Madea explains that Michelle did not know the father of Maylee and called her \"Maybe\" because she was unaware of her father. Madea changed it to \"Maylee\" when she took her and Vianne out of the projects to raise them. Maylee has a 14-year-old daughter Keisha, who is also seen as a product of a neglectful mother. Keisha lived with her great-grandmother while Maylee lives her own life. Maylee reveals that Michelle allowed her drug dealer to have sex with Maylee in exchange for more drugs, which resulted in the birth of Keisha when Maylee was 15. Keisha ended up pregnant by a classmate named Kelly, and the unnamed child is presumably Madea\u2019s first great-great-grandchild.\n\n'''''Daughter: Cora Simmons'''''<br />Madea's daughter, Cora Jean Simmons, is her most recognized and only child to appear in most of the plays and movies. Cora is 44 in ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman''. She was born in 1953 when Madea was 18. Cora is a devout Baptist and is often in the company of her father Leroy Brown.\n\nTina and Lisa only appear in ''Family Reunion'', but are the only granddaughters to be mentioned all the time. They are Cora\u2019s daughters with her late husband, who has never been seen or named.\n\nCora thought that Johnny was her father until ''Class Reunion'', in which Madea reminded Cora that she [Cora] was the product of a one-night stand with Leroy Brown during their prom in 1953. So, she eats Mr. Brown and makes chitterlings out of him. This suggests that Madea is 68 years old in her first appearance, as well as in ''Madea's Class Reunion'' when her parents attend their 50th class reunion. Once Cora learned the truth, she became closer to Mr. Brown, visiting his family (in ''Meet the Browns'') and taking him to the hospital in ''What's Done in the Dark''. Their father/daughter plotline is shown on movies in ''Meet the Browns'', the TV series ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'', and its spin-off series ''[[Meet the Browns (TV series)|Meet the Browns]]''. In the movie, ''Madea's Big Happy Family'', Cora enlists the help of [[Maury Povich]] to find out if Leroy Brown is in fact her father. DNA tests reveal that he is not the father of Cora.\n\nIn ''Madea's Big Happy Family'' there is no apparent relation between Leroy Brown and Cora other than friends, but she still views him as a father.\n\n'''''Son: William Simmons'''''<br />William is Madea's youngest child and only son. Depending on the chronological order of the plays, William could be younger than Cora. William is also deceased, making Cora the only surviving child of Madea. Madea has not mentioned her son at all, and his existence is only proven in \u201cDiary of a Mad Black Woman\u201d when Helen reveals to Orlando that Madea is her paternal grandmother. As far as the plays, Myrtle only appears in the ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman''. She is, however, mentioned in the ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'' play. In the plays, Myrtle is in her 50s. In the film timeline, Myrtle is in her 70s, and is placed in a retirement home. This shows a natural propensity to disregard timelines humorously, because Madea herself is only in her mid-70s, meaning either Myrtle looks older than she is or William married an older woman.\n\nWilliam and Myrtle have three children: Helen, Jackie, and Gina, all of whom have either appeared or been mentioned in one of the plays (though only Helen is mentioned in the movie). William's oldest daughter, Helen, is in her mid to late 30s in ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'', which makes William in his 50s. He died from eating Mrytle\u2019s belly after making pork chops out of it. It is presumed that he was also a Christian, which is odd considering Madea is overall irreligious.\n\n==Media and entertainment featuring Madea==\nMadea has appeared in several plays (some of which have been recorded for repeated viewing), fully produced films, a couple of [[television program]]s ([[guest appearance]]s), one book and one [[animation|animated film]]. The character made her first appearance in the 1999 play ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'', later appearing in numerous other plays by Perry, then appearing in films based on those plays.\n\n===Plays (including recorded plays)===\n* ''[[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (play)|I Can Do Bad All By Myself]]''\u20141999\n* ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (play)|Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]''\u20142001\n* ''[[Madea's Family Reunion (play)|Madea's Family Reunion]]''\u20142002\n* ''[[Madea's Class Reunion]]''\u20142003\n* ''[[Madea Goes to Jail (play)|Madea Goes to Jail]]''\u20142006\n* ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family]]''\u20142010\n* ''[[A Madea Christmas (musical play)|A Madea Christmas]]''\u20142011\n* ''[[Madea Gets a Job]]''\u20142012\n* ''[[Madea's Neighbors from Hell]]''\u20142013\n* ''Madea on the Run''\u20142015\n* ''[[Madea's Farewell]]''\u20142019\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]''\u20142005\n* ''[[Madea's Family Reunion]]''\u20142006\n* ''[[Meet the Browns (film)|Meet the Browns]]'' (cameo)\u20142008\n* ''[[Madea Goes to Jail]]''\u20142009\n* ''[[I Can Do Bad All by Myself (film)|I Can Do Bad All by Myself]]''\u20142009\n* ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family (film)|Madea's Big Happy Family]]''\u20142011\n* ''[[Madea's Witness Protection]]''\u20142012\n* ''[[A Madea Christmas (film)|A Madea Christmas]]''\u20142013\n* ''[[Boo!

As part of the prank, Jones released a photo of himself to the public in which he was impersonating Madea. In addition, he incorporated several pretend quotes seemingly issued by Perry, both acknowledging the news and giving Jones his blessing to continue on with the character. Unaware of the prank, fans responded with outrage and criticism. As result of increasing outcries from fans, Perry informed the public on April 15, 2013, that the news was untrue. Perry was quoted as stating, \"That was an April Fool's joke that ''HE'' did. Not true. And not funny.

She was bored of the monotonous daily life in the [[palace]] and desired exciting adventures. One day, she opened the \"Door Which Shouldn't Be Opened\" in the basement of Castle Victory, said to lead to a savage and deadly place. As she dared cross the doorway, it caused her to fall from the skies and to another realm called Fantasy World, which was dominated by the evil Emperor Dante. After her flowing dress was lost while catching the wind for her fall, the perilous adventures of Princess Athena began as she landed in a [[wilderness]] overrun by beast-like warriors and more dangers than she could ever wish for. She readied to fight for her life and arm herself, with no other choice than to face the ruthless Dante and every obstacle on her way, to free this kingdom and make it back alive to her own.\n\nAfter Athena defeats Dante, it all begins anew in the sequel, ''[[Athena: Full Throttle]]'', in which the princess, again bored, opens the \"Door Which Shouldn't Be Opened '''B'''\", disregarding her loyal maid Helene's advice, and they both fall to Elysium World, where they face off against other villains.\n\nMany of the game's elements are inspired by [[Greek mythology]] or [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], such as [[weapon]]s, equipment, items and enemy designs. Princess Athena herself is named after the Greek goddess [[Athena]], while Dante is based on [[Cerberus]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nUpon landing, unarmed and nearly [[nudity|nude]], the princess only has her kicks to fend off the approaching [[monster]]s, but she may collect the dead enemies's various weapons and also has the chance to find [[shield]]s, headgear and [[body armor|armor]] to cover her body, however, these will be lost after withstanding some attacks. Her journey requires leaping and climbing as well as fighting through the land's eight hazardous worlds, each leading up to an oversized enemy that must be dealt with before proceeding to the next area. The use of certain weapons such as a [[hammer]] allows Athena to break through stone blocks, sometimes revealing not only armor but [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] items such as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]'s sandals that, when worn, allow her to make great leaps.\n\nThe game features certain [[role-playing video game]] elements to complement the platform action. Princess Athena has to defeat enemies such as the final [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] by using various mythological weapons, items and equipment.

Under an obscure law known as the ''Jus Devolutionis'', [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] claimed these provinces 'devolved' to him by right of marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].\n\nThe French encountered minimal resistance but returned much of their gains in the May 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The terms had been agreed by Louis and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] in January 1668, reinforced by the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nAlthough the conflict was relatively minor, it marks the breaking point of the long alliance between France and the Dutch Republic and was the first of the wars of expansion fought by Louis that dominated Europe for the next 50 years.\n\n==Background==\nAs part of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] that ended the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|Franco-Spanish War]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] married [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the [[Spanish Empire]] remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by [[Kingdom of France|France]], Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold [[French \u00e9cu|\u00e9cus]], a huge sum that was never paid.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}}\n\nWhen [[Cardinal Mazarin]] died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=6}} [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], his Finance Minister, argued French economic growth required the [[Spanish Netherlands]], implying conflict with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], a long-term French ally. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] that confirmed Dutch independence also gave [[Amsterdam]] control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nBy 1663, Louis concluded the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions.{{sfn|Rowan|1954|p=3}} As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in July 1665, providing an excuse for their military build up; Louis also calculated this made it harder for the Dutch to oppose him.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=298}} In September, Philip died, leaving his four year old son [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] as king, and his widow [[Mariana of Austria]] as regent. If Charles died, Leopold would inherit the Spanish Empire.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311-312}}\n[[File:Detail of Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Autriche by Nocret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Theresa of Spain]], whose unpaid dowry was used to justify the war]]\nFrench lawyers argued as the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa's renunciation was invalid, and her rights \"devolved\" to Louis under the ''Jus Devolutionis'', an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], the towns of [[Cambrai]], Antwerp and [[Mechelen]], [[Upper Guelders]], the counties of [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and related possessions.{{sfn|Wolf|1962|p=316}} It was dismissed by Leopold and Mariana, since it applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights but gave Louis a legal justification.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=33-34}}\n\nAware of French intentions, Mariana's government sought to end the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], agree an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship. Louis countered with the 1667 [[Treaty of Lisbon (1667)|Treaty of Lisbon]], a ten year alliance with Portugal, and paid potential opponents like [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to remain neutral.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=36}} Leopold was occupied with the [[Great Turkish War]], while Foreign Minister [[Hugues de Lionne]] also extended the anti-Austrian [[League of the Rhine]] until 1668.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=95-96}}\n\nOn 8 May, every French ambassador in Europe read out a declaration, claiming Louis was taking possession of lands that rightfully belonged to him. In mid-May, talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War opened in [[Breda]] between the Republic, [[Denmark-Norway]], France and England; shortly before, [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] learned Louis and Charles had secretly agreed terms in advance, increasing the pressure on the Dutch not to oppose French aims.{{sfn|Gooskens|2016|p=69}}\n\nThe imminence of war ended Spain's reluctance to accept Portuguese sovereignty; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 23 May, granted England substantial commercial privileges, in return for help in ending the war with Portugal.{{sfn|Fisher, Savelle|1967|pp=66-70}}\n\n==War==\n===May to September 1667; the Spanish Netherlands===\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Spanish Netherlands, 1667 campaign; note modern Franco-Belgian boundary, blue lines indicate rivers|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Oudenaarde|pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 3|lon_min = 36\n|label3 =Antwerp |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 13|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 24\n|label4 =Tournai |pos4=right|lat4_deg=50|lat4_min = 36|lon4_deg = 3|lon4_min = 23\n|label5= Charleroi|pos5=bottom|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 24|lon5_deg = 4|lon5_min = 26\n|label6 = Lille  |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 3 |lon6_min = 03\n|label7= Namur|pos7 = right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 28| lon7_deg = 4|lon7_min = 52\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9 = M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min =46 | lon9_deg =4 | lon9_min = 43\n|label10 = Sierck|pos10 = bottom|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min =26 | lon10_deg =6 | lon10_min = 21\n|label11 = Kortrijk|pos11 = left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min=50|lon11_deg =3 | lon11_min = 16\n|label12 = Brussels|pos12 = right|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min=41|lon12_deg =4 | lon12_min = 21\n|label13 = Dendermonde|pos13 = left|lat13_deg=51|lat13_min=02|lon13_deg =4 | lon13_min = 06\n|label14 = Aalst|pos14 = right|lat14_deg=50|lat14_min=56|lon14_deg =4 |lon14_min = 02\n}}\nAlso referred to as [[Flanders]], the Spanish Netherlands was a compact area, dominated by canals and rivers. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water; campaigns in this theatre focused on control of strongpoints along rivers such as the [[Lys (river)|Lys]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Childs|1991|pp=32-33}}\n\nAfter 1659, a series of military reforms initiated by [[Michel Le Tellier]] made the French army more professional, while improving its logistic support.{{sfn|Rowlands|2010|p=147}} This allowed them to put larger numbers in the field, for longer periods; by 1667, the army had an authorised strength of 80,000, of whom 51,000 were deployed for the campaign.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=106}}\n\n[[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] was appointed supreme commander; his main force of 35,000 men and the artillery train were concentrated around [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], on the River Meuse. Another 9,000 under [[Aumont family|Antoine de Rochebaron]] prepared to advance up the Lys, via [[Kortrijk]] and [[Oudenaarde]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy|de Cr\u00e9quy]] and 6,000 light cavalry were based at [[Sierck-les-Bains]], securing their flank against an attack from Germany. Accompanied by Louis and his entourage, the French crossed the border on 24 May.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|pp=299-300}}\n\nAware of these preparations, Spanish governor [[Francisco de Moura, 3rd Marquis of Castel Rodrigo|Castel Rodrigo]] urgently requested additional funds from Madrid. Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million [[escudos]] on her daughter's wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp34-36}}\n\nAlthough insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.{{sfn|Afflerbach & Strachan|2012|p=159}} \n[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Yser]] river, in [[Plain of Flanders|Maritime Flanders]]; a good example of the geography in this area]]\nTurenne's first objective was [[Charleroi]], a key Spanish supply base; Castel Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to [[Brussels]], first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, [[Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal|De Montal]] was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while [[Vauban]] began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured [[Tournai]], Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on [[Dendermonde]], intending to take Antwerp.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nOn 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castel Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt. Turenne withdrew and on 10 August [[Siege of Lille (1667)|besieged Lille]], capital of the [[Walloons|Walloon region]] and an important commercial centre.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nThe garrison were allowed to withdraw after surrendering on 28 August; three days later, [[John Gaspar Ferdinand de Marchin, Comte de Granville|de Marchin]] and a Spanish relief force of 12,000 ran into a French cavalry detachment on the Bruges road. Ordered to cut off his retreat, [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds|Bellefonds]] and de Cr\u00e9quy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both [[List of Marshals of France#Louis XIV, 1643\u20131715|Marshals of France]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=303}} On 12 September, Turenne captured [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=304}}\n\n===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===\n[[File:Johan de Witt 1652.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]]; he had to persuade Louis to withdraw, while keeping him as an ally]]\nOn 31 July 1667, the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} This was driven by the [[States of Zeeland]], supported by [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]], English ambassador in [[the Hague]] and [[Brussels]], and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's representative in London.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|p=5}}\n\nDe Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; 'to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=111}} Although he and Charles preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador in Sweden]], Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.{{sfn|Rowan|1954|p=6}}\n\nFrom April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=155}} Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and the general populace.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=7}} In England, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[City of London Corporation|business]] wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]]; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the [[Secret Treaty of Dover|1670 Treaty of Dover]]{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}}  \n\nIn September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.{{sfn|Rowan|1954|p=4}}\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], ca 1661]]\nWhen Philip died in 1665, Spain's only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] was deposed by his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]], who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|p=47}} The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Newitt|2004|p=228}}\n\nTo fund the 1668 campaign, Castel-Rodrigo agreed a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castel-Rodrigo [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=50-52}}\n\nOn 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September.{{sfn|Davenport, Paulin|1917|p=144,152}} The [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] was signed by England and the Republic on 23 January, the third member, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle.{{sfn|Davenport, Paullin|1917|p=166}} It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n\nRuvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=12}} Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent [[Franco-Dutch War]], Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the 'ungrateful Dutch nation', but his reaction at the time was far more moderate.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=23}} The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, 'the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money'.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=26}} Lionne also pointed out the Alliance's guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms 'without it costing us a sou.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=156}}\n\n===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comt\u00e9===\n{{Location map many|France Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9|caption = Modern department of Bourgogne (left) and Franche-Comt\u00e9 (right); key locations 1668 campaign |border = black|width =300|float = right|relief=yes|\n|label  = Besan\u00e7on   |pos = right|lat_deg =47|lat_min  = 14|lon_deg  = 6|lon_min = 1\n|label2 = Dole       |pos2 = right |lat2_deg=47|lat2_min = 05|lon2_deg = 5|lon2_min = 30\n|label3 = Gray       |pos3 = right |lat3_deg=47|lat3_min  =27|lon3_deg = 5|lon3_min = 36\n|label4 = Vesoul     |pos4 = right|lat4_deg=47|lat4_min  =37|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 10\n|label5 = Salins-les-Bains|pos5 = bottom|lat5_deg  =46|lat5_min  =57|lon5_deg  = 5|lon5_min = 53\n|label6  = Dijon     |pos6 = top |lat6_deg  =47|lat6_min=19|lon6_deg = 5|lon6_min = 01\n|label7  = Nevers    |pos7 = right  |lat7_deg  =47|lat7_min=00|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 10\n|label8  = Auxonne   |pos8 = left   |lat8_deg  =47|lat8_min  =12|lon8_deg  = 5|lon8_min = 23\n}}\nThroughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=112}}\n\nThe operation was commanded by the [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince de Cond\u00e9]]. Once France's leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comt\u00e9 was considered part of [[Burgundy]], his family's traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.{{sfn|Swann|2003|p=44}}\n\nTo keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans]] would attack [[Catalonia]], with Cond\u00e9 in the [[Three Bishoprics]] to deter an attack from Germany.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|pp=20-21}}\n\nThis provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in [[Dijon]]; by early February, Cond\u00e9 had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near [[Auxonne]].

His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 to 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of [[Gray, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Gray]] on 19th; Louis was back in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] on 24th.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=306}}\n\n===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===\nOn the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the [[Gaspar T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 5th Duke de Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], [[Viceroy of Catalonia]], invaded the [[Upper Cerdanya]] with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1997|p=9}} Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local ''[[miquelets]]'' combined with the French military in resisting the invasion.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1999|p=266}} Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.{{sfn|Jan\u00e9 Checa|2003|p=454}}\n\n===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===\nThe French army remained the largest in Europe and Turenne, Cond\u00e9 and Orl\u00e9ans argued for war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. The biggest obstacle was French mercantile dependence on Dutch shipping, and Colbert initiated policies to eventually eliminate this.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=153-154}}\n\nIn February, Charles was reported as dangerously ill; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives peacefully under the Partition Treaty. On the other hand, France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, while [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] offered Spain 8,000 men, in addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=163}}\n\nOn 25 April, he decided on peace; the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms for ending the war. These were included in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], signed by Spain and France on 2 May.{{sfn|Lesaffer}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map Peace of Aix la Chapelle (English).png|thumb|left|French gains by Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: Louis returned [[Cambrai]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]], but retained the rest]]\nFrance withdrew from Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, [[Armenti\u00e8res]], [[Bergues]] and [[Douai]] were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, [[Veurne]], [[Binche]], Charleroi and [[Ath]] made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=165}}\n\nFrom a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] began work on the defence line that became known as the ''Ceinture de fer''. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=31}} \n\nThe political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis' right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis' expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|1689 Grand Alliance]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=220}}\n\nThe part played by the Triple Alliance in the peace is still debated, but contemporaries believed it was crucial, and the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=163-167}} Concern over French ambitions revived the Orangist party, but political conflict with the Republican faction resulted in the deliberate neglect of Dutch land forces, viewed as bolstering the power of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]]; this would have catastrophic repercussions in 1672.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=312-316}}\n\nLouis launched the war because by 1663, he had come to believe the Dutch would never voluntarily agree the concessions he required. After 1668, he decided the best way to capture the Spanish Netherlands was to first defeat the Republic, and began planning the [[Franco-Dutch War]].{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last1=Afflerbach, Holger (ed)|first1=Strachan, Hew (ed)|title=How Fighting Ends: A History of Surrender| date=2012|publisher=OUP|isbn=978-0199693627|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719089964|ref=harv|edition=2013}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Clodfelter |first1=Micheal (sic) |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1494-2007 |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-0786433193 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=De P\u00e9rini |first1=Hard\u00ff |title=Batailles fran\u00e7aises, 1660-1700, Volume IV|date=1896 |publisher=Ernest Flammarion, Paris |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=El servicio de armas aragon\u00e9s durante el reinado de Carlos II: la defensa de Catalu\u00f1a, 1665-1697|journal=Revista de historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita|volume=72|year=1997|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=es Catalu\u00f1a durante el reinado de Carlos II : pol\u00edtica y guerra en la frontera catalana, 1679-1697]|year=1999|publisher=Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gooskens |first1=Frans |title=Sweden and the Treaty of Breda in 1667 \u2013 Swedish diplomats help to end naval warfare between the Dutch Republic and England |date=2016 |publisher=De Oranje-boom;

Under an obscure law known as the ''Jus Devolutionis'', [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] claimed these provinces 'devolved' to him by right of marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].\n\nThe French encountered minimal resistance but returned much of their gains in the May 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The terms had been agreed by Louis and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] in January 1668, reinforced by the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nAlthough the conflict was relatively minor, it marks the breaking point of the long alliance between France and the Dutch Republic and was the first of the wars of expansion fought by Louis that dominated Europe for the next 50 years.\n\n==Background==\nAs part of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] that ended the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|Franco-Spanish War]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] married [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the [[Spanish Empire]] remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by [[Kingdom of France|France]], Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold [[French \u00e9cu|\u00e9cus]], a huge sum that was never paid.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}}\n\nWhen [[Cardinal Mazarin]] died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=6}} [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], his Finance Minister, argued French economic growth required the [[Spanish Netherlands]], implying conflict with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], a long-term French ally. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] that confirmed Dutch independence also gave [[Amsterdam]] control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nBy 1663, Louis concluded the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions.{{sfn|Rowan|1954|p=3}} As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in July 1665, providing an excuse for their military build up; Louis also calculated this made it harder for the Dutch to oppose him.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=298}} In September, Philip died, leaving his four year old son [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] as king, and his widow [[Mariana of Austria]] as regent. If Charles died, Leopold would inherit the Spanish Empire.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311-312}}\n[[File:Detail of Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Autriche by Nocret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Theresa of Spain]], whose unpaid dowry was used to justify the war]]\nFrench lawyers argued as the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa's renunciation was invalid, and her rights \"devolved\" to Louis under the ''Jus Devolutionis'', an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], the towns of [[Cambrai]], Antwerp and [[Mechelen]], [[Upper Guelders]], the counties of [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and related possessions.{{sfn|Wolf|1962|p=316}} It was dismissed by Leopold and Mariana, since it applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights but gave Louis a legal justification.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=33-34}}\n\nAware of French intentions, Mariana's government sought to end the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], agree an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship. Louis countered with the 1667 [[Treaty of Lisbon (1667)|Treaty of Lisbon]], a ten year alliance with Portugal, and paid potential opponents like [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to remain neutral.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=36}} Leopold was occupied with the [[Great Turkish War]], while Foreign Minister [[Hugues de Lionne]] also extended the anti-Austrian [[League of the Rhine]] until 1668.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=95-96}}\n\nOn 8 May, every French ambassador in Europe read out a declaration, claiming Louis was taking possession of lands that rightfully belonged to him. In mid-May, talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War opened in [[Breda]] between the Republic, [[Denmark-Norway]], France and England; shortly before, [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] learned Louis and Charles had secretly agreed terms in advance, increasing the pressure on the Dutch not to oppose French aims.{{sfn|Gooskens|2016|p=69}}\n\nThe imminence of war ended Spain's reluctance to accept Portuguese sovereignty; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 23 May, granted England substantial commercial privileges, in return for help in ending the war with Portugal.{{sfn|Fisher, Savelle|1967|pp=66-70}}\n\n==War==\n===May to September 1667; the Spanish Netherlands===\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Spanish Netherlands, 1667 campaign; note modern Franco-Belgian boundary, blue lines indicate rivers|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Oudenaarde|pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 3|lon_min = 36\n|label3 =Antwerp |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 13|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 24\n|label4 =Tournai |pos4=right|lat4_deg=50|lat4_min = 36|lon4_deg = 3|lon4_min = 23\n|label5= Charleroi|pos5=bottom|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 24|lon5_deg = 4|lon5_min = 26\n|label6 = Lille  |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 3 |lon6_min = 03\n|label7= Namur|pos7 = right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 28| lon7_deg = 4|lon7_min = 52\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9 = M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min =46 | lon9_deg =4 | lon9_min = 43\n|label10 = Sierck|pos10 = bottom|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min =26 | lon10_deg =6 | lon10_min = 21\n|label11 = Kortrijk|pos11 = left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min=50|lon11_deg =3 | lon11_min = 16\n|label12 = Brussels|pos12 = right|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min=41|lon12_deg =4 | lon12_min = 21\n|label13 = Dendermonde|pos13 = left|lat13_deg=51|lat13_min=02|lon13_deg =4 | lon13_min = 06\n|label14 = Aalst|pos14 = right|lat14_deg=50|lat14_min=56|lon14_deg =4 |lon14_min = 02\n}}\nAlso referred to as [[Flanders]], the Spanish Netherlands was a compact area, dominated by canals and rivers. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water; campaigns in this theatre focused on control of strongpoints along rivers such as the [[Lys (river)|Lys]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Childs|1991|pp=32-33}}\n\nAfter 1659, a series of military reforms initiated by [[Michel Le Tellier]] made the French army more professional, while improving its logistic support.{{sfn|Rowlands|2010|p=147}} This allowed them to put larger numbers in the field, for longer periods; by 1667, the army had an authorised strength of 80,000, of whom 51,000 were deployed for the campaign.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=106}}\n\n[[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] was appointed supreme commander; his main force of 35,000 men and the artillery train were concentrated around [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], on the River Meuse. Another 9,000 under [[Aumont family|Antoine de Rochebaron]] prepared to advance up the Lys, via [[Kortrijk]] and [[Oudenaarde]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy|de Cr\u00e9quy]] and 6,000 light cavalry were based at [[Sierck-les-Bains]], securing their flank against an attack from Germany. Accompanied by Louis and his entourage, the French crossed the border on 24 May.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|pp=299-300}}\n\nAware of these preparations, Spanish governor [[Francisco de Moura, 3rd Marquis of Castel Rodrigo|Castel Rodrigo]] urgently requested additional funds from Madrid. Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million [[escudos]] on her daughter's wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp34-36}}\n\nAlthough insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.{{sfn|Afflerbach & Strachan|2012|p=159}}  \n[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Yser]] river, in [[Plain of Flanders|Maritime Flanders]]; a good example of the geography in this area]]\nTurenne's first objective was [[Charleroi]], a key Spanish supply base; Castel Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to [[Brussels]], first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, [[Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal|De Montal]] was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while [[Vauban]] began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured [[Tournai]], Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on [[Dendermonde]], intending to take Antwerp.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nOn 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castel Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt.

Ordered to cut off his retreat, [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds|Bellefonds]] and de Cr\u00e9quy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both [[List of Marshals of France#Louis XIV, 1643\u20131715|Marshals of France]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=303}} On 12 September, Turenne captured [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=304}}\n\n===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===\n[[File:Johan de Witt 1652.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]]; he had to persuade Louis to withdraw, while keeping him as an ally]]\nOn 31 July 1667, the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} This was driven by the [[States of Zeeland]], supported by [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]], English ambassador in [[the Hague]] and [[Brussels]], and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's representative in London.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|p=5}}\n\nDe Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; 'to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=111}} Although he and Charles preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador in Sweden]], Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.{{sfn|Rowan|1954|p=6}}\n\nFrom April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=155}} Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and the general populace.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=7}} In England, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[City of London Corporation|business]] wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]]; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the [[Secret Treaty of Dover|1670 Treaty of Dover]]{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}}   \n\nIn September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.{{sfn|Rowan|1954|p=4}} \n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], ca 1661]]\nWhen Philip died in 1665, Spain's only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] was deposed by his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]], who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|p=47}} The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Newitt|2004|p=228}}\n\nTo fund the 1668 campaign, Castel-Rodrigo agreed a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castel-Rodrigo [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=50-52}}\n\nOn 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September.{{sfn|Davenport, Paulin|1917|p=144,152}} The [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] was signed by England and the Republic on 23 January, the third member, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle.{{sfn|Davenport, Paullin|1917|p=166}} It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n\nRuvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=12}} Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent [[Franco-Dutch War]], Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the 'ungrateful Dutch nation', but his reaction at the time was far more moderate.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=23}} The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, 'the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money'.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=26}} Lionne also pointed out the Alliance's guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms 'without it costing us a sou.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=156}}\n\n===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comt\u00e9===\n{{Location map many|France Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9|caption = Modern department of Bourgogne (left) and Franche-Comt\u00e9 (right); key locations 1668 campaign |border = black|width =300|float = right|relief=yes|\n|label  = Besan\u00e7on   |pos = right|lat_deg =47|lat_min  = 14|lon_deg  = 6|lon_min = 1\n|label2 = Dole       |pos2 = right |lat2_deg=47|lat2_min = 05|lon2_deg = 5|lon2_min = 30\n|label3 = Gray       |pos3 = right |lat3_deg=47|lat3_min  =27|lon3_deg = 5|lon3_min = 36\n|label4 = Vesoul     |pos4 = right|lat4_deg=47|lat4_min  =37|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 10\n|label5 = Salins-les-Bains|pos5 = bottom|lat5_deg  =46|lat5_min  =57|lon5_deg  = 5|lon5_min = 53\n|label6  = Dijon     |pos6 = top |lat6_deg  =47|lat6_min=19|lon6_deg = 5|lon6_min = 01\n|label7  = Nevers    |pos7 = right  |lat7_deg  =47|lat7_min=00|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 10\n|label8  = Auxonne   |pos8 = left   |lat8_deg  =47|lat8_min  =12|lon8_deg  = 5|lon8_min = 23\n}}\nThroughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=112}}\n\nThe operation was commanded by the [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince de Cond\u00e9]]. Once France's leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comt\u00e9 was considered part of [[Burgundy]], his family's traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.{{sfn|Swann|2003|p=44}}\n\nTo keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans]] would attack [[Catalonia]], with Cond\u00e9 in the [[Three Bishoprics]] to deter an attack from Germany.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|pp=20-21}}\n\nThis provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in [[Dijon]]; by early February, Cond\u00e9 had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near [[Auxonne]]. He divided the army into two columns, the other led by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and entered Franche-Comt\u00e9 on 4 February.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} [[Free City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]] and [[Salins-les-Bains]] surrendered on 7 February, after which Cond\u00e9 and Luxembourg moved onto [[Dole, Jura|Dole]], where they were joined by Louis on 9 February. His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 to 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of [[Gray, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Gray]] on 19th; Louis was back in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] on 24th.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=306}}\n\n===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===\nOn the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the [[Gaspar T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 5th Duke de Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], [[Viceroy of Catalonia]], invaded the [[Upper Cerdanya]] with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1997|p=9}} Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local ''[[miquelets]]'' combined with the French military in resisting the invasion.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1999|p=266}} Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.{{sfn|Jan\u00e9 Checa|2003|p=454}}\n\n===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===\nThe French army remained the largest in Europe and Turenne, Cond\u00e9 and Orl\u00e9ans argued for war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. The biggest obstacle was French mercantile dependence on Dutch shipping, and Colbert initiated policies to eventually eliminate this.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=153-154}}\n\nIn February, Charles was reported as dangerously ill; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives peacefully under the Partition Treaty. On the other hand, France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, while [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] offered Spain 8,000 men, in addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=163}}\n\nOn 25 April, he decided on peace; the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms for ending the war. These were included in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], signed by Spain and France on 2 May.{{sfn|Lesaffer}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map Peace of Aix la Chapelle (English).png|thumb|left|French gains by Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: Louis returned [[Cambrai]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]], but retained the rest]]\nFrance withdrew from Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, [[Armenti\u00e8res]], [[Bergues]] and [[Douai]] were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, [[Veurne]], [[Binche]], Charleroi and [[Ath]] made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=165}}\n\nFrom a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] began work on the defence line that became known as the ''Ceinture de fer''. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=31}}  \n\nThe political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis' right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis' expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|1689 Grand Alliance]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=220}}\n\nThe part played by the Triple Alliance in the peace is still debated, but contemporaries believed it was crucial, and the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=163-167}} Concern over French ambitions revived the Orangist party, but political conflict with the Republican faction resulted in the deliberate neglect of Dutch land forces, viewed as bolstering the power of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]]; this would have catastrophic repercussions in 1672.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=312-316}}\n\nLouis launched the war because by 1663, he had come to believe the Dutch would never voluntarily agree the concessions he required. After 1668, he decided the best way to capture the Spanish Netherlands was to first defeat the Republic, and began planning the [[Franco-Dutch War]].{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last1=Afflerbach, Holger (ed)|first1=Strachan, Hew (ed)|title=How Fighting Ends: A History of Surrender| date=2012|publisher=OUP|isbn=978-0199693627|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719089964|ref=harv|edition=2013}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Clodfelter |first1=Micheal (sic) |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1494-2007 |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-0786433193 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=De P\u00e9rini |first1=Hard\u00ff |title=Batailles fran\u00e7aises, 1660-1700, Volume IV|date=1896 |publisher=Ernest Flammarion, Paris |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=El servicio de armas aragon\u00e9s durante el reinado de Carlos II: la defensa de Catalu\u00f1a, 1665-1697|journal=Revista de historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita|volume=72|year=1997|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=es Catalu\u00f1a durante el reinado de Carlos II : pol\u00edtica y guerra en la frontera catalana, 1679-1697]|year=1999|publisher=Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gooskens |first1=Frans |title=Sweden and the Treaty of Breda in 1667 \u2013 Swedish diplomats help to end naval warfare between the Dutch Republic and England |date=2016 |publisher=De Oranje-boom;
