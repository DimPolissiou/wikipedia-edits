It serves as base for [[Binter Canarias]], [[Canaryfly]], [[Ryanair]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] and [[Vueling]]. Other airlines use it as a base to operate charter flights to Cape Verde and Gambia ([[TUI fly Deutschland]] and [[TUI fly Nordic]]), but only in the winter.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nIn 1919, Frenchman Pierre George Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re was granted clearance from the French & Spanish governments to establish an airline route between Toulouse and Casablanca. This also included stopovers in [[M\u00e1laga Airport|M\u00e1laga]], [[Alicante Airport|Alicante]] and [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]]. The airport opened on 7 April 1930, after [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] signed a royal order announcing that the military air force installations on the Bay of Gando would become a civilian airfield. In its existence, the airport has become the largest gateway into the [[Canary Islands]], as well as the largest in terms of passenger and cargo operations.\n\nIn 1946, the old passenger terminal opened, which took two years to build.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=LPA&c=Page&cid=1048858940216&pagename=subHome|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307121543/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=LPA&c=Page&cid=1048858940216&pagename=subHome|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 March 2012|title=Page not found- Aena.es - Aena-Aeropuertos.es|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> In 1948 a runway was built, which was completed and fully tarmacked in 1957.\n\nIn 1963, improvements to the airport were made. This included new parking spaces, enlargement of the terminal and the provision of a [[Visual approach slope indicator|visual approach slope indicator system]]. In 1964, a transmission station was built. In 1966 a new control tower was completed, replacing the old control tower that was constructed in 1946. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1970, work began on the current passenger terminal which opened in March 1973. During this time, a second runway was being built and this was completed in 1980. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn 18 February 1988, [[Binter Canarias]] announced that the airline's main base was to be established at Gran Canaria. The base opened on 26 March 1989. In October 1991, the terminal was enlarged with improved facilities so it could handle more passengers.\n\nIn December 2010, low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] announced the opening of 3 new bases on the Canary Islands. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In addition to Gran Canaria these include [[Lanzarote Airport|Lanzarote]] and [[Tenerife South Airport|Tenerife South]]. Ryanair presently operates 30 routes from Gran Canaria. The airport was an official alternative (emergency) landing site for the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]], before the ending of the Space Shuttle programme in July 2011.\n\nAs of 2011, there was a programme to expand the airport, extending the terminal and creating a new runway.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331115426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |date=March 31, 2016 }}. Globalsecurity.org (2011-07-21). Retrieved on 2011-08-02.</ref> In 2015 this major renovation of Gran Canaria airport was completed. Among the improvements was increasing the number of baggage belts, 16 to 24, check-in counters from 96 to 132 and gates, up to 40. The new terminal area is now fully active, doubling the previous area. There is also a plan for the building of a new runway for the airport.\n\n==Terminal==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe airport has one terminal which opened in March 1973. It was later extended in October 1991 to increase passenger traffic. Despite being a building of historical interest, in 2013 the original passenger terminal building, opened in 1946, was demolished to make way for a further extension which opened in 2014.  Although dramatically expanded over the years the airport remains a single terminal airport.\n\nThere are four check-in areas. Check-in Area 1 (desks 101 to 118) is in the newest part of the airport (which opened on 16 July 2014) and serves almost exclusively flights operated by [[CanaryFly]], [[Air Europa]] and [[Binter Canarias]] (mainly inter-island flights between the [[Canary Islands]] or to [[Morocco]]).  At times of very high demand, check-in Area 1 may provide overflow capacity for Areas 2, 3 and 4.  Check-in Area 2 (desks 201 to 234) is located in the first part of the \"new\" airport which opened in 1973. This area was completely refurbished in 2014 and is normally used for flights handled by Iberia plus some of those handled by Ground Force (Globalia Handling). Check-in Area 3 (desks 301 to 352) is in the second part of the \"new\" airport which originally opened in 1991 and is used for flights handled by Ground Force.  Additionally, airline [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] have dedicated check-in desks and self-check-in podiums located to the southern end of Area 3.  Check-in Area 4 (desks 401 to 406) is located downstairs between the police station and the main car rental offices ([[Hertz]], [[Europcar]], CICAR, [http://www.topcar.es TopCar] , Gold Car and [[Avis Rent a Car System]]) and is used exclusively by [[Ryanair]].\n\nThere are two security filters where passengers pass from the general public areas into the departures area. At these security filters passengers and their hand luggage is scanned to ensure no prohibited items pass. The main security filter is located between Check-in Areas 2 and 3. There is a second filter located in Check-in Area 1 which is intended to serve exclusively passengers of inter-island flights.\n\nThe terminal departures area is split into four zones (A, B, C, and D). Zone A is for flights to the other Canary Islands, Zones B and C are for European Union (including Spain), Switzerland, Iceland, and Scandinavian flights and Zone D is for other international flights. The gates in Zone A are at ground floor level to the Northern end of the terminal. Other gates are on the first floor (the same level as the security filters into departures) those in Zone D featuring additional security to allow for the screening of international passengers.\n\nThere are two arrivals areas numbered \"1\" and \"2\" both located downstairs at ground level. Area 1 serves all arrivals of flights originating within Spain and is located to the Northern end of the airport.  Some of the car rental companies have additional counters in this area as it is a considerable walk to the main car rental area. Area 2 serves all international arrivals and is located to the Southern end of the airport. As the majority of arrivals served by area 2 are for tourist flights, many bringing passengers travelling on package holidays organized by tour operators, there is a large coach park (Parking A) located immediately in front of this area.  Overflow coach parking (which is required only in the Winter months) is provided at the departures level (Parking B) and is accessed from arrivals area 2 via a purpose-built a pedestrian tunnel with stairs and travelators.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aer Lingus]] | [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Cork Airport|Cork]]\n<!--

There are special bus service from most towns in Gran Canaria, but access by taxi is usual.\n\nGran Canaria's main motorway [[GC1 (Gran Canaria)|GC1]] runs past the airport providing transport links to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the North and to the tourist resorts in the South.\n\nPlans have existed for several years to construct a rail link connecting the airport to Las Palmas and Maspalomas. The [[Tren de Gran Canaria]] scheme, estimated to cost \u20ac1,500 million, has not been confirmed due to funding problems.<ref name=\"canarias7-0918\">{{cite news |title=Al tren 'solo' le faltan 1.500 millones |url=https://www.canarias7.es/siete-islas/gran-canaria/al-tren-solo-le-faltan-1-500-millones-JC5501487 |accessdate=16 November 2018 |work=canarias7.es |date=16 September 2018 |language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\n==Military use==\nThere is an airbase of the [[Spanish Air Force]] to the east of the runways. Beyond several hangars opposite to the passenger terminal, the Gando Air Base (''Base A\u00e9rea de Gando'') contains ten shelters situated on the southern end of the eastern runway. They harbor the ''Ala 46'' with [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s, [[CASA 212]] and the [[Eurocopter AS 532]] of SAR .<ref>Ya\u00f1ez and Rodriguez 2008, p. 23.</ref> ''Ala 46'' or 46 Wing, composed of 462 and 802 fighter squadron, defends the Spanish airspace around the Canary Islands. It is one of the biggest and most important air bases of the Spanish Air Force and is unique for the wide variety of aircraft which it operates.\n\nMilitary activity was most intense during the mid 1970s, at the time of the crisis of decolonisation of Western Sahara and its occupation by Morocco. Military crises in Western Africa, like the 2013 Mali intervention by France, made Gando Air Base the main air platform for operations in Western Africa area by NATO. In 2006 Spain proposed Gando Air Base as headquarters for the newly created US Africa Command (AFRICOM), but the AFRICOM HQ was ultimately based in Stuttgart (Germany).\n\nThe ''Canary Islands Air Command'' (''Mando A\u00e9reo de Canarias'' \u2013 ''MACAN'') is based in the city of Las Palmas. Canary Islands Air Command is the only territorial general Air Command Air Force in Spain; its mission is the maintenance, preparation and command of air units located in the Canary archipelago.<ref>Orden DEF/1575/2007, de 28 de mayo, por la que se establecen las Comandancias Militares A\u00e9reas de Aeropuerto y se fijan sus dependencias.</ref><ref>*[http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag P\u00e1gina del Ministerio del Aire de Espa\u00f1a] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522025031/http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag |date=May 22, 2016 }}</ref> Any Spanish military airplane that lands in the Canary Islands is immediately put at the disposal of the Canary Islands Air Command, who can retain it and use it as long as necessary for missions within the islands. This happens sometimes with heavy military transport, antisubmarine warfare and early warning airplanes; the islands do not have these on a permanent basis. Once the plane is released by the Canary Islands Air Command, it can leave the Canary Islands and reverts to the Air Force Commands of mainland Spain.\n\nThe deployment base of Gando Air Base is the Lanzarote Military Airfield (Aer\u00f3dromo Militar de Lanzarote). Lanzarote Military Airfield has permanently its own Air Force troops platoons and the radar for the air defence (the EVA 22, which covers the Eastern Canary Islands and the maritime area up to the Sahara), but it has no permanently based military planes, using the ones from Gando.\n\n==Other facilities==\n[[Canaryfly]] has its head office in Hangar L.<ref>\"[https://www.canaryfly.es/aviso-legal Aviso legal].\" [[Canaryfly]].

It serves as base for [[Binter Canarias]], [[Canaryfly]], [[Ryanair]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] and [[Vueling]]. Other airlines use it as a base to operate charter flights to Cape Verde and Gambia ([[TUI fly Deutschland]] and [[TUI fly Nordic]]), but only in the winter.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nIn 1919, Frenchman Pierre George Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re was granted clearance from the French & Spanish governments to establish an airline route between Toulouse and Casablanca. This also included stopovers in [[M\u00e1laga Airport|M\u00e1laga]], [[Alicante Airport|Alicante]] and [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]]. The airport opened on 7 April 1930, after [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] signed a royal order announcing that the military air force installations on the Bay of Gando would become a civilian airfield. In its existence, the airport has become the largest gateway into the [[Canary Islands]], as well as the largest in terms of passenger and cargo operations.\n\nIn 1946, the old passenger terminal opened, which took two years to build.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=LPA&c=Page&cid=1048858940216&pagename=subHome|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307121543/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=EN_GB&SiteName=LPA&c=Page&cid=1048858940216&pagename=subHome|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 March 2012|title=Page not found- Aena.es - Aena-Aeropuertos.es|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> In 1948 a runway was built, which was completed and fully tarmacked in 1957.\n\nIn 1963, improvements to the airport were made. This included new parking spaces, enlargement of the terminal and the provision of a [[Visual approach slope indicator|visual approach slope indicator system]]. In 1964, a transmission station was built. In 1966 a new control tower was completed, replacing the old control tower that was constructed in 1946. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1970, work began on the current passenger terminal which opened in March 1973. During this time, a second runway was being built and this was completed in 1980. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn 18 February 1988, [[Binter Canarias]] announced that the airline's main base was to be established at Gran Canaria. The base opened on 26 March 1989. In October 1991, the terminal was enlarged with improved facilities so it could handle more passengers.\n\nIn December 2010, low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] announced the opening of 3 new bases on the Canary Islands. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} In addition to Gran Canaria these include [[Lanzarote Airport|Lanzarote]] and [[Tenerife South Airport|Tenerife South]]. Ryanair presently operates 30 routes from Gran Canaria. The airport was an official alternative (emergency) landing site for the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]], before the ending of the Space Shuttle programme in July 2011.\n\nAs of 2011, there was a programme to expand the airport, extending the terminal and creating a new runway.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331115426/http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |date=March 31, 2016 }}. Globalsecurity.org (2011-07-21). Retrieved on 2011-08-02.</ref> In 2015 this major renovation of Gran Canaria airport was completed. Among the improvements was increasing the number of baggage belts, 16 to 24, check-in counters from 96 to 132 and gates, up to 40. The new terminal area is now fully active, doubling the previous area. There is also a plan for the building of a new runway for the airport.\n\n==Terminal==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe airport has one terminal which opened in March 1973. It was later extended in October 1991 to increase passenger traffic. Despite being a building of historical interest, in 2013 the original passenger terminal building, opened in 1946, was demolished to make way for a further extension which opened in 2014.  Although dramatically expanded over the years the airport remains a single terminal airport.\n\nThere are four check-in areas. Check-in Area 1 (desks 101 to 118) is in the newest part of the airport (which opened on 16 July 2014) and serves almost exclusively flights operated by [[CanaryFly]], [[Air Europa]] and [[Binter Canarias]] (mainly inter-island flights between the [[Canary Islands]] or to [[Morocco]]).  At times of very high demand, check-in Area 1 may provide overflow capacity for Areas 2, 3 and 4.  Check-in Area 2 (desks 201 to 234) is located in the first part of the \"new\" airport which opened in 1973. This area was completely refurbished in 2014 and is normally used for flights handled by Iberia plus some of those handled by Ground Force (Globalia Handling). Check-in Area 3 (desks 301 to 352) is in the second part of the \"new\" airport which originally opened in 1991 and is used for flights handled by Ground Force.  Additionally, airline [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] have dedicated check-in desks and self-check-in podiums located to the southern end of Area 3.  Check-in Area 4 (desks 401 to 406) is located downstairs between the police station and the main car rental offices ([[Hertz]], [[Europcar]], CICAR, [http://www.topcar.es TopCar] , Gold Car and [[Avis Rent a Car System]]) and is used exclusively by [[Ryanair]].\n\nThere are two security filters where passengers pass from the general public areas into the departures area. At these security filters passengers and their hand luggage is scanned to ensure no prohibited items pass. The main security filter is located between Check-in Areas 2 and 3. There is a second filter located in Check-in Area 1 which is intended to serve exclusively passengers of inter-island flights.\n\nThe terminal departures area is split into four zones (A, B, C, and D). Zone A is for flights to the other Canary Islands, Zones B and C are for European Union (including Spain), Switzerland, Iceland, and Scandinavian flights and Zone D is for other international flights. The gates in Zone A are at ground floor level to the Northern end of the terminal. Other gates are on the first floor (the same level as the security filters into departures) those in Zone D featuring additional security to allow for the screening of international passengers.\n\nThere are two arrivals areas numbered \"1\" and \"2\" both located downstairs at ground level. Area 1 serves all arrivals of flights originating within Spain and is located to the Northern end of the airport.  Some of the car rental companies have additional counters in this area as it is a considerable walk to the main car rental area. Area 2 serves all international arrivals and is located to the Southern end of the airport. As the majority of arrivals served by area 2 are for tourist flights, many bringing passengers travelling on package holidays organized by tour operators, there is a large coach park (Parking A) located immediately in front of this area.  Overflow coach parking (which is required only in the Winter months) is provided at the departures level (Parking B) and is accessed from arrivals area 2 via a purpose-built a pedestrian tunnel with stairs and travelators.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aer Lingus]] | [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Cork Airport|Cork]]\n<!--

There are special bus service from most towns in Gran Canaria, but access by taxi is usual.\n\nGran Canaria's main motorway [[GC1 (Gran Canaria)|GC1]] runs past the airport providing transport links to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in the North and to the tourist resorts in the South.\n\nPlans have existed for several years to construct a rail link connecting the airport to Las Palmas and Maspalomas. The [[Tren de Gran Canaria]] scheme, estimated to cost \u20ac1,500 million, has not been confirmed due to funding problems.<ref name=\"canarias7-0918\">{{cite news |title=Al tren 'solo' le faltan 1.500 millones |url=https://www.canarias7.es/siete-islas/gran-canaria/al-tren-solo-le-faltan-1-500-millones-JC5501487 |accessdate=16 November 2018 |work=canarias7.es |date=16 September 2018 |language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\n==Military use==\nThere is an airbase of the [[Spanish Air Force]] to the east of the runways. Beyond several hangars opposite to the passenger terminal, the Gando Air Base (''Base A\u00e9rea de Gando'') contains ten shelters situated on the southern end of the eastern runway. They harbor the ''Ala 46'' with [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s, [[CASA 212]] and the [[Eurocopter AS 532]] of SAR .<ref>Ya\u00f1ez and Rodriguez 2008, p. 23.</ref> ''Ala 46'' or 46 Wing, composed of 462 and 802 fighter squadron, defends the Spanish airspace around the Canary Islands. It is one of the biggest and most important air bases of the Spanish Air Force and is unique for the wide variety of aircraft which it operates.\n\nMilitary activity was most intense during the mid 1970s, at the time of the crisis of decolonisation of Western Sahara and its occupation by Morocco. Military crises in Western Africa, like the 2013 Mali intervention by France, made Gando Air Base the main air platform for operations in Western Africa area by NATO. In 2006 Spain proposed Gando Air Base as headquarters for the newly created US Africa Command (AFRICOM), but the AFRICOM HQ was ultimately based in Stuttgart (Germany).\n\nThe ''Canary Islands Air Command'' (''Mando A\u00e9reo de Canarias'' \u2013 ''MACAN'') is based in the city of Las Palmas. Canary Islands Air Command is the only territorial general Air Command Air Force in Spain; its mission is the maintenance, preparation and command of air units located in the Canary archipelago.<ref>Orden DEF/1575/2007, de 28 de mayo, por la que se establecen las Comandancias Militares A\u00e9reas de Aeropuerto y se fijan sus dependencias.</ref><ref>*[http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag P\u00e1gina del Ministerio del Aire de Espa\u00f1a] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522025031/http://www.ejercitodelaire.mde.es/ea/pag |date=May 22, 2016 }}</ref> Any Spanish military airplane that lands in the Canary Islands is immediately put at the disposal of the Canary Islands Air Command, who can retain it and use it as long as necessary for missions within the islands. This happens sometimes with heavy military transport, antisubmarine warfare and early warning airplanes; the islands do not have these on a permanent basis. Once the plane is released by the Canary Islands Air Command, it can leave the Canary Islands and reverts to the Air Force Commands of mainland Spain.\n\nThe deployment base of Gando Air Base is the Lanzarote Military Airfield (Aer\u00f3dromo Militar de Lanzarote). Lanzarote Military Airfield has permanently its own Air Force troops platoons and the radar for the air defence (the EVA 22, which covers the Eastern Canary Islands and the maritime area up to the Sahara), but it has no permanently based military planes, using the ones from Gando.\n\n==Other facilities==\n[[Canaryfly]] has its head office in Hangar L.<ref>\"[https://www.canaryfly.es/aviso-legal Aviso legal].\" [[Canaryfly]].

During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern \"Rebel\" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the \"Rebels\" moniker remains to this day.

SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that are used to flush toilets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |title=Features &#124; Science and Engineering Building &#124; University of Nevada, Las Vegas |publisher=Unlv.edu |accessdate=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026012640/http://www.unlv.edu/seb/features |archive-date=2013-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Greenspun College of Urban Affairs building of UNLV received a LEED Gold rating in April 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |title=USGBC Nevada - LEED in Nevada |publisher=Usgbcnv.org |accessdate=2013-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207161138/http://usgbcnv.org/leed-in-nevada |archivedate=2013-12-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, UNLV received the Cashman Good Government Award for the campus' sustainability measures for \"maintaining consistent energy costs despite substantial campus growth,\" saving nearly $11 million from 2001-2009.

The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exceptions are the UNLV men's soccer team and swim and dive team, which compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].\n\nThe school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to 1958, when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned-down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting.

During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern \"Rebel\" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the \"Rebels\" moniker remains to this day. Since its founding, the university has grown rapidly, expanding both its academic programs and campus facilities.\n\nIn 1969, the board of regents approved the name University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the abbreviation UNLV.<ref name=timeline />\n\nIn 1973, [[Jerry Tarkanian]] was hired as the men's basketball coach by UNLV's second president, Roman Zorn.<ref name=zorn>{{cite news|title=UNLV\u2019s pioneering second president, Zorn, dies at 85 |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/aug/20/unlvs-pioneering-second-president-zorn-dies-at-85/|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=20 August 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe Center for Business and Economic Research <!-- (CBER) -->  was established in 1975 for research projects that assist in the development of the Nevada economy and assist state and local agencies and private-sector enterprises in the collection and analysis of economic and market data.\n\nIn 1981, [[Claes Oldenburg]]'s Flashlight sculpture was installed on the plaza between Artemus Ham Hall and Judy Bayley Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Arin|first=Naomi|title=High beam: Using a flashlight to illuminate the public art struggles of \u2018Paintbrushes\u2019|url=http://vegasseven.com/2011/03/17/high-beam/|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=Vegas Seven|date=17 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Lied Institute for Real Estate Studies was established in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBER|url=http://www.unlv.edu/business/cber|website=www.unlv.edu|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, The School of Dental Medicine opened to train students, and to offer low-cost dental care to residents.

SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%.

The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exceptions are the UNLV men's soccer team and swim and dive team, which compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].\n\nThe school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to 1958, when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned-down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting. No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials.\n\nUNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year, the men's football team plays the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] in a football game called the Battle for Nevada. The trophy for that game is the [[Fremont Cannon]]. Built by the [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott Copper]] Corp., Nevada Mines Division, the cannon is valued at more than $10,000 and is considered one of the best and loudest, symbols of rivalry in college football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |title=UNLV Official Athletic Site - Traditions |publisher=Unlvrebels.cstv.com |accessdate=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923160200/http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |archive-date=2013-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> UNLV trails Nevada in the series 17\u201327 after winning the 2018 game at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Whitney, Nevada|Whitney]] by 34 to 29.\n\nUNLV is most known for its men's basketball program.

They timed their statements to coincide with their resignations from responsible positions in [[General Electric]]'s nuclear energy division, and later established themselves as consultants on the nuclear power industry for state governments, federal agencies, and overseas governments. The consulting firm they formed, MHB Technical Associates, was technical advisor for the movie, \"[[The China Syndrome]].\" The three engineers participated in Congressional hearings which their disclosures precipitated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918045,00.html|title=Environment: The San Jose Three|date=16 February 1976|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879643,00.html|title=Environment: The Struggle over Nuclear Power|date=8 March 1976|work=TIME.com|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Browns Ferry Unit 1 under construction.jpg|thumb|Browns Ferry Unit 1 under construction]]\n\n[[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant|Browns Ferry nuclear power plant]] construction began in 1966. It was located in Alabama and in 1967 it earned a federal construction permit. The plant received new design standards which call for \"physical separation of electrical cables.\" <ref>Weil, Vivian. \"Moral Responsibility and Whistleblowing in the Nuclear Industry: Browns Ferry and Three Mile Island.\" (1983).</ref> There was an issue with the instructions on how to accomplish this so the AEC inspector F.U. Bower requested that the AEC elaborate; however, there was no response from the organization and installation went on. Still, no instructions were issued after five failed inspections in 1970. The lack of cable separation instructions led to the sacrifice of safety coolant systems in two of the units in order to improve one with severe safety violation. The ignorance of the AEC led to the fire that occurred on 22 March 1975, that almost led to a radiation leak. The substance separating the wires caught fire when tests to find air leaks with a candle ignited it thus resulting in damage to the control systems. With damage to the control systems, the cooling system that keeps the units from leaking radiation did not work properly. Somehow the situation was avoided and the units were put out of service. Throughout the occurrence of these events Bridenbaugh had been discussing his reservations on the safety at the plant in vain and in 1976 a year later Bridenbaugh, Hubbard and Minor resigned.\n\n==Crystal River 3 and Lou Putney==\n{{Main|Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant}}\n\nLou Putney came on the scene of the [[Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant|Crystal River 3]] plant after receiving a call from a plant engineer. The engineer claimed that the managers hired engineers based on \"good ol' boy mentality.\"<ref name=\":3\">Riggs, Stephanie. \"FLORIDA POWER AND THE CRYSTAL RIVER NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.\" (1997).</ref> The plant had experience numerous shut downs since 1978. Along with this concern, the engineer was not confident that the manager possessed the qualifications to be a manager. Although the engineer pursued nothing further with his complaint, it prompted Putney to purchase shares of stock in the company that would allow him to file \"[[shareholder resolution]]s.\" Putney had looked into the nuclear reactors that were built of an unsafe material for emergency cooling procedures. The NRC had placed Crystal River on the top 14 worst reactors list because of this. So, the shares were purchased in 1981, which is when Putney filed his first shareholder resolution requesting the plant be shut down. This tradition was upheld by Putney for seven years until he was required to purchase more stock in order to continue filing resolutions. Over the course of sixteen years, Putney filed a total of fourteen shareholder resolutions. All of these resolutions were ignored and were met with offers to buy out his shares so he could no longer file the resolutions.<ref name=\":3\" /> The plant was officially decommissioned in September 2009.\n\n==Ronald Goldstein==\nRonald J. Goldstein was a supervisor employed by [[Electric Bond and Share Company|EBASCO]], which was a major contractor for the construction of the South Texas plants. In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant.\n\nSAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Golstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zuniga|first1=Sonia|title=20 memorable whistleblowers in the U.S.|url=https://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/slideshow/20-memorable-whistleblowers-in-the-U-S-128656/photo-9901160.php|accessdate=18 September 2016|agency=Houston Chronicle|date=26 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary [[Lynn Morley Martin|Lynn Martin]]. The ruling was appealed and overturned by the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers. After Goldstein lost his case, Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers.<ref name=\"Whistleblower's Handbook\">{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=Stephen Martin|title=The Whistleblower's Handbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Doing What's Right and Protecting Yourself|year=2011|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=9780762774791|pages=116\u201318}}</ref>\n\n==Fernald Nuclear Incidents==\n[[File:Fernald Production-era Aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Fernald Feed Materials Production Center]]\n[[File:HD.6D.724 (13452891054).jpg|thumb|Uranium components fabricated at Fernald]]\n\n{{Main|Fernald Feed Materials Production Center}}\n\nThe Fernald Feed Materials Production Center was built in Crosby Township, Ohio in 1951, and decommissioned in 1989.

It was located in Alabama and in 1967 it earned a federal construction permit. The plant received new design standards which call for \"physical separation of electrical cables.\" <ref>Weil, Vivian. \"Moral Responsibility and Whistleblowing in the Nuclear Industry: Browns Ferry and Three Mile Island.\" (1983).</ref> There was an issue with the instructions on how to accomplish this so the AEC inspector F.U. Bower requested that the AEC elaborate; however, there was no response from the organization and installation went on. Still, no instructions were issued after five failed inspections in 1970. The lack of cable separation instructions led to the sacrifice of safety coolant systems in two of the units in order to improve one with severe safety violation. The ignorance of the AEC led to the fire that occurred on 22 March 1975, that almost led to a radiation leak. The substance separating the wires caught fire when tests to find air leaks with a candle ignited it thus resulting in damage to the control systems. With damage to the control systems, the cooling system that keeps the units from leaking radiation did not work properly. Somehow the situation was avoided and the units were put out of service. Throughout the occurrence of these events Bridenbaugh had been discussing his reservations on the safety at the plant in vain and in 1976 a year later Bridenbaugh, Hubbard and Minor resigned.\n\n==Crystal River 3 and Lou Putney==\n{{Main|Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant}}\n\nLou Putney came on the scene of the [[Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant|Crystal River 3]] plant after receiving a call from a plant engineer. The engineer claimed that the managers hired engineers based on \"good ol' boy mentality.\"<ref name=\":3\">Riggs, Stephanie. \"FLORIDA POWER AND THE CRYSTAL RIVER NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.\" (1997).</ref> The plant had experience numerous shut downs since 1978. Along with this concern, the engineer was not confident that the manager possessed the qualifications to be a manager. Although the engineer pursued nothing further with his complaint, it prompted Putney to purchase shares of stock in the company that would allow him to file \"[[shareholder resolution]]s.\" Putney had looked into the nuclear reactors that were built of an unsafe material for emergency cooling procedures. The NRC had placed Crystal River on the top 14 worst reactors list because of this. So, the shares were purchased in 1981, which is when Putney filed his first shareholder resolution requesting the plant be shut down. This tradition was upheld by Putney for seven years until he was required to purchase more stock in order to continue filing resolutions. Over the course of sixteen years, Putney filed a total of fourteen shareholder resolutions. All of these resolutions were ignored and were met with offers to buy out his shares so he could no longer file the resolutions.<ref name=\":3\" /> The plant was officially decommissioned in September 2009.\n\n==Ronald Goldstein==\nRonald J. Goldstein was a supervisor employed by [[Electric Bond and Share Company|EBASCO]], which was a major contractor for the construction of the South Texas plants. In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant.\n\nSAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Golstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zuniga|first1=Sonia|title=20 memorable whistleblowers in the U.S.|url=https://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/slideshow/20-memorable-whistleblowers-in-the-U-S-128656/photo-9901160.php|accessdate=18 September 2016|agency=Houston Chronicle|date=26 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary [[Lynn Morley Martin|Lynn Martin]].

The town is in a very strategic location, as it lies just 4&nbsp;km south from the [[Semalka Border Crossing]] with [[Syria]] as well as being close to the border with Turkey.\n\n\nIn 1913 there were approximately 1,300 Catholics living in Faysh Khabur.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe town has been connected with the [[Sassanian]] city \"Peroz-Shapur\", and the modern name is thought to be influenced by the Persian one.

The first was during the [[Simele Massacre]] in August 1933, when hundreds of its [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] inhabitants were attacked by the [[Iraqi Army]]. The second time the village was targeted was during the [[First Kurdish\u2013Iraqi War|first Kurdish rebellion]] in 1961 by the Sindi Kurdish tribe, which forced the inhabitants to seek refuge in [[Al-Khalidiyah, al-Hasakah Governorate|Khanik]], the sister village of Faysh Khabur across the border in [[Syria]], until 1975 when they returned.

A place in this influential network would prove crucial to Cromwell's military and political career.

His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morrill, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the [[Huntingdonshire]] [[county town]] of [[Huntingdon]]. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including ''valde melancholicus'' (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]]. In 1629 he was caught up in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1630.<ref>Morrill, pp.&nbsp;24\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell's House]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]\n\nIn 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon\u2014probably as a result of the dispute\u2014and moved to a farmstead in nearby [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] (then in Huntingdonshire, now in Cambridgeshire). This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact. A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening. The letter outlines how, having been \"the chief of sinners\", Cromwell had been called to be among \"the congregation of the firstborn\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> It would appear that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to [[Connecticut]] in America, but was prevented by the government from leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml|title=A unique leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around \u00a3300\u2013400 per year;<ref>Gaunt, p.34.</ref> by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]].<ref name=bcw>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/oliver-cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament: 1628\u201329 and 1640\u20131642==\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628\u20131629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received.<ref>Morrill, pp.25\u201326.</ref> After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973</ref>\n\nA second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628\u201329, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a Puritan [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]].<ref>Adamson, John (1990). \"Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament\", in Morrill, p. 57.</ref> At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]].<ref>Adamson, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Military commander: 1642\u20131646==\n\n===English Civil War begins===\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the [[English Civil War]]. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in [[East Anglia]] in 1643, notably at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lincolnshire.htm#gainsborough |title=1643: Civil War in Lincolnshire |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}</ref> He was subsequently appointed governor of the [[Isle of Ely]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elystandard.co.uk/ely-life/fenland-riots-as-country-slides-into-civil-war-1-258647|title=Fenland riots|website=www.elystandard.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> and a [[colonel]] in the Eastern Association.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n=== Marston Moor 1644 ===\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] of horse in Manchester's army. The success of his cavalry in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment during the battle but returning to help force the victory.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], London 1973, {{ISBN|0297765566}}, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], pp. 120\u2013129.</ref> After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor he wrote a famous letter to his [[Valentine Walton|brother-in-law]].

Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of \"low birth\" as officers in the army, to which he replied: \"If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them&nbsp;... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else\".<ref>Letter to Sir William Spring, September 1643, quoted in Carlyle, Thomas (ed.)

This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command. All of them\u2014except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament\u2014chose to renounce their military positions. The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms. In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Battle of Naseby 1645===\n[[File:Charles Landseer Cromwell Battle of Naseby.JPG|thumb|Cromwell in the Battle of Naseby in 1645. [[Charles Landseer]].]]\nAt the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender.<ref>Kenyon, John & Ohlmeyer, Jane (eds.) (2000). ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland, and Ireland 1638\u20131660'' (Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|0-19-280278-X}}, p.141</ref> Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at [[Bridgwater]], [[Sherborne]], Bristol, [[Devizes]], and [[Winchester]], then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June 1646.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Cromwell's military style===\nCromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.<ref>[[Austin Herbert Woolrych|Woolrych, Austin]] (1990). ''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp.117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nCromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-76556-6}}, pp. 154\u2013161</ref>\n\n==Politics: 1647\u20131649==\nIn February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/news/a-lasting-place-in-history-1-377880|title=A lasting place in history|publisher=Saffron Walden Reporter|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the \"[[Heads of Proposals]]\" pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Maurice|title=The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell|year=1957|publisher=Collier- Macmillan LTD.|location=London|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> It was designed to check the powers of the [[executive branch|executive]], to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] settlement.<ref>Although there is debate over whether Cromwell and Ireton were the authors of the Heads of Proposals or acting on behalf of Saye and Sele: Adamson, John (1987). \"The English Nobility and the Projected Settlement of 1647\", in ''Historical Journal'', 30, 3; Kishlansky, Mark (1990). \"Saye What?\" in ''Historical Journal'' 33, 4.</ref>\n\nMany in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other. The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1987).

If you move it down, it breaks the line into the next topic.--->\n\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the [[Second English Civil War]] in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms. Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]. The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning. The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks. Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|title=Spartacus: Rowland Laugharne at Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025014050/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|archivedate=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nCromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England. At [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Preston]], Cromwell, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, won a decisive victory against an army twice as large.<ref>Gardiner (1901), pp.144\u201347; Gaunt (1997) 94\u201397.</ref>\n\nDuring 1648, Cromwell's letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that \"they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land\". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod.<ref>Morrill and Baker (2008), p.31.</ref> These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument.<ref>Adamson, pp.76\u201384.</ref> The episode shows Cromwell's firm belief in \"[[Providentialism]]\"\u2014that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of \"chosen people\" (whom God had \"provided\" for such purposes). Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction.<ref>Jendrysik, p. 79</ref>\n\n===King tried and executed===\n{{main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|Execution of Charles I}}\nIn December 1648, in an episode that became known as [[Pride's Purge]], a troop of soldiers headed by Colonel [[Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from the [[Long Parliament]] all those who were not supporters of the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the New Model Army and the Independents.<ref>Macaulay, p. 68</ref> Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the [[Rump Parliament]], agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars.<ref name=bcw/> Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (\"The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\").<ref>Coward 1991, p. 65</ref>\n\nThe death warrant for Charles was eventually signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who was the third to sign it).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/collections/deathwarrant/|title=Death Warrant of King Charles I|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the King, or \"[[regicide]]\", was controversial, if for no other reason due to the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107021024/http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2015|title=Oliver Cromwell Destroys the \"Divine Right of Kings\"|first=Ben|last=Hart|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: \"None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who stooped to sign it.

In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as \"[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]\". In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the \"[[New Model Army]]\". The \"[[Leveller]]\" or \"[[Agitator]]\" movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto \"[[Agreement of the People]]\" in 1647. Cromwell and the rest of the \"[[Grandees]]\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners. In the \"[[Putney Debates]]\" of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad. The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm |title=The Levellers |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish campaign: 1649\u201350==\n{{See also|Irish Confederate Wars|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649&ndash;50. Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\".<ref>Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000). ''Confederate Catholics at War'' ([[Cork University Press]]), {{ISBN|1-85918-244-5}}, p.115.</ref>\n\nCromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of [[Pope|papal]] and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in [[continental Europe]].<ref>Fraser, pp.74\u201376.</ref> Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (\"Gaels\")]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.326\u2013328.</ref>\n\nParliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England. At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture\u2014comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.98.</ref> Cromwell wrote afterwards that:\n\n<blockquote>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret<ref>{{cite book|last=Cromwell |first=Oliver|title=''\"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\"'' |editor=[[Thomas Carlyle]]|publisher=William H.

While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.<ref>Fraser, Antonia (1973).

Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.100.</ref>\n\nOne of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament.<ref>Fraser, pp.321\u2013322; Lenihan 2000, p.113.</ref> At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.<ref>Fraser, p.355.</ref>\n\nThe Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]] mostly consisted of long sieges of fortified cities and [[guerrilla warfare]] in the countryside. The last Catholic-held town, [[Galway]], surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April of the following year.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn the wake of the Commonwealth's conquest of the island of Ireland, the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.314.</ref> All Catholic-owned land was confiscated under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652]] and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament's financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur094.htm |title= Act for the Settlement of Ireland, 12 August 1652, Henry Scobell, ii. 197.

On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England.<ref>Lenihan 2000, p. 1O22; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare.

Cromwell demanded that no supplies were to be seized from the civilian inhabitants and that everything should be fairly purchased; \"I do hereby warn....all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whatsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy.....as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishhistorylinks.net/Historical_Documents/Cromwell.html|title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches II: Letters from Ireland, 1649 and 1650| first=Thomas |last=Carlyle|year= 1897 |publisher= Chapman and Hall Ltd, London|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Robert Walker.jpg|thumb|left|Oliver Cromwell {{circa|1649}} by [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]].

Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government.<ref>Worden, Blair (1977). ''The Rump Parliament'' (Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|0-521-29213-1}}, ch.16\u201317.</ref> Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers.

They took up the suggestion of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]] for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of [[saint]]s. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs\u2014which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth\u2014he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Roots|1989|pp=8\u201327}} The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called [[Barebone's Parliament]] after one of its members, [[Praise-God Barebone]]. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1982).

It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake \"the chief magistracy and the administration of government\".

Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=David Hackett |authorlink1=David Hackett Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1991 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195069051 |pages=219\u2013220 |chapter=The South of England to Virginia: Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants, 1642\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654.

After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament's bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of \u00a3200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value in which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.<ref>Aylmer, G.E., ''Rebellion or Revolution?

He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England.<ref>Hirst, p.173.</ref> During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of \"triers\" was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of \"ejectors\" was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a [[Penruddock uprising|Royalist uprising in March 1655]], led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the Commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]\u2014instated in September 1656\u2014voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.<ref>Durston, Christopher (1998).

It was this\u2014allied to Cromwell's tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside Puritanism\u2014that led to his [[Resettlement of the Jews in England|encouraging Jews to return to England]] in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars.<ref>Hirst, p.137.</ref> There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell's decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on [[Matthew 23]]:37\u201339 and [[Romans 11]]. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:12\u201315 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again\".<ref>Roots 1989, p.128.</ref> The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655\u2014comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.<ref>Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\", in Beales, D. and Best, G.

The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice: Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.<ref>Masson, p. 354</ref>\n\n==Death and posthumous execution==\n{{See also|Oliver Cromwell's head}}\n[[File:WarwickCastle CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Oliver Cromwell's death mask at [[Warwick Castle]]]]\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and from \"stone\" ([[kidney stone disease]]). In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the [[Doge of Venice]] in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death.{{sfn|McMains|2015|p=75}} The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter [[Elizabeth Claypole]] in August.

Oxford civil war historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that \"the man\u2014it is ever so with the noblest\u2014was greater than his work\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.315.</ref> Gardiner stressed Cromwell's dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, while underestimating Cromwell's religious conviction.<ref>Worden, pp.256\u2013260.</ref> Cromwell's foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his \"constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea\".<ref>Gardiner (1901), p.318.</ref> [[Calvin Coolidge]] described Cromwell as a brilliant statesman who \"dared to oppose the tyranny of the kings.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last= Coolidge\n |first= Calvin \n |date= 1929\n |title= The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge\n |location= USA\n |publisher=\n |page= 29\n |isbn= 978-1410216229\n |author-link=\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, Cromwell's reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[Italian fascism|Italy]]. Harvard historian [[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morrill |first1=John |year=1990 |title=Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell |url= |journal=Historical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=629\u2013639 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X0001356X}}</ref>\n\nLate 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime. [[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.<ref>Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in ''History'' 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, {{ISSN|0018-2648}}.</ref> Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell's writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.<ref>Morrill (2004). \"Cromwell, Oliver (1599\u20131658)\", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (Oxford University Press) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765 Oxforddnb.com]; Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\".

[[Queen Victoria]] was invited to open the new [[Manchester Town Hall]], and she allegedly consented on the condition that the statue be removed. The statue remained, Victoria declined, and the town hall was opened by the Lord Mayor. During the 1980s, the statue was relocated outside [[Wythenshawe Hall]], which had been occupied by Cromwell's troops.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moss |first=John |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/history2.html |title=Manchester during the Reformation, Oliver Cromwell & the English Civil Wars |publisher=Manchester2002-uk.com |accessdate=29 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523155732/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/history2.html |archivedate=23 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1890s, Parliamentary plans turned controversial to erect a [[Statue of Oliver Cromwell, Westminster|statue of Cromwell outside Parliament]].

[[Winston Churchill]] was First Lord of the Admiralty before [[World War I]], and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS ''Oliver Cromwell''. The suggestion was vetoed by [[George V of Great Britain|King George V]] because of his personal feelings and because he felt that it was unwise to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish political unrest]], especially given the anger caused by the statue outside Parliament. Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Admiral Battenberg]] that the King's decision must be treated as final.<ref>[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'', New York: [[Alfred A.

He acted simultaneously as head of state and head of government of the new [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland|republican commonwealth]].\n\nCromwell was born into the middle gentry to a family descended from the sister of [[Henry VIII]]'s minister [[Thomas Cromwell]].

He was elected Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 and for Cambridge in the [[Short Parliament|Short]] (1640) and [[Long Parliament|Long]] (1640\u20131649) Parliaments. He entered the [[English Civil War]]s on the side of the \"[[Roundheads]]\" or Parliamentarians, nicknamed \"Old [[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]]\". He demonstrated his ability as a commander and was quickly promoted from leading a single cavalry troop to being one of the principal commanders of the [[New Model Army]], playing an important role under General Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] in the defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalist (\"Cavalier\")]] forces.\n\nCromwell was one of the signatories of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]'s death warrant in 1649, and he dominated the short-lived [[Commonwealth of England]] as a member of the [[Rump Parliament]] (1649\u20131653). He was selected to take command of the English campaign in Ireland in 1649\u20131650. Cromwell's forces defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. During this period, a series of [[Penal Laws]] were passed against Roman Catholics (a significant minority in England and Scotland but the vast majority in Ireland), and a substantial amount of their land was confiscated. Cromwell also led a campaign against the Scottish army between 1650 and 1651.\n\nOn 20 April 1653, he dismissed the Rump Parliament by force, setting up a short-lived nominated assembly known as [[Barebone's Parliament]] before being invited by his fellow leaders to rule as [[Lord Protector]] of England (which included Wales at the time), Scotland, and Ireland from 16 December 1653.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cromwell_oliver.shtml|title=Oliver Cromwell (1599\u20131658)}}</ref> As a ruler, he executed an aggressive and effective foreign policy.

For several generations, the Williamses added the surname of Cromwell to their own, styling themselves \"Williams alias Cromwell\" in legal documents ({{harvnb|Noble|1784|pp=11\u201313}})}} then to Oliver's father Robert Williams, alias Cromwell (c. 1560\u20131617), who married Elizabeth Steward (c. 1564 \u2013 1654), probably in 1591.

A place in this influential network would prove crucial to Cromwell's military and political career.

His letter in 1626 to Henry Downhall, an [[Arminian]] minister, suggests that Cromwell had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Morrill, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> However, there is evidence that Cromwell went through a period of personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the [[Huntingdonshire]] [[county town]] of [[Huntingdon]]. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including ''valde melancholicus'' (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]]. In 1629 he was caught up in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon over a new charter for the town, as a result of which he was called before the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1630.<ref>Morrill, pp.&nbsp;24\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell House Ely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell's House]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]]]\n\nIn 1631 Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon\u2014probably as a result of the dispute\u2014and moved to a farmstead in nearby [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] (then in Huntingdonshire, now in Cambridgeshire). This signified a major step down in society compared with his previous position, and seems to have had a significant emotional and spiritual impact. A 1638 letter survives from Cromwell to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, and gives an account of his spiritual awakening. The letter outlines how, having been \"the chief of sinners\", Cromwell had been called to be among \"the congregation of the firstborn\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The language of this letter, which is saturated with biblical quotations and which represents Cromwell as having been saved from sin by God's mercy, places his faith firmly within the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] beliefs that the [[Reformation]] had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices needed to be fully removed from the church.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> It would appear that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to [[Connecticut]] in America, but was prevented by the government from leaving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml|title=A unique leader|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a [[yeoman]] farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as [[tithe]] collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around \u00a3300\u2013400 per year;<ref>Gaunt, p.34.</ref> by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and [[Essex]].<ref name=bcw>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/oliver-cromwell|title=Oliver Cromwell|publisher=British Civil Wars Project|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Member of Parliament: 1628\u201329 and 1640\u20131642==\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] in the Parliament of 1628\u20131629, as a client of the Montagu family of [[Hinchingbrooke House]]. He made little impression: records for the Parliament show only one speech (against the [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Bishop [[Richard Neile]]), which was poorly received.<ref>Morrill, pp.25\u201326.</ref> After dissolving this Parliament, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], shortage of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the [[Short Parliament]]. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London 1973</ref>\n\nA second Parliament was called later the same year, and became known as the [[Long Parliament]]. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628\u201329, it is likely that Cromwell owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of [[John Lilburne]], who had become a Puritan [[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the first two years of the Long Parliament Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the [[House of Lords]] and Members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Essex]], [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick|Warwick]] and [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], Oliver St John and [[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele|Viscount Saye and Sele]].<ref>Adamson, John (1990). \"Oliver Cromwell and the Long Parliament\", in Morrill, p. 57.</ref> At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group's political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, it was Cromwell who put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill and later took a role in drafting the [[Root and Branch Bill]] for the abolition of [[episcopacy]].<ref>Adamson, p. 53.</ref>\n\n==Military commander: 1642\u20131646==\n\n===English Civil War begins===\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the [[English Civil War]]. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the [[Eastern Association]] under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]]. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in [[East Anglia]] in 1643, notably at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1643-lincolnshire.htm#gainsborough |title=1643: Civil War in Lincolnshire |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2008}}</ref> He was subsequently appointed governor of the [[Isle of Ely]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elystandard.co.uk/ely-life/fenland-riots-as-country-slides-into-civil-war-1-258647|title=Fenland riots|website=www.elystandard.co.uk|accessdate=12 January 2019}}</ref> and a [[colonel]] in the Eastern Association.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n=== Marston Moor 1644 ===\nBy the time of the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]] of horse in Manchester's army. The success of his cavalry in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment during the battle but returning to help force the victory.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by [[Antonia Fraser]], London 1973, {{ISBN|0297765566}}, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], pp. 120\u2013129.</ref> After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor he wrote a famous letter to his [[Valentine Walton|brother-in-law]].

Cromwell's experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of \"low birth\" as officers in the army, to which he replied: \"If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them&nbsp;... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else\".<ref>Letter to Sir William Spring, September 1643, quoted in Carlyle, Thomas (ed.)

This forced members of the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords|Lords]], such as [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Manchester]], to choose between civil office and military command. All of them\u2014except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament\u2014chose to renounce their military positions. The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms. In April 1645 the [[New Model Army]] finally took to the field, with [[Sir Thomas Fairfax]] in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Battle of Naseby 1645===\n[[File:Charles Landseer Cromwell Battle of Naseby.JPG|thumb|Cromwell in the Battle of Naseby in 1645. [[Charles Landseer]].]]\nAt the critical [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the [[Battle of Langport]] on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress [[Basing House]], later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender.<ref>Kenyon, John & Ohlmeyer, Jane (eds.) (2000). ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland, and Ireland 1638\u20131660'' (Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|0-19-280278-X}}, p.141</ref> Cromwell also took part in successful sieges at [[Bridgwater]], [[Sherborne]], Bristol, [[Devizes]], and [[Winchester]], then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the [[First English Civil War]]. Cromwell and Fairfax took the formal surrender of the Royalists at [[Oxford]] in June 1646.<ref name=bcw/>\n\n===Cromwell's military style===\nCromwell had no formal training in military tactics, and followed the common practice of ranging his [[cavalry]] in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his [[moral authority]]. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and are likely to have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.<ref>[[Austin Herbert Woolrych|Woolrych, Austin]] (1990). ''Cromwell as a soldier'', in Morrill, pp.117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nCromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time, and was a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.<ref>''Cromwell: Our Chief of Men'', by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], {{ISBN|0-297-76556-6}}, pp. 154\u2013161</ref>\n\n==Politics: 1647\u20131649==\nIn February 1647 Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he had recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in [[Saffron Walden]] to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saffronwaldenreporter.co.uk/news/a-lasting-place-in-history-1-377880|title=A lasting place in history|publisher=Saffron Walden Reporter|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet [[George Joyce]] seized the King from Parliament's imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the \"[[Heads of Proposals]]\" pleased Cromwell in principle and would allow for further negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Maurice|title=The Greatness of Oliver Cromwell|year=1957|publisher=Collier- Macmillan LTD.|location=London|pages=187\u2013190}}</ref> It was designed to check the powers of the [[executive branch|executive]], to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory [[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] settlement.<ref>Although there is debate over whether Cromwell and Ireton were the authors of the Heads of Proposals or acting on behalf of Saye and Sele: Adamson, John (1987). \"The English Nobility and the Projected Settlement of 1647\", in ''Historical Journal'', 30, 3; Kishlansky, Mark (1990). \"Saye What?\" in ''Historical Journal'' 33, 4.</ref>\n\nMany in the army, such as the [[Levellers]] led by [[John Lilburne]], thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like [[Thomas Rainsborough|Colonel Rainsborough]] on the other. The [[Putney Debates]] ultimately broke up without reaching a resolution.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1987).

If you move it down, it breaks the line into the next topic.--->\n\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the [[Second English Civil War]] in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms. Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by [[Rowland Laugharne]], winning back [[Chepstow Castle]] on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of [[Tenby]]. The castle at [[Carmarthen]] was destroyed by burning. The much stronger castle at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], however, fell only after a siege of eight weeks. Cromwell dealt leniently with the ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had previously been members of the parliamentary army, [[John Poyer]] eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|title=Spartacus: Rowland Laugharne at Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025014050/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/STUlaugharneJ.htm|archivedate=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nCromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the [[Engagers]]) who had invaded England. At [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Preston]], Cromwell, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, won a decisive victory against an army twice as large.<ref>Gardiner (1901), pp.144\u201347; Gaunt (1997) 94\u201397.</ref>\n\nDuring 1648, Cromwell's letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that \"they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land\". A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of [[Gideon]]'s defeat of the [[Midian]]ites at Ain Harod.<ref>Morrill and Baker (2008), p.31.</ref> These letters suggest that it was Cromwell's faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament's decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the [[Treaty of Newport]], that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God's chosen instrument.<ref>Adamson, pp.76\u201384.</ref> The episode shows Cromwell's firm belief in \"[[Providentialism]]\"\u2014that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of \"chosen people\" (whom God had \"provided\" for such purposes). Cromwell believed, during the Civil Wars, that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God's approval of his actions, and defeats as signs that God was directing him in another direction.<ref>Jendrysik, p. 79</ref>\n\n===King tried and executed===\n{{main|High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|Execution of Charles I}}\nIn December 1648, in an episode that became known as [[Pride's Purge]], a troop of soldiers headed by Colonel [[Thomas Pride]] forcibly removed from the [[Long Parliament]] all those who were not supporters of the [[Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the New Model Army and the Independents.<ref>Macaulay, p. 68</ref> Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the [[Rump Parliament]], agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars.<ref name=bcw/> Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (\"The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.\").<ref>Coward 1991, p. 65</ref>\n\nThe death warrant for Charles was eventually signed by 59 of the trying court's members, including Cromwell (who was the third to sign it).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/civilwar/collections/deathwarrant/|title=Death Warrant of King Charles I|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the King, or \"[[regicide]]\", was controversial, if for no other reason due to the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107021024/http://faithandfreedombook.com/faith_and_freedom_chapter_11_oliver_cromwell's_contribution_to_liberty_ben_hart.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2015|title=Oliver Cromwell Destroys the \"Divine Right of Kings\"|first=Ben|last=Hart|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref> Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: \"None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who stooped to sign it.

The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller [[English Council of State|Council of State]] also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the \"Rump\" and was appointed a member of the Council. In the early months after the execution of Charles I, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of [[English Civil War|civil war]] in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. However, only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The [[Cavalier Parliament|Royalists]], meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as \"[[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]]\". In March, Cromwell was chosen by the Rump to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied Cromwell in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the \"[[New Model Army]]\". The \"[[Leveller]]\" or \"[[Agitator]]\" movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the manifesto \"[[Agreement of the People]]\" in 1647. Cromwell and the rest of the \"[[Grandees]]\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should only extend to the landowners. In the \"[[Putney Debates]]\" of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. There were rebellions and mutinies following the debates, and in 1649, the [[Bishopsgate mutiny]] resulted in the execution of Leveller [[Robert Lockyer]] by firing squad. The next month, the [[Banbury mutiny]] occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at [[Andover, England|Andover]] and [[Burford]] in May, Cromwell departed for Ireland from [[Bristol]] at the end of July.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Plant |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm |title=The Levellers |publisher=British-civil-wars.co.uk |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish campaign: 1649\u201350==\n{{See also|Irish Confederate Wars|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland}}\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649&ndash;50. Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederate Catholics]] and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\".<ref>Quoted in Lenihan, Padraig (2000). ''Confederate Catholics at War'' ([[Cork University Press]]), {{ISBN|1-85918-244-5}}, p.115.</ref>\n\nCromwell's hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of [[Pope|papal]] and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in [[continental Europe]].<ref>Fraser, pp.74\u201376.</ref> Cromwell's association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by [[Gael|Irish (\"Gaels\")]] and [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English in Ireland]], and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.<ref>Fraser, pp.326\u2013328.</ref>\n\nParliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell's invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held only outposts in [[Dublin]] and [[Derry]]. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After his landing at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the [[Battle of Rathmines]]), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]] to secure logistical supply from England. At the [[Siege of Drogheda]] in September 1649, Cromwell's troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town's capture\u2014comprising around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.98.</ref> Cromwell wrote afterwards that:\n\n<blockquote>I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret<ref>{{cite book|last=Cromwell |first=Oliver|title=''\"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\"'' |editor=[[Thomas Carlyle]]|publisher=William H.

While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.<ref>Fraser, Antonia (1973).

Kilkenny surrendered on terms, as did many other towns like [[New Ross]] and [[Carlow]], but Cromwell failed to take [[Waterford]], and at the [[siege of Clonmel]] in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.100.</ref>\n\nOne of his major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]], Cromwell persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to change sides and fight with the Parliament.<ref>Fraser, pp.321\u2013322; Lenihan 2000, p.113.</ref> At this point, word reached Cromwell that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the [[Covenanter]] regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from [[Youghal]] on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.<ref>Fraser, p.355.</ref>\n\nThe Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell's departure. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Edmund Ludlow]] mostly consisted of long sieges of fortified cities and [[guerrilla warfare]] in the countryside. The last Catholic-held town, [[Galway]], surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April of the following year.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn the wake of the Commonwealth's conquest of the island of Ireland, the public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured.<ref>Kenyon & Ohlmeyer, p.314.</ref> All Catholic-owned land was confiscated under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652]] and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament's financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur094.htm |title= Act for the Settlement of Ireland, 12 August 1652, Henry Scobell, ii. 197.

On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England.<ref>Lenihan 2000, p. 1O22; \"After Cromwell returned to England in 1650, the conflict degenerated into a grindingly slow counter-insurgency campaign punctuated by some quite protracted sieges...the famine of 1651 onwards was a man-made response to stubborn guerrilla warfare.

Cromwell demanded that no supplies were to be seized from the civilian inhabitants and that everything should be fairly purchased; \"I do hereby warn....all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whatsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy.....as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishhistorylinks.net/Historical_Documents/Cromwell.html|title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches II: Letters from Ireland, 1649 and 1650| first=Thomas |last=Carlyle|year= 1897 |publisher= Chapman and Hall Ltd, London|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Robert Walker.jpg|thumb|left|Oliver Cromwell {{circa|1649}} by [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]].

Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government.<ref>Worden, Blair (1977).

They took up the suggestion of [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Major-General Thomas Harrison]] for a \"[[sanhedrin]]\" of [[saint]]s. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] beliefs\u2014which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth\u2014he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech at the opening of the assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Roots|1989|pp=8\u201327}} The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called [[Barebone's Parliament]] after one of its members, [[Praise-God Barebone]]. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.<ref>[[Woolrych, Austin]] (1982).

It made Cromwell Lord Protector for life to undertake \"the chief magistracy and the administration of government\". Cromwell was sworn in as Lord Protector on 16 December 1653, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia.<ref>Gaunt, p.155.</ref> However, from this point on Cromwell signed his name 'Oliver P', the ''P'' being an abbreviation for ''Protector'', which was similar to the style of monarchs who used an ''R'' to mean ''Rex'' or ''Regina'', and it soon became the norm for others to address him as \"Your Highness\".<ref>Gaunt, p.156.</ref> As Protector, he had the power to call and dissolve parliaments but was obliged under the Instrument to seek the majority vote of a Council of State. Nevertheless, Cromwell's power was buttressed by his continuing popularity among the army.

Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb his fellow Puritans who were usurping control over the Maryland Colony at the [[Battle of the Severn]], by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell's rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fischer |first1=David Hackett |authorlink1=David Hackett Fischer |title=Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1991 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780195069051 |pages=219\u2013220 |chapter=The South of England to Virginia: Distressed Cavaliers and Indentured Servants, 1642\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_gd63RFlXIMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA207#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the [[First Protectorate Parliament|first Protectorate parliament]] at its inaugural meeting on 3 September 1654.

After some initial gestures approving appointments previously made by Cromwell, the Parliament began to work on a radical programme of constitutional reform. Rather than opposing Parliament's bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of \u00a3200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value in which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.<ref>Aylmer, G.E., ''Rebellion or Revolution?

He aimed to restore liberty of conscience and promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England.<ref>Hirst, p.173.</ref> During the early months of the Protectorate, a set of \"triers\" was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of \"ejectors\" was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the [[Rule of the Major-Generals|Major Generals]] that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a [[Penruddock uprising|Royalist uprising in March 1655]], led by [[John Penruddock|Sir John Penruddock]], Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals\u2014called \"godly governors\"\u2014were central not only to [[national security]], but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised [[militia]] forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the Commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the [[Second Protectorate Parliament|second Protectorate parliament]]\u2014instated in September 1656\u2014voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.<ref>Durston, Christopher (1998).

At the Whitehall conference of December 1655 he quoted from St. Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] 10:12\u201315 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of King: \"I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build [[Jericho]] again\".<ref>Roots 1989, p.128.</ref> The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of [[Hispaniola]] in the [[West Indies]] in 1655\u2014comparing himself to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]], who had brought the [[Israelites]] defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho.<ref>Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\", in Beales, D. and Best, G.

The event in part echoed a [[coronation]], using many of its symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were laid out in the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the [[Cromwell's Other House|Other House]] as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice: Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and [[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.<ref>Masson, p. 354</ref>\n\n==Death and posthumous execution==\n{{See also|Oliver Cromwell's head}}\n[[File:WarwickCastle CromwellDeathmaskcrop.JPG|thumb|upright|Oliver Cromwell's death mask at [[Warwick Castle]]]]\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and from \"stone\" ([[kidney stone disease]]). In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the [[Doge of Venice]] in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death.{{sfn|McMains|2015|p=75}} The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter [[Elizabeth Claypole]] in August.

An example is ''The Perfect Politician'', which describes how Cromwell \"loved men more than books\" and provides a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience who is brought down by pride and ambition.<ref>Morrill, pp. 279\u201381.</ref> An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] in his ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. Clarendon famously declares that Cromwell \"will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man\".<ref name=g9>Gaunt, p.9.</ref> He argues that Cromwell's rise to power had been helped by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness. Clarendon was not one of Cromwell's confidantes, and his account was written after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]].<ref name=g9/>\n\nDuring the early 18th century, Cromwell's image began to be adopted and reshaped by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy.  [[John Toland]] rewrote [[Edmund Ludlow]]'s ''Memoirs'' in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny. Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a despot who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s.<ref>Worden, Blair (2001).

[[Thomas Carlyle]] continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing an annotated collection of his letters and speeches, and describing English Puritanism as \"the last of all our Heroisms\" while taking a negative view of his own era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=Thomas |title=Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches |date=December 1843 |url=http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carlyle__Cromwell.pdf}}</ref> By the late 19th century, Carlyle's portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness.

Harvard historian [[Wilbur Cortez Abbott]], for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell's letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as [[John Morrill (historian)|John Morrill]] have criticised both Abbott's interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morrill |first1=John |year=1990 |title=Textualising and Contextualising Cromwell |url= |journal=Historical Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=629\u2013639 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X0001356X}}</ref>\n\nLate 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell's faith and of his authoritarian regime. [[Austin Woolrych]] explored the issue of \"dictatorship\" in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell's rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government.<ref>Woolrych, Austin (1990). \"The Cromwellian Protectorate: a Military Dictatorship?\" in ''History'' 1990 75(244): 207\u201331, {{ISSN|0018-2648}}.</ref> Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell's writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.<ref>Morrill (2004). \"Cromwell, Oliver (1599\u20131658)\", in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (Oxford University Press) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6765 Oxforddnb.com]; Worden, Blair (1985). \"Oliver Cromwell and the sin of Achan\".

[[Winston Churchill]] was First Lord of the Admiralty before [[World War I]], and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS ''Oliver Cromwell''.

Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Admiral Battenberg]] that the King's decision must be treated as final.<ref>[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'', New York: [[Alfred A.
