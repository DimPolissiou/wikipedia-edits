TransGaming obtained the source to the original Wine project when it was under the [[MIT License]] and this license placed no requirements on how TransGaming published their software. TransGaming decided to release their software as proprietary software.<ref>[http://www.maximumpc.com/article/howtos/how_run_windows_games_linux How to run Windows games on Linux] - [[Maximum PC]]</ref> TransGaming does release portions of the source code via CVS; however, it attaches legal restrictions. Cedega includes licensed support for several types of CD-based copy protection (notably SecuROM and SafeDisc), the code for which TransGaming say they are under contract not to disclose.\n\nIn 2002 the Wine project changed its license to the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This means that anyone who publishes a modified version of Wine must publish the source code under an LGPL-compatible license. TransGaming halted using code contributed to Wine when the license was changed, though this has resumed with TransGaming integrating certain LGPL portions of Wine into Cedega and placing those portions of the source code on their public servers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTransGaming offers a CVS tree for Cedega without copy protection related code and texture compression through its own [https://web.archive.org/web/20050406040933/http://cvs.transgaming.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ repositories] with mixed [[LGPL]], [[AFPL]] and bstring licensing.<ref name=\"License\">{{cite web | url = http://www.cedega.com/license.php?source=1 | publisher = TransGaming | title = Software License }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [http://www.cedegawiki.net/Point2Play Point2Play] graphical frontend for Cedega is also not found on the CVS.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522034255/http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=193814%2F Scripts] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080112184849/http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=howto%20cedega%20cvs guides] have been made by the community to facilitate building Cedega from the source tree.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Video games}}\n* [[Wine (software)|Wine]] \u2014 the [[free software]]/[[open source software]] on which Cedega is based.\n* [[CrossOver]] \u2014 another commercial proprietary Wine-based product, targeted at running productivity/business applications and, recently, games.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110110171608/http://gametreelinux.com/ Developers Page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161229090754/http://www.cedegawiki.net/Welcome_to_the_GameTree_Linux_Wiki GameTree Linux Wiki] \u2014 User-maintained database of games that work and don\u2019t work with Cedega, along with game-specific setup instructions and tweaks\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060813022728/http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=LinuxCadieuxCedega Screencast for installing and testing] Cedega on SuSE Linux at showmedo\n\n{{Unix\u2013Windows interoperability}}\n\n[[Category:Compatibility layers]]\n[[Category:Software derived from or incorporating Wine]]\n[[Category:Software forks]]\n[[Category:Discontinued software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n| name = Cedega\n| screenshot =\n| caption = Cedega 6.0 running The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n| developer = [[Findev|TransGaming Technologies]]\n| latest_release_version = 7.3\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2009|06|02}}\n| status  = Discontinued\n| operating_system = [[Linux]]\n| genre = [[Compatibility layer]]\n| license = [[Cedega (software)#Controversy|See main article]]\n| website = {{URL|gametreelinux.com}}\n}}\n\n'''Cedega''' (formerly known as '''WineX''') was the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Fork (software development)|fork]] by [[Findev|TransGaming Technologies]] of [[Wine (software)|Wine]], from the last version of [[Wine (software)|Wine]] under the [[X11 license]] before switching to [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU LGPL]].

TransGaming similarly discourages source-based distributions like [[Gentoo Linux]] from creating automated tools to let people build their own version of Cedega from the public CVS.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030804-newsletter.xml#doc_chap1_sect4 | publisher = Gentoo | title = Newsletter notice about removal of Cedega CVS | access-date = 2007-01-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022045029/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030804-newsletter.xml#doc_chap1_sect4 | archive-date = 2006-10-22 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Wine project originally released Wine under the same [[MIT License]] as the X Window System, but owing to concern about [[proprietary software|proprietary]] versions of Wine not contributing their changes back to the core project,<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2002-February/003912.html\n | title=Wine license change\n | first=Jeremy | last=White\n | date=6 February 2002\n | accessdate=27 April 2010\n}}</ref> work as of March 2002 has used the LGPL for its licensing.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2002-February/004487.html\n | title=License change vote results\n | author=Alexandre Julliard\n | date=18 February 2002\n | accessdate=27 April 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functionality==\nIn some cases it closely mimiced the experience that Windows users have (insert disc, run Setup.exe, play).

Users attribute the apparent lack of interest from TransGaming on Cedega to their focus on [[TransGaming Technologies#Cider|Cider]], a similar MS-Win32, Wine-based API layer for Mac OS X systems, supported by [[Electronic Arts]] to bring their Windows native games to Mac.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.transgaming.com/news/?id=50 | title = TransGaming to Develop EA Titles for Mac OS X | access-date = 2007-12-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210211745/http://www.transgaming.com/news/?id=50# | archive-date = 2007-12-10 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2007's Development Status report, TransGaming explained that a number of modification have been made to Cedega\u2019s code to add Wine's implementation of the [[Windows Installer|MSI]] installation system and to be able to incorporate more of Wine\u2019s codebase.<ref name=\"Cider\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedega.com/theden/?p=6 |publisher=Cedega |title=Cider }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It has not been confirmed if these changes are in conformance with Wine's new license (GNU [[LGPL]]).\n\nAlso on the November 13, 2007 report, it was announced that all of the work done on Cider will be merged back into Cedega (since both share the same code). Among the new features are \u201cnew copy protection, 2.0 shader updates, a head start on shader model 3.0, performance upgrades, a self updating user interface\u201d and others.<ref name = \"Cider\" />\nOn September 23, 2008, Cedega officially presented the new version 6.1.\n\nCedega Gaming Service was retired on February 28, 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedega.com/ | title = Official announcement about retirement of Cedega}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nTransGaming\u2019s business practice of benefiting financially from the Wine project, without contributing anything back to it has drawn criticism. TransGaming obtained the source to the original Wine project when it was under the [[MIT License]] and this license placed no requirements on how TransGaming published their software. TransGaming decided to release their software as proprietary software.<ref>[http://www.maximumpc.com/article/howtos/how_run_windows_games_linux How to run Windows games on Linux] - [[Maximum PC]]</ref> TransGaming does release portions of the source code via CVS; however, it attaches legal restrictions. Cedega includes licensed support for several types of CD-based copy protection (notably SecuROM and SafeDisc), the code for which TransGaming say they are under contract not to disclose.\n\nIn 2002 the Wine project changed its license to the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This means that anyone who publishes a modified version of Wine must publish the source code under an LGPL-compatible license. TransGaming halted using code contributed to Wine when the license was changed, though this has resumed with TransGaming integrating certain LGPL portions of Wine into Cedega and placing those portions of the source code on their public servers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nTransGaming offers a CVS tree for Cedega without copy protection related code and texture compression through its own [https://web.archive.org/web/20050406040933/http://cvs.transgaming.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ repositories] with mixed [[LGPL]], [[AFPL]] and bstring licensing.<ref name=\"License\">{{cite web | url = http://www.cedega.com/license.php?source=1 | publisher = TransGaming | title = Software License }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [http://www.cedegawiki.net/Point2Play Point2Play] graphical frontend for Cedega is also not found on the CVS.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522034255/http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=193814%2F Scripts] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080112184849/http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=howto%20cedega%20cvs guides] have been made by the community to facilitate building Cedega from the source tree.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Video games}}\n* [[Wine (software)|Wine]] \u2014 the [[free software]]/[[open source software]] on which Cedega is based.\n* [[CrossOver]] \u2014 another commercial proprietary Wine-based product, targeted at running productivity/business applications and, recently, games.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110110171608/http://gametreelinux.com/ Developers Page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161229090754/http://www.cedegawiki.net/Welcome_to_the_GameTree_Linux_Wiki GameTree Linux Wiki] \u2014 User-maintained database of games that work and don\u2019t work with Cedega, along with game-specific setup instructions and tweaks\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060813022728/http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=LinuxCadieuxCedega Screencast for installing and testing] Cedega on SuSE Linux at showmedo\n\n[[Category:Compatibility layers]]\n[[Category:Software derived from or incorporating Wine]]\n[[Category:Software forks]]\n[[Category:Discontinued software]]\n", "name_user": "Ghettoblaster", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedega_(software)"}

It was the 15th [[Anzac Test]] played between the two nations since the first was played under the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] banner in [[1997 Anzac Test|1997]]. It was also the first Test match played in Sydney since the [[2010 Rugby League Four Nations|2010 Four Nations]] tournament. A [[All Stars Match#2014|Women's All Stars Match]] which is the [[Women's rugby league]] version of the game was played as the main curtain raiser for the Test, which was won 24-0 by the Women's All Stars.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/womens-all-stars-too-strong-in-historic-clash/tabid/10874/newsid/78109/default.aspx</ref>\n\n==Pre-game==\nIn the lead up to the test, Australia named an expected team, though [[Jarryd Hayne]], a revelation in the unfamiliar position of centre during the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013 World Cup]], was unavailable through injury and was replaced by [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury]]'s [[Josh Morris (rugby league)|Josh Morris]] who was playing along his twin brother, [[St George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]] winger [[Brett Morris|Brett]]. The twins were playing their fourth test alongside each other, and their first in Australia. [[Melbourne Storm|Melbourne]]'s incumbent Kangaroo halfback [[Cooper Cronk]] won a well publicised battle with [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]]'s [[Daly Cherry-Evans]] for the halfback role, though Cherry-Evans was chosen as a reserve being able to cover the halves, hooker or lock. Melbourne hooker [[Cameron Smith]] was playing in his 38th test for Australia and his 14th as captain. Coach [[Tim Sheens]] named experienced [[North Queensland Cowboys]] back [[Brent Tate]] as the squads 18th man. [[Brisbane Broncos]] utility player and fresh reserve [[Matt Gillett]] was the only player on debut for the Kangaroos, replacing injured Broncos team mate [[Sam Thaiday]].\n\nNew Zealand however were in trouble with a number of players missing from the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup Final|2013 World Cup Final]] loss to Australia in November. Not selected were the likes of [[Kevin Locke (rugby league)|Kevin Locke]] (languishing in the [[New Zealand Warriors]] [[NSW Cup]] side thanks to the presence of [[England national rugby league team|England]] fullback [[Sam Tomkins]] at the club), [[Manu Vatuvei]], [[Kieran Foran]], [[Jared Waerea-Hargreaves]], [[Isaac Luke]] and [[Sonny Bill Williams]]. While Foran and Luke were injured and Williams had made himself unavailable, the biggest shock were the omissions of powerhouse winger Vatuvei and [[Sydney Roosters]] premiership winning front rower Waerea-Hargreaves. The Kiwis featured five players on debut as Kearney publicly stated they were looking to the future. Playing their first test match for the Kiwis were Manly's [[Peta Hiku]] (fullback), [[New Zealand Warriors|Warriors]] [[Ben Henry]] and [[Siliva Havili]] (hooker and reserve), [[West Tigers]]' [[Martin Taupau]], and [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]]'s [[Isaac John]] who was playing for the Panthers NSW Cup affiliate the [[Windsor Wolves]] when selected. Although it was his debut for NZ, John had previous international experience having represented the [[Cook Islands national rugby league team|Cook Islands]] at the 2013 World Cup. Another debutante [[Kenny Bromwich]] was named as NZ's 18th man.\n\nDue to the relative inexperience of the New Zealanders, and that the Kangaroos were aiming for their 16th straight test win to equal the record of the teams that won 16 straight from 1979-1983, the Australians were short priced odds to win their 14th Anzac Test since the first was held under the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] banner in [[1997 Anzac Test|1997]] (though as a SL game, the [[Australian Rugby League]] (ARL) did not count it as an official Australian test).
