WWE began this with the March 13 episodes of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' and ''[[205 Live]]'', broadcasting both shows from the [[WWE Performance Center]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Their following episodes of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' followed suit with plans to continue this format until further notice, which included hosting [[WrestleMania 36]] at this venue. AEW began this format with the March 18 episode of ''[[AEW Dynamite|Dynamite]]'', as well as that day's tapings for ''[[AEW Dark|Dark]]'', broadcasting from [[Daily's Place]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], though after a couple of weeks at this venue, they moved to an undisclosed location as Daily's Place became a testing site for COVID-19.

Others, such as WWE and AEW, began presenting [[Behind closed doors (sport)|empty arena shows]]. WWE began this with the March 13 episodes of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' and ''[[205 Live]]'', broadcasting both shows from the [[WWE Performance Center]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Their following episodes of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' followed suit with plans to continue this format until further notice, which included hosting [[WrestleMania 36]] at this venue. AEW began this format with the March 18 episode of ''[[AEW Dynamite|Dynamite]]'', as well as that day's tapings for ''[[AEW Dark|Dark]]'', broadcasting from [[Daily's Place]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], though after a couple of weeks at this venue, they moved to an undisclosed location as Daily's Place became a testing site for COVID-19. The new location was not revealed to keep fans from attempting to interact with wrestlers.\n\n====Postponed events====\nThe following events were postponed from their originally scheduled dates.
