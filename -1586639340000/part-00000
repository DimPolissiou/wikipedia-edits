{"title_page": "Obligate parasite", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of organism}}\nAn '''obligate parasite''' or '''holoparasite''' is a [[parasite|parasitic]] [[organism]] that cannot complete its life-cycle without exploiting a suitable [[host (biology)|host]]. If an obligate parasite cannot obtain a host it will fail to [[reproduction|reproduce]]. This is opposed to a [[facultative parasite]], which can act as a parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have [[evolution|evolved]] a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts. Holoparasites and some hemiparasites are obligate.\n\nIt is advantageous for the parasite to preserve the health of their host when this is compatible with their nutritional and reproductive requirements, except when the death of the host is necessary for transmission.<ref name=\"Combes, C. 1997\">Combes, C.

Accordingly, it is convenient and customary to regard them as obligate [[intracellular parasite]]s.\n\nAmong the [[Vespidae]] family, ''[[Vespula austriaca]]'' is an example of an obligate reproductive parasite; its common host is ''[[Vespula acadica]]''.<ref name= \"venom\">{{Cite journal|jstor = 25084514|title = Venoms of a Parasitic and Two Nonparasitic Species of Yellowjackets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Schmidt|first = J.O|date = 1984|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 316\u2013322|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Reed|first2 = H.C|last3 = Akre|first3 = R.D}}</ref> In the genus ''[[Bumblebee|Bombus]]'', ''[[Bombus bohemicus|B. bohemicus]]'' is an obligate parasite of  ''B. locurum'', ''B. cryptarum'', and ''B. terrestris.''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Host-parasite interaction==\n\n===Life-cycle===\n[[Parasitic life cycle]]s involve the exploitation of at least one host. Parasites that infect a single species are said to have '''direct''' life-cycles.<ref name=\"May, R.M. 1979\">May, R. M. & Anderson, R. M. (1979) Population biology of infectious diseases.

M. 1979\"/> For example, the [[malaria]] plasmodium.\n\n====Intermediate or final Host====\nAn '''[[Intermediate host|intermediate]]''' or '''secondary''' host is exploited by the parasite only for a short transition period. A '''final''' or '''primary''' host is exploited by the parasite and is the only location in which the parasite is able to reach maturity and if possible, reproduce sexually.\nFor example, ''[[Ribeiroia ondatrae]]'' uses [[Ramshorn snail]] as its first intermediate host, amphibians and fish as second intermediate hosts and birds as definitive hosts.<ref>Goodman, B.

''PLoS ONE'' '''6'''(5):1\u201310.</ref>\n\n===Parasitic permanence===\nObligate parasites may not necessarily spend all of their time behaving as parasites. When a parasite is '''permanent''', a number of generations occur in or on the host of an infested individual. [[head louse|Head lice]] are an example of this. '''Temporary''' parasites are organisms whose parasitic mode of life is limited to a few or even one stage of development.<ref name=\"Balashov 2011\"/> An example of this is the larval stage of [[harvest mite]]s, while the adult stage is non-parasitic.\n\n===Location on host===\nThe parasite may live outside of the host '''[[Parasitism#types|ectoparasite]]'''; for example, a [[tick]]. Alternatively, the parasite may live within the host  '''[[Parasitism#types|endoparasite]]'''; for example, the [[Trematoda|fluke]]. \nAn obligate parasite that does not live directly in or on the host, but rather acts at a distance {{ndash}} for example, a [[cuckoo]] which hatches and is raised by non-relatives {{ndash}} is known as a [[brood parasite]].\n\n===Invasion strategies===\nIn order to establish infestation in a susceptible host, obligate parasites must evade defences before, during and after entry into the host.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 2069674| year = 1991| author1 = Hall| first1 = B.

[[Intracellular parasite]]s use various strategies to invade cells and subvert cellular signalling pathways.

E.g. the sexually transmitted ectoparasite ''Chrysomelobia labidomerae'', parasitizing the leaf beetle host ''[[Labidomera clivicollis]]''~ infected males exhibit increased sexual behaviour and as a result enhance inter- and intra- sexual contacts (copulation and competition) which provide more opportunities for parasite transmission.<ref name=\"Abbot, P. 2001\">Abbot, P. & Dll, L.

An example is ''Niphanda fusca,'' a butterfly that will release cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to trick the host ant, ''C. japonicus,'' into adopting the larva as their own in their own nest.

In 510, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow the tyrant [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]], son of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratos]].

But by 395&nbsp; BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], the latter two of which were formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the [[Corinthian War]], which ended inconclusively in 387&nbsp;BC. Later, in 371&nbsp;BC, the Theban generals [[Epaminondas]] and [[Pelopidas]] won a victory at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of [[Theban hegemony]]. Thebes sought to maintain its position until it was finally eclipsed by the rising power of [[Macedon]] in 346&nbsp; BC.\n\nUnder [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;II]], (359\u2013336&nbsp;BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the [[Paeonians]], the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]].

Roman victory in the [[Punic Wars]] and [[Macedonian Wars]] established Rome as a super-regional power by the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, followed up by the acquisition of [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]].

At the same time [[early Slavs]] settled in the Balkans.]]\n\nThe original Roman Senate continued to express decrees into the late 6th century, and the last Eastern Roman emperor to use [[Latin]] as the language of his court in Constantinople was emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], who reigned until 602. The overthrow of Maurice by his mutinying Danube army under [[Phocas]] resulted in the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and the decline of Balkan and Greek urban culture (leading to the flight of Balkan Latin speakers to the mountains, see [[Origin of the Romanians]]), and also provoked the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] in which all the great eastern cities except Constantinople were lost. The resulting turmoil did not end until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century finalized the irreversible loss of all the largest Eastern Roman imperial cities besides the capital itself. The emperor [[Heraclius]] in [[Constantinople]], who emerged during this period, conducted his court in Greek, not Latin, though Greek had always been an administrative language of the eastern Roman regions. Eastern-Western links weakened with the ending of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].\n\nThe Eastern Roman empire's capital city of [[Constantinople]] was left as the only unconquered large urban center of the original Roman empire, as well as being the largest city in Europe. Over the next millennium the Roman culture of that city would slowly change, leading modern historians to refer to it by a new name, [[Byzantine]], though many classical books, sculptures, and technologies survived there along with classical Roman cuisine and scholarly traditions, well into the Middle Ages, when much of it was \"rediscovered\" by visiting Western crusaders. Indeed, the inhabitants of Constantinople continued to refer to themselves as Romans, as did their eventual conquerors in 1453, the [[Ottomans]]. (See [[R\u00fbm]] and [[Romaioi]].) The classical scholarship and culture that was still preserved in Constantinople were brought by refugees fleeing its conquest in 1453 and helped to spark the [[Renaissance]], see [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]].\n\nUltimately, it was a slow, complex, and graduated change in the socioeconomic structure in [[European history]] that led to the changeover between Classical Antiquity and Medieval society and no specific date can truly exemplify that.\n\n== Political revivalism==\n{{Further|Carolingian Renaissance|Ottonian Renaissance|Renaissance|Classicism|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}\n\nIn politics, the late Roman conception of the Empire as a universal state, headed by one supreme divinely-appointed ruler, united with Christianity as a universal religion likewise headed by a supreme [[patriarch]], proved very influential, even after the disappearance of imperial authority in the west. This tendency reached its peak when [[Charlemagne]] was [[Coronation|crowned]] \"Roman Emperor\" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The notion that an [[emperor]] is a [[monarch]] who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world.\n\nThat model continued to exist in Constantinople for the entirety of the Middle Ages; the [[Byzantine Emperor]] was considered the sovereign of the entire Christian world. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was the Empire's highest-ranked cleric, but even he was subordinate to the Emperor, who was \"God's Vicegerent on Earth\". The Greek-speaking Byzantines and their descendants [[Romioi|continued to call themselves \"Romans\"]] until the creation of a new Greek state in 1832.\n\nAfter the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the Russian [[Czar of Russia|Czar]]s (a title derived from ''Caesar)'' claimed the Byzantine mantle as the champion of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]; [[Moscow]] was described as the \"[[Third Rome]]\" and the Czars ruled as divinely-appointed Emperors into the 20th century.\n\nDespite the fact that the Western Roman secular authority disappeared entirely in Europe, it still left traces. The [[Papacy]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in particular maintained Latin language, culture, and literacy for centuries; to this day the popes are called ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' which in the classical period was a title belonging to the Emperor, and the ideal of [[Christendom]] carried on the legacy of a united European civilization even after its political unity had disappeared.\n\nThe political idea of an Emperor in the West to match the Emperor in the East continued after the Western Roman Empire's collapse; it was revived by the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in&nbsp;800; the self-described [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled over central Europe until 1806.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] idea that the classical Roman virtues had been lost under medievalism was especially powerful in European politics of the 18th and 19th centuries. Reverence for Roman republicanism was strong among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the Latin American revolutionaries; the Americans described their new government as a ''republic'' (from ''[[res publica]]'') and gave it a ''Senate'' and a ''President'' (another Latin term), rather than make use of available English terms like ''commonwealth'' or ''parliament''.\n\nSimilarly in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France, republicanism and Roman martial virtues were upheld by the state, as can be seen in the architecture of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. During the revolution, France itself followed the transition from kingdom to republic to dictatorship to Empire (complete with Imperial Eagles) that Rome had undergone centuries earlier.\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n{{Main|Classicism|Classical studies}}\n[[File:Sanzio 01 cropped.png|thumb|250px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] walking and disputing. Detail from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509\u20131511)]]\n''Classical antiquity'' is a broad term for a long period of cultural [[history]]. Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. \"Classical antiquity\" often refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, <blockquote>\"the glory that was [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], the grandeur that was [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]!\" </blockquote>In the 18th and 19th centuries AD, reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] than it is today. Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[education]], and even [[architecture]] and [[History of sex|sexuality]].\n\n[[Epic poetry]] in [[Latin]] continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. [[John Milton]] and even [[Arthur Rimbaud]] received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, [[pastoral]] verse, and the endless use of characters and themes from [[Greek mythology]] left a deep mark on Western literature. In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival]]s, which seem more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek. [[Washington, DC]] is filled with large [[marble]] buildings with facades made out to look like [[Roman temple]]s, with columns constructed in the [[classical orders],] of architecture.\n\nIn philosophy, the efforts of St [[Thomas Aquinas]] were derived largely from the thought of [[Aristotle]], despite the intervening change in [[religion]] from [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic Polytheism]] to [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Greek and Roman authorities such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] formed the foundation of the practice of [[medicine]] even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the [[France|French]] [[theater]], [[tragedy|tragedians]] such as [[Moli\u00e8re]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the [[classical unities]] derived from Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The desire to [[dance]] like a latter-day vision of how the ancient Greeks did it moved [[Isadora Duncan]] to create her brand of [[ballet]].\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Further|Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n{{Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History|Ancient Greece|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Classical architecture]]\n* [[Classical tradition]]\n* [[Classics]] (Classical education)\n* [[Outline of classical studies]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Postclassical Era]] (the next period)\n\n; Regions during classical antiquity\n* [[Ancient history of Cyprus]]\n* [[Gaul]]\n* [[Hellenistic Greece]]\n* [[History of the Balkans]]\n* [[Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman Dacia]]\n* [[Troy]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Grinin L.

[[Cleomenes&nbsp;I]], king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy conducted by [[Isagoras]].\n\nThe [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013449&nbsp;BC), concluded by the [[Peace of Callias]] gave way not only to the liberation of Greece, [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Thrace]], and [[Ionia]] from [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian rule]], but also resulted in giving the dominant position of [[Athens]] in the [[Delian League]], which led to conflict with [[Sparta]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]], resulting in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp; BC), which ended in a Spartan victory.\n\nGreece entered the 4th century under [[Spartan hegemony]]. But by 395&nbsp; BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. [[Athens]], [[Argos]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Corinth]], the latter two of which were formerly Spartan allies, challenged Spartan dominance in the [[Corinthian War]], which ended inconclusively in 387&nbsp;BC. Later, in 371&nbsp;BC, the Theban generals [[Epaminondas]] and [[Pelopidas]] won a victory at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of [[Theban hegemony]]. Thebes sought to maintain its position until it was finally eclipsed by the rising power of [[Macedon]] in 346&nbsp; BC.\n\nUnder [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip&nbsp;II]], (359\u2013336&nbsp;BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the [[Paeonians]], the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]]. Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], (356\u2013323&nbsp; BC) managed to briefly extend [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]n power not only over the central Greek city-states but also to the [[Persian Empire]], including [[Egypt]] and lands as far east as the fringes of [[India]]. The classical period conventionally ends at the death of Alexander in 323&nbsp; BC and the fragmentation of his empire, which was at this time divided among the [[Diadochi]].\n\n==Hellenistic period (323\u2013146&nbsp;BC)==\n{{Main|Hellenistic period}}\n{{Further|Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic religion}}\n\nClassical Greece entered the Hellenistic period with the rise of [[Macedon]] and the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]]. [[Koine Greek|Greek]] became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' far beyond Greece itself, and Hellenistic culture interacted with the cultures of [[Seleucid Empire|Persia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Central Asia]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]]. Significant advances were made in the sciences ([[Ancient Greek geography|geography]], [[Greek astronomy|astronomy]], [[Greek mathematics|mathematics]] etc.), notably with the [[Peripatetic school|followers]] of [[Aristotle]] ([[Aristotelianism]]).\n\nThe Hellenistic period ended with the rise of the [[Roman Republic]] to a super-regional power in the 2nd century&nbsp;BC and the Roman conquest of Greece in 146&nbsp;BC.\n\n==Roman Republic (5th to 1st centuries&nbsp;BC)==\n[[File:Extent of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire between 218 BC and 117 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The extent of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in 218 BC (dark red), 133&nbsp;BC (light red), 44&nbsp;BC (orange), 14&nbsp;AD (yellow), after 14&nbsp;AD (green), and maximum extension under Trajan 117 (light green)]]\n{{Main|Roman Republic}}\n{{Further|culture of ancient Rome}}\n\nThe republican period of Ancient Rome began with the overthrow of the [[Roman Kingdom|Monarchy]] c.&nbsp;509&nbsp;BC and lasted over 450 years until its [[subversion (politics)|subversion]], through a series of [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]], into the [[Principate]] form of government and the Imperial period. During the half millennium of the Republic, Rome rose from a regional power of the [[Latium]] to the dominant force in Italy and beyond. The unification of Italy under Roman hegemony was a gradual process, brought about in a series of conflicts of the 4th and 3rd centuries, the [[Samnite Wars]], [[Latin War]], and [[Pyrrhic War]]. Roman victory in the [[Punic Wars]] and [[Macedonian Wars]] established Rome as a super-regional power by the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, followed up by the acquisition of [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]]. This tremendous increase of power was accompanied by economic instability and social unrest, leading to the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]], the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] and the [[First Triumvirate]], and finally the transformation to the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 1st century&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Roman Empire (1st century BC to 5th century&nbsp;AD) ==\n{{Main|Roman Empire}}\n\n[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The extent of the Roman Empire under Trajan,&nbsp;AD&nbsp;117]]\n\nThe precise end of the Republic is disputed by modern historians;{{NoteTag|The precise event which signaled the transition of the Roman Republic into the [[Roman Empire]] is a matter of interpretation. Historians have proposed the appointment of [[Julius Caesar]] as perpetual dictator (44&nbsp;BC), the [[Battle of Actium]] (September&nbsp;2, 31&nbsp;BC), and the [[Roman Senate]]'s grant of [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s extraordinary powers under the [[Augustus#First settlement|first settlement]] (January&nbsp;16, 27&nbsp;BC), as candidates for the defining pivotal [[Epoch (reference date)|event]].}} Roman citizens of the time did not recognize that the Republic had ceased to exist. The early [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] \"[[Roman Emperor|Emperors]]\" maintained that the ''[[res publica]]'' still existed, albeit under the protection of their extraordinary powers, and would eventually return to its full Republican form. The Roman state continued to call itself a ''res publica'' as long as it continued to use Latin as its official language.\n\nRome acquired imperial character ''de facto'' from the 130s&nbsp;BC with the acquisition of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], [[Illyria]], [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Hispania]], and definitely with the addition of [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] in the 1st century&nbsp;BC. At the time of the empire's maximal extension under [[Trajan]] (AD&nbsp;117), Rome controlled the entire [[Mediterranean]] as well as Gaul, parts of [[Germania]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Dacia]], Asia Minor, the [[Caucasus]] and [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nCulturally, the Roman Empire was significantly [[Hellenization|hellenized]], but also saw the rise of syncretic \"eastern\" traditions, such as [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], and most notably [[Origins of Christianity|Christianity]].\nThe empire began to decline in the [[crisis of the third century]]\n\nWhile sometimes compared with classical Greece,{{by whom|date=February 2019}} classical Rome had vast differences within their family life. Fathers had great power over their children, and husbands over their wives and these acts were commonly compared with slave-owners and slaves. In fact the word family, \"famiglia\" in Italian, actually referred to those who were under the authority of a male head of household. This included non-related members such as slaves and servants. In marriage, both men and women were loyal to one another and shared property. Divorce was first allowed starting in the first century BC and could be done by either man or woman.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History Global Perspectives|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8995-8|edition=2nd|date=2010-07-06}}</ref>\n\n==Late Antiquity (4th to 6th centuries&nbsp;AD)==\n[[File:Roman Empires 476AD.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] [[Roman Empire]]s by 476]]\n{{Main|Late Antiquity|Migration period|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}\n\nLate Antiquity saw the rise of [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] under [[Constantine I]], finally ousting the [[Roman imperial cult]] with the [[Theodosian decrees]] of&nbsp;393.

At the same time [[early Slavs]] settled in the Balkans.]]\n\nThe original Roman Senate continued to express decrees into the late 6th century, and the last Eastern Roman emperor to use [[Latin]] as the language of his court in Constantinople was emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], who reigned until 602. The overthrow of Maurice by his mutinying Danube army under [[Phocas]] resulted in the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and the decline of Balkan and Greek urban culture (leading to the flight of Balkan Latin speakers to the mountains, see [[Origin of the Romanians]]), and also provoked the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]] in which all the great eastern cities except Constantinople were lost. The resulting turmoil did not end until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century finalized the irreversible loss of all the largest Eastern Roman imperial cities besides the capital itself. The emperor [[Heraclius]] in [[Constantinople]], who emerged during this period, conducted his court in Greek, not Latin, though Greek had always been an administrative language of the eastern Roman regions. Eastern-Western links weakened with the ending of the [[Byzantine Papacy]].\n\nThe Eastern Roman empire's capital city of [[Constantinople]] was left as the only unconquered large urban center of the original Roman empire, as well as being the largest city in Europe. Over the next millennium the Roman culture of that city would slowly change, leading modern historians to refer to it by a new name, [[Byzantine]], though many classical books, sculptures, and technologies survived there along with classical Roman cuisine and scholarly traditions, well into the Middle Ages, when much of it was \"rediscovered\" by visiting Western crusaders. Indeed, the inhabitants of Constantinople continued to refer to themselves as Romans, as did their eventual conquerors in 1453, the [[Ottomans]]. (See [[R\u00fbm]] and [[Romaioi]].) The classical scholarship and culture that was still preserved in Constantinople were brought by refugees fleeing its conquest in 1453 and helped to spark the [[Renaissance]], see [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]].\n\nUltimately, it was a slow, complex, and graduated change in the socioeconomic structure in [[European history]] that led to the changeover between Classical Antiquity and Medieval society and no specific date can truly exemplify that.\n\n== Political revivalism==\n{{Further|Carolingian Renaissance|Ottonian Renaissance|Renaissance|Classicism|Legacy of the Roman Empire}}\n\nIn politics, the late Roman conception of the Empire as a universal state, headed by one supreme divinely-appointed ruler, united with Christianity as a universal religion likewise headed by a supreme [[patriarch]], proved very influential, even after the disappearance of imperial authority in the west. This tendency reached its peak when [[Charlemagne]] was [[Coronation|crowned]] \"Roman Emperor\" in the year 800, an act which led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The notion that an [[emperor]] is a [[monarch]] who outranks a mere king dates from this period. In this political ideal, there would always be a Roman Empire, a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized world.\n\nThat model continued to exist in Constantinople for the entirety of the Middle Ages; the [[Byzantine Emperor]] was considered the sovereign of the entire Christian world. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] was the Empire's highest-ranked cleric, but even he was subordinate to the Emperor, who was \"God's Vicegerent on Earth\". The Greek-speaking Byzantines and their descendants [[Romioi|continued to call themselves \"Romans\"]] until the creation of a new Greek state in 1832.\n\nAfter the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the Russian [[Czar of Russia|Czar]]s (a title derived from ''Caesar)'' claimed the Byzantine mantle as the champion of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]; [[Moscow]] was described as the \"[[Third Rome]]\" and the Czars ruled as divinely-appointed Emperors into the 20th century.\n\nDespite the fact that the Western Roman secular authority disappeared entirely in Europe, it still left traces. The [[Papacy]] and the [[Catholic Church]] in particular maintained Latin language, culture, and literacy for centuries; to this day the popes are called ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' which in the classical period was a title belonging to the Emperor, and the ideal of [[Christendom]] carried on the legacy of a united European civilization even after its political unity had disappeared.\n\nThe political idea of an Emperor in the West to match the Emperor in the East continued after the Western Roman Empire's collapse; it was revived by the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in&nbsp;800; the self-described [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled over central Europe until 1806.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] idea that the classical Roman virtues had been lost under medievalism was especially powerful in European politics of the 18th and 19th centuries. Reverence for Roman republicanism was strong among the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the Latin American revolutionaries; the Americans described their new government as a ''republic'' (from ''[[res publica]]'') and gave it a ''Senate'' and a ''President'' (another Latin term), rather than make use of available English terms like ''commonwealth'' or ''parliament''.\n\nSimilarly in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France, republicanism and Roman martial virtues were upheld by the state, as can be seen in the architecture of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. During the revolution, France itself followed the transition from kingdom to republic to dictatorship to Empire (complete with Imperial Eagles) that Rome had undergone centuries earlier.\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n{{Main|Classicism|Classical studies}}\n[[File:Sanzio 01 cropped.png|thumb|250px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] walking and disputing. Detail from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509\u20131511)]]\n''Classical antiquity'' is a broad term for a long period of cultural [[history]]. Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many rather disparate cultures and periods. \"Classical antiquity\" often refers to an idealized vision of later people, of what was, in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s words, <blockquote>\"the glory that was [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], the grandeur that was [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]!\" </blockquote>In the 18th and 19th centuries AD, reverence for classical antiquity was much greater in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] than it is today. Respect for the ancients of Greece and Rome affected [[politics]], [[philosophy]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[education]], and even [[architecture]] and [[History of sex|sexuality]].\n\n[[Epic poetry]] in [[Latin]] continued to be written and circulated well into the 19th century. [[John Milton]] and even [[Arthur Rimbaud]] received their first poetic educations in Latin. Genres like epic poetry, [[pastoral]] verse, and the endless use of characters and themes from [[Greek mythology]] left a deep mark on Western literature. In architecture, there have been several [[Greek Revival]]s, which seem more inspired in retrospect by Roman architecture than Greek. [[Washington, DC]] is filled with large [[marble]] buildings with facades made out to look like [[Roman temple]]s, with columns constructed in the [[classical orders],] of architecture.\n\nIn philosophy, the efforts of St [[Thomas Aquinas]] were derived largely from the thought of [[Aristotle]], despite the intervening change in [[religion]] from [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenic Polytheism]] to [[Christianity]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Greek and Roman authorities such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] formed the foundation of the practice of [[medicine]] even longer than Greek thought prevailed in philosophy. In the [[France|French]] [[theater]], [[tragedy|tragedians]] such as [[Moli\u00e8re]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the [[classical unities]] derived from Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. The desire to [[dance]] like a latter-day vision of how the ancient Greeks did it moved [[Isadora Duncan]] to create her brand of [[ballet]].\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Further|Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n{{Timeline of classical antiquity}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History|Ancient Greece|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Classical architecture]]\n* [[Classical tradition]]\n* [[Classics]] (Classical education)\n* [[Outline of classical studies]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Rome]]\n* [[Postclassical Era]] (the next period)\n\n; Regions during classical antiquity\n* [[Ancient history of Cyprus]]\n* [[Gaul]]\n* [[Hellenistic Greece]]\n* [[History of the Balkans]]\n* [[Roman Britain]]\n* [[Roman Dacia]]\n* [[Troy]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Grinin L.

He is the fourth Greek Prime Minister who has governed in the course of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|2010s government-debt crisis]]. Originally an outspoken critic of the austerity policies implemented during the crisis, his tenure in office has been marked by an intense austerity policy, mostly in the context of the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third EU bailout to Greece]] (2015\u20132018).\n\nTsipras was born in [[Athens]] in 1974. He joined the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] in the late 1980s and in the 1990s was politically active in student protests against education reform plans, becoming the movement's spokesperson. He studied civil engineering at the [[National Technical University of Athens]], graduating in 2000, later undertaking post-graduate studies in urban and regional planning. He worked as a civil engineer in the construction industry, based primarily in Athens.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Tsipras served as the secretary of [[Synaspismos Youth]]. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee of [[Synaspismos]] in 2004 and later the Political Secretariat. In the 2006 local election, he ran as [[Syriza]]'s candidate for [[List of mayors of Athens|Mayor of Athens]], winning 10.5%. In 2008, he was elected as Leader of Syriza, succeeding [[Alekos Alavanos]]. He was first elected to the [[Hellenic Parliament]] representing [[Athens A]] in the 2009 election and was re-elected in May and June 2012, subsequently becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (Greece)|Leader of the Opposition]] and appointing his own shadow cabinet.\n\nIn January 2015, Tsipras led Syriza to victory in a [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|snap legislative election]], winning 149 out of 300 seats in the Hellenic Parliament and forming a coalition with the [[Independent Greeks]]. On 20 August 2015, seven months into his term as prime minister he lost his majority after intraparty defections, announced his resignation, and called for a snap election to take place the following month. In the [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|September 2015 election]] that followed, Tsipras led Syriza to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks.

He is the fourth Greek Prime Minister who has governed in the course of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|2010s government-debt crisis]]. Originally an outspoken critic of the austerity policies implemented during the crisis, his tenure in office has been marked by an intense austerity policy, mostly in the context of the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third EU bailout to Greece]] (2015\u20132018).\n\nTsipras was born in [[Athens]] in 1974. He joined the [[Communist Youth of Greece]] in the late 1980s and in the 1990s was politically active in student protests against education reform plans, becoming the movement's spokesperson. He studied civil engineering at the [[National Technical University of Athens]], graduating in 2000, later undertaking post-graduate studies in urban and regional planning. He worked as a civil engineer in the construction industry, based primarily in Athens.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2003, Tsipras served as the secretary of [[Synaspismos Youth]]. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee of [[Synaspismos]] in 2004 and later the Political Secretariat. In the 2006 local election, he ran as [[Syriza]]'s candidate for [[List of mayors of Athens|Mayor of Athens]], winning 10.5%. In 2008, he was elected as Leader of Syriza, succeeding [[Alekos Alavanos]]. He was first elected to the [[Hellenic Parliament]] representing [[Athens A]] in the 2009 election and was re-elected in May and June 2012, subsequently becoming [[Leader of the Opposition (Greece)|Leader of the Opposition]] and appointing his own shadow cabinet.\n\nIn January 2015, Tsipras led Syriza to victory in a [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|snap legislative election]], winning 149 out of 300 seats in the Hellenic Parliament and forming a coalition with the [[Independent Greeks]]. On 20 August 2015, seven months into his term as prime minister he lost his majority after intraparty defections, announced his resignation, and called for a snap election to take place the following month. In the [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|September 2015 election]] that followed, Tsipras led Syriza to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks. During his premiership, he has overseen negotiations regarding the [[Greek government-debt crisis]], initiated the [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|Greek bailout referendum]] and responded to the [[European migrant crisis]].

It was the main residence of the emperors of the [[Mughal Dynasty]] until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to [[Delhi]]. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Agra Fort - World HeritageCentre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/251|website= UNESCO.ORG}}</ref> It is about 2.5&nbsp;km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\n\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as ''Badalgarh.'' It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the [[Chauhan]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]] occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when [[Sikandar Lodi]] (A.D. 1487&ndash;1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra.

It is 5 feet high, 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet in circumference. On the external side of the rim there is an inscription in Persian which mentions it as ''<nowiki/>'Hauz-e-Jahangir''<nowiki/>'. It was first discovered near the courtyard of Akbar's palace. In A.D. 1843 and later it was placed in front of Diwan-e-Am. In 1862, it was shifted to public garden (Company Bagh) where it suffered much damage. Later, Sir John Marshall brought it back to Agra Fort and placed there. Due to this hauz, the palace became famous as Jahangiri Mahal though it is part of Akbar's Bengali mahal.\n* '''Shahjahani Mahal''' (1628-35 A.D.): It is situated in between the white marble Khas Mahal and the red stone Jahangiri Mahal and is set transitionally in between these two residential complexes of two different ages. It is the earliest attempt of the Mughal emperor Shahjahan to convert an existing red stone building in accordance with his taste and it was his earliest palace in Agra Fort. It has a large hall, side rooms and an octagonal tower on the riverside. The skeletal construction of brick and red stone was all redone with a thick white stucco plaster and colourfully painted in floral designs. The whole palace once glistened white like white marble. On the face towards the Khas Mahal, is a large spacious white marble dalan, composed of five arches, supported on double pillars and protected externally by a chhajja. Its closed western bay houses, the Ghaznin gate, Babur's baoli and a well are situated beneath it. \n*'''Ghaznin Gate''' (1030 A.D.): The gate originally belonged to the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi at Ghazni. It was brought from there by the British in1842. Lord Ellenborough, the Governor General, in historic proclamation claimed, that these were the sandalwood gates of Somnath which Mahmud had taken to Ghazni in 1025, and the British had thus avenged an insult of 800 years back. This false claim was made just to win the goodwill of the Indian people. The gate is, in fact, made of local deodar wood of Ghazni and not of sandalwood. The style of decoration bears no resemblance to ancient Gujrati woodwork. There is also an Arabic inscription carved on the upper part. It mentions Mahmud with his epithets. Sir John Marshall had placed here a notice-board which described the whole episode about this gate. It is 16.5 feet high and 13.5 feet broad and its wight is about half a ton. It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room. \n*'''Jahangir's Chain of Justice''' (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\n*'''The Muthamman Burj''' (Shah-Burj) & '''Jharokha''' (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\n*'''Shish Mahal''' (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.  \n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Agra Fort won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2004. [[India Post]] issued a stamp to commemorate this event.\n*The Agra Fort plays a key role in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] mystery ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'', by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].\n*The Agra Fort was featured in the music video for [[Habibi Da]], a hit song of Egyptian [[Celebrity|pop star]] [[Hisham Abbas]].\n*[[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] came to Agra in 1666 as per the \"[[Treaty of Purandar (1665)]]\" entered into with [[Mirza Raje Jaisingh]] to meet [[Aurangzeb]] in the [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]. In the audience, he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. Insulted, he stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to [[Jai Sing]]'s quarters on 12 May 1666.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Map of Agra Fort.jpg|Plan of Agra Fort on display at the fort, 2012\nFile:Diwan-E-Aam (Hall of Public Audience).jpg|Exterior of Diwan-i-Am or Hall of Public Audience\nFile:Diwan-i-Aam Hallways.jpg|Interior of Diwan I Am (Hall of Public Audience)\nFile:Diwan-i-Am-1.jpg|Agra Fort Diwan I Am (Hall of Public Audience)\nFile:Amar Singh Gate, Agra.jpg|Amar Singh Gate, Agra\nFile:Agra Fort 13.JPG|Jahangir Palace\nFile:Agra Fort 20.jpg|Diwan-i-Khas\nFile:Delhi gate 6.jpg|Delhi gate, by Seeta Ram, 1814\u201315\nFile:Agrafortushnish2.jpg|Agra Fort insides\nFile:AgraFortColumn.jpg|Decorated column\nFile:Agrafortushnish3.jpg|Decorations on the ceiling\nFile:Weeks Edwin Gate Of The Fortress At Agra India.jpg|Weeks Edwin Gate of the Fortress at Agra India\nFile:Inside Red Fort, Agra.jpg|Inside the Fort's extensive compound\nFile:Agra Fort Rempart.jpg|Rampart of Agra Fort\nFile:Bathtub of Jahangir.jpg|Bathtub of Jahangir\nFile:Taj and jamuna river from Agra Fort.jpg|Taj and Yamuna river\nFile:Agra fort, Agra, India.jpg|Musamman Burj inside\nFile:Agra Fort Anguri Bagh (side view)-Agra-Uttar Pradesh-N-UP-A1-b.jpg|Anguri Bagh, the garden in the courtyard\nFile:Agra Fort Shish Mahal-Agra-Uttar Pradesh-N-UP-A1-y.jpg|Agra Fort: Shish Mahal\nFile:Agra Fort John Russell Colvin's Tomb-Agra-Uttar Pradesh-N-UP-A1-i.jpg|Agra Fort: Hon'ble John Russell Colvin's Tomb.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jama Masjid, Agra|Jama Masjid]]\n* [[Fatehpur Sikri]]\n* [[Lahore Fort]]\n* [[Red Fort]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Agra Fort}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Agra|Agra Fort}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091203060952/http://www.asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_agrafort.asp Agra Fort (1983), Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Archaeological Survey of India]\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/agrafort/maps/maps.html Agra Fort map] (from Murray's travel guide, 1909)\n*{{Osmway|310318567}}\n\n{{World Heritage Sites in India}}\n\n[[Category:Agra Fort| ]]\n[[Category:Akbar]]\n[[Category:Islamic architecture]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|UNESCO World Heritage site in India}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = Agra Fort\n| image = Agra 03-2016 10 Agra Fort.jpg\n| image_size = 300\n| caption = Entry gates of the Agra Fort\n| type = \n| coordinates = \n| location = [[Agra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], North India\n| area = {{convert|94|acre}}\n| built = 1565-1573\n| built_for = [[Akbar]]\n| architecture = Mughal\n| governing_body = \n| owner = * [[Lodhi Dynasty]]  (1504-1526)\n*[[Mughal Empire]] (1526\u20131540)\n*[[Suri Dynasty]] (1540\u20131555)\n*[[Mughal Empire]] (1556\u20131785)\n*[[Maratha Empire]] (1785\u20131803)\n*[[British Empire]] (1803\u20131947)\n| embedded = \n{{Infobox UNESCO World Heritage Site\n| child         = yes\n| criteria      = {{UNESCO WHS type|(iii)}}(iii)\n| ID            = 251\n| coordinates   = {{Coord|27.179542|N|78.021101|E|display=title,inline|format=dms}}\n| year          = 1984\n| area          = <!-- {{convert|...|ha|sqmi|abbr=on}} or similar with other units recommended -->\n| buffer_zone   = \n| locmapin      = Uttar Pradesh#India\n| map_caption   = \n}}\n}}\n'''Agra Fort''' is a historical [[fort]] in the city of [[Agra]] in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the [[Mughal Dynasty]] until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to [[Delhi]]. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Agra Fort - World HeritageCentre|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/251|website= UNESCO.ORG}}</ref> It is about 2.5&nbsp;km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the [[Taj Mahal]]. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.\n\nIt had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as ''Badalgarh.'' It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the [[Chauhan]] [[Rajput|Rajputs]] occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when [[Sikandar Lodi]] (A.D. 1487&ndash;1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, [[Humayun]] was crowned in it.

It is made up of geometrical, hexagonal and octagonal panels which have been fixed, one with the help of the other into the frame without rivets. The idea to restore it at Somnath was ultimately given up and the gate was abandoned. Since then, it is stored in a room. \n*'''Jahangir's Chain of Justice''' (C. 1605 A.D.): This is the spot where Mughal king Jahangir instituted his 'chain of justice'(Zanjir-i-Adl) in c. 1605 A.D. He records in his memoir that after his accession, the first order he gave, \"was for the fastening up of the chain of justice so that if those engaged in the administration of justice should delay or practice hypocrisy, the aggrieved might come to this chain and shake it so that its noise might attract my attention.\" It was made of pure gold. It was 80' in length and had 60 bells. Its weight was 1 Quintal. One end was fastened to the battlements of the Shah-Burj and the other end to a stone post on the bank of the river. This is not a myth. Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins personally saw it. It has also been depicted in a contemporary painting made in 1620 A.D. This was a way to redress the grievances of the people who could approach the king, the highest judicial authority of the empire, directly, without fee, fear or formality for immediate relief. There was no distinction of caste or creed or between poor and rich. Jahangir's administration of justice 'Adl-i-Jahangir' became a legend in Indian history.\n*'''The Muthamman Burj''' (Shah-Burj) & '''Jharokha''' (1632 -1640 A.D.): This beautiful palace surmounts the largest bastion of Agra Fort on the riverside, facing the East. It was originally built of red stone by Akbar who used it for jharokha darshan, as well as for sun worship, everyday at sunrise. Jehangir also used it as jharokha, as is faithfully shown in his painting made in 1620. He also instituted his 'Adl-i-Janjir'(the chain of justice) on its south side. Owing to its octagonal plan, it was called 'Muthamman Burj'. It has also been mentioned as 'Shah-Burj'(the imperial or king's tower) by Persian historians and foreign travellers. Its name jasmine tower or 'Samman-Burj' as recorded by the contemporary historian Lahauri is a misnomer. It was rebuilt with white marble by Shah Jehan around 1632-1640 A.D. He also used it for jharokha darshan which was an indispensable a Mughal institution as was 'Durbar'. It is an octagonal building, five external sides of which make a dalan overlooking the river. Each side has pillar and bracket openings, the eastern most side projects forward and accommodates a jharokha majestically. On the western side of this palace is a spacious dalan with Shah-Nasin (alcoves). A shallow water-basin (kunda) is sunk in its pavement. It is profusely inlaid. This dalan opens on a court which has a chabutara projected by a jali screen, on its northern side, a series of rooms leading to Shish Mahal on its western side; and a colonnade (dalan) with a room attached to its on the southern side. It is, thus, a large complex entirely built of white marble. It has deep niches on the walls, to break the monotony. Dados have repetitive stylized creepers inlaid on borders and carved plants on the centre pillars, brackets and lintels also bear exquisitely inlaid designs and it is one of the most ornamented buildings of Shah Jehan. This palace is directly connected to the Diwan-i-Khas, Shish Mahal, Khas Mahal, and other palaces. and it was from here that the Mughal emperor governed the whole country. This burj offers full and majestic view of Taj Mahal and Shah Jehan spent eight years (1658-1666 A.D.) of his imprisonment in this complex, and it is said that he died here. His body was taken by boat to the Taj Mahal and buried.\n*'''Shish Mahal''' (A.D. 1631-40): It was built by Mughal Emperor Shahjahan as a part of summer palace. Its most distinctive feature is glass mosaic work done on its walls and ceiling. These glass pieces have high mirror quality which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways in semi-dark interior. The glass was imported from Haleb of Syria. Shahjahan built glass palace also at Lahore and Delhi, but this is the finest of all.  \n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Agra Fort won the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2004.
