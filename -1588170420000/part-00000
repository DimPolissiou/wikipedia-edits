In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

In 2000, she moved to [[Vienna]] to start a career as a free visual artist. In the years that followed she primarily worked in [[Berlin]]. Since 2011, Hana Usui has lived and worked in Vienna (Austria) and Bolzano-Bozen (Italy). Her [[drawing]]s are made of black or white oil paint, which she carves into paper with a screwdriver and often embeds into ink washes.<ref>[http://www.hana-usui.net/mediapool/24/241994/data/Usui_Cat_2012.pdf \"Hana Usui. Drawings 2006-2012\"], Retrieved on 2014 January 14.</ref>\n\n\"The works of the Japanese artist Hana Usui, who was born in Tokyo in 1974, are, however restrained, of great complexity. This is true of the relationship of oil drawing and ink painting (or photography), of the combination of drawing and painting techniques, of linear conciseness and spaciousness. The resulting richness of levels of expression also characterises the critical works that have dominated in recent years. Those on the history of her own country, on Fukushima or Hiroshima, give the subject a new dimension by avoiding anything striking or the purely documentary and are never to be seen as a political manifesto. Thanks to this distancing and mere suggestion and the symbolic in the artistic media, they gain, one might say, in quiet intensity and at the same time remain open to questions. In this way, freed of their historical context, warning and appeal demonstrate their enduring validity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_kuenstler/index.html|title=Quote from the newsletter of the Dittmar Gallery on April 9, 2020 |website=www.galerie-dittmar.at|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions==\n* 2019 Vienna Art Week: ''Bei Uns'' (Around Here), WOP - Works on Paper, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/103368/hana-usui-bei-uns|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wopwien.com/wop/hana-usui\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.wopwien.com|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viennaartweek.at/de/program/\n|title=Bei Uns - WOP|website=www.viennaartweek.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''An das Leben'' (To Life), Artcurial Austria, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esel.at/termin/98220|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.esel.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kekinwien.at/kunst/09/2018/hana-usui-an-das-leben/|title=An das Leben - Artcurial|website=www.kekinwien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2018 ''Black End'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101412;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Black End - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2016 ''High & Slow'', with Thilo Westermann, Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de/ausstellungen/high-slow/|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.kunsthaus-kaufbeuren.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/ausstellung-kuenste-der-verfeinerung-1.3192064|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.sueddeutsche.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/101413;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=High & Slow - Kunsthaus Kaufbeuren|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Schwarzer Regen'' (Black Rain), Bildraum 01, Vienna / AT<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bildrecht.at/bildraum/bildraum-01/hana-usui-schwarzer-regen/|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.bildrecht.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/90838;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Schwarzer Regen - Bildraum 01|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/!5236630/ |title=Works on Paper - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.taz.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2015 ''Hana Usui - Works on Paper'', Galerie Daniela and Cora H\u00f6lzl - EY5, D\u00fcsseldorf / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de/current%20exhibition.htm|title=Works on Paper - Galerie Cora H\u00f6lzl|website=www.galerie-cora-hoelzl.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2013 '' Hana Usui - Drawings'', Galerie Dittmar, Berlin / DE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galerie-dittmar.de/_ausstellung/index.html|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.galerie-dittmar.de|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/86712;jsessionid=AA0A80BDAE4D46885F218D98C6AA5B3A?wicket:pageMapName=orgLukas|title=Drawings - Galerie Dittmar|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n* 2012 Vienna Art Week: ''Hana Usui.

In describing her relationship with the character, she said, \"They liked to see a woman feeling guilty and I didn't like that ... I think [Nyborg] should be responsible for her feelings. And when she has to make unsympathetic decisions, she should stand by them. I don't want her to feel sorry for herself or suddenly become a soppy mess in her private life, because you wouldn't believe her as a prime minister if she did that.\"<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9042669/Borgen-Sidse-Babett-Knudsen-interview.html \"Borgen: Sidse Babett Knudsen interview\", ''The Telegraph'', 27 Jan 2012].

In the first episode, Birgitte is the leader of a minority [[political party]], the \"Moderates\". However, as a result of a sequence of events following a closely fought [[general election]], she finds herself a compromise candidate for the role of [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] and remains in this position until the end of the second series.

By tracing the contacts of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, public health aims to reduce infections in the population. Diseases for which contact tracing is commonly performed for include [[tuberculosis]], vaccine-preventable infections like [[measles]], sexually transmitted infections (including [[HIV]]), blood-borne infections, some serious bacterial infections, and novel infections (e.g. [[SARS-CoV]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]]). \nThe goals of contact tracing are:  N om.

The eradication of [[smallpox]], for example, was achieved not by universal immunization, but by exhaustive contact tracing to find all infected persons.<ref name=\"Scutchfield\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fwlj4jWC5A4C |title=Principles of public health practice |last=Scutchfield |first=F.

By tracing the contacts of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts in turn, public health aims to reduce infections in the population. Diseases for which contact tracing is commonly performed for include [[tuberculosis]], vaccine-preventable infections like [[measles]], sexually transmitted infections (including [[HIV]]), blood-borne infections, some serious bacterial infections, and novel infections (e.g. [[SARS-CoV]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]]). \nThe goals of contact tracing are: \n\n* To interrupt ongoing transmission and reduce spread of an infection\n* To alert contacts to the possibility of infection and offer preventive counseling or prophylactic care\n* To offer diagnosis, counseling and treatment to already infected individuals\n* If the infection is treatable, to help prevent reinfection of the originally infected patient\n* To learn about the epidemiology of a disease in a particular population\n\nContact tracing has been a pillar of communicable disease control in public health for decades.
