A 30-minute photo of a static object and surrounding cannot be distinguished from a short exposure, hence, the inclusion of motion is the main factor to add intrigue to long exposure photos. Images with exposure times of several minutes also tend to make moving people or dark objects disappear (because they are in any one spot for only a fraction of the exposure time), often adding a serene and otherworldly appearance to long exposure photos.\n\nWhen a scene includes both stationary and moving subjects (for example, a fixed street and moving cars or a camera within a car showing a fixed dashboard and moving scenery), a slow shutter speed can cause interesting effects, such as light trails.\n\nLong exposures are easiest to accomplish in low-light conditions but can be done in brighter light using [[neutral density filter]]s or specially designed cameras. When using a dense neutral density filter your camera's auto focus will not be able to function. It is best to compose and focus without the filter. Then once you are happy with the composition, switch to manual focus and put the neutral density filter back on.<ref>[http://digital-photography-school.com/8-tips-for-long-exposure-photography/] 8 Tips for long exposure photography.

For the first time this series, Return performances were absent for the entire season.\n\nThe season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>. The series will end on the live finale airing April 24, 2020.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

''Singer 2020'' is produced by Hong Tao, and its music director is Hong Kong senior musician [[Kubert Leung]].

For the first time this series, Return performances were absent for the entire season.\n\nThe season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>. The series will end on the live finale airing April 24, 2020.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

He attended [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry Officer Training]] and was then selected to attend the U.S. Army's [[Ranger School]]. Behenna was assigned to the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] as the platoon leader for 5th Platoon, Delta Company of the 1st Battalion, [[327th Infantry Regiment]] and deployed to [[Iraq]] in 2007.<ref name=starsandstripes>{{cite web |title=Hearing on Iraq detainee death case postponed |author=Joseph Giordono |publisher=Stars and Stripes |url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=56836}}</ref>\n\nDuring his tour of duty in Iraq, Behenna's platoon conducted counterinsurgency operations in the [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salahuddin]] province with a focus on the towns of Mezra, [[Hajaj]] and Butoma. Behenna made efforts to develop ties with local Iraqis as part of his counter-insurgency mission and, already fluent in Spanish, began to teach himself Arabic. He was known to host cookouts with his platoon for local interpreters, engage with civilians on the street and encouraged his soldiers to learn about Iraqi culture and to eat their food. This desire to interact with locals caused some friction within his platoon, with one soldier commenting: \n<blockquote>\nHe would talk to random civilians, anyone. He was the type of guy that liked Iraqis. That was the only annoying thing about him. He was always about saving the country.<ref name=latimes1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Behenna's platoon was returning to their base with two detainees when their convoy was hit by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. One of the platoon's [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAPs]] was destroyed and two soldiers, [[Specialist (rank)|Specialists]] Adam Kohlhaas and Steven Christofferson, were killed and several others grievously wounded. The loss of his men weighed heavily on Behenna who at one point broke down in tears over the incident during a group therapy session.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nOn May 5, Behenna received information on a man suspected by military intelligence to be working for [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], which they believed was responsible for the April 21 attack. Acting on this intelligence, Behenna's platoon raided a house in Butoma where they found the man identified by military intelligence, Ali Mansur Mohamed, along with a cache of ammunition, an [[RPK]] light machine gun and a passport with Syrian visas. After securing Mansur and collecting the arms cache, Behenna's platoon returned to base with Mansur and turned him over to military intelligence agents for questioning.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nLess than two weeks later, Mansur was ordered released due to military intelligence having insufficient evidence to hold him any longer. Behenna's platoon was tasked with the return of Mansur to town as soon as possible. On May 16, while returning the prisoner to a checkpoint as ordered, Behenna and his platoon stopped at a bridge in the northern oil refinery town of [[Baiji, Iraq|Baiji]] and, with the help of his Iraqi interpreter, nicknamed \"Harry\",<ref name=latimes2/> tried to question Mansur on the April 21 attacks. According to the interpreter:\n{{quote|\nLieutenant Behenna started talking with Ali Mansur and Sergeant Warner followed them.<br>\nBehenna and Warner started taking off Ali Mansur's clothes with their knives.<br>\nThey then cut his handcuffs.<br>\nAli Mansur said I will talk to you<br>\nbut Lieutenant Behenna pulled trigger and killed him<br>\nBefore we started the patrol,<br>\nLieutenant Behenna told to Ali Mansur 'I will kill you'.<br>\nI thought Lieutenant Behenna was trying to scare him.<br>\nI did not think he would go through<br>\nI was standing 10 metres back during the shooting<br>\nI could see everything even if it was getting dark<br>\nand Sergeant Warner was next to me.<br>\nHe took the grenade from his pocket, pulled the safety ring, walked around<br>\nand put the grenade under Ali Mansur's head.<br>\nThen they hid his clothes, and Behenna and Warner went back.<br>\n|Harry}}\n\nTwo U.S. soldiers from the same battalion as the accused also testified against Warner. Corporal Cody Atkinson said that Behenna and Warner, armed with a grenade, took Mansur out of the vehicle and under the bridge, and that \"Warner told us to write that Ali Mansur had been released\". Sergeant Milton Sanchez said Behenna \"did not think that we should release him\".<ref>{{cite web |website=Google.com |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxttv8obWP1hPI7P-xY_fUMRMvag |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701110140/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxttv8obWP1hPI7P-xY_fUMRMvag |archive-date=1 July 2012 |title=Prosecutors want US soldier court martialled over Iraq murder |date=14 September 2008 |author=AFP |quote=Corporal Cody Atkinson said that Behenna and Warner, armed with a grenade, took Mohammed out of the vehicle and under the bridge.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Behenna, his actions were in self-defense and he describes the situation as such in an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news9.com/story/25073872/michael-behenna-reflects-on-his-incarceration-release |website=news9.com |date=25 March 2014 |title=Michael Behenna Reflects On His Incarceration, Release |quote=Behenna said he was field-questioning Ali Monsur about an attack on his platoon and al-Qaeda's operations when Monsur came at him. \"He throws a piece of concrete and it hits right by my head, and by the time I turned around to look, he stood up,\" recalled Behenna. \"He stood up like he's coming at me, so I'm thinking he's gonna take my weapon or and use it on me, so I instinctively shoot and I shot twice.\" The incident landed Behenna behind bars at Fort Leavenworth despite Behenna's claim he acted in self-defense.}}</ref>\n\nAfter the killing, Behenna ordered the platoon back to the base and the next day local villagers found Mansur's naked, burned body in the culvert. On July 31, 2008, Behenna was relieved of his command and charged with the premeditated murder of Ali Mansur Mohamed. In November 2008, Behenna was returned to [[Fort Campbell]] and assigned to security duties pending a court-martial.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\n==Court-martial==\nAfter Behenna's [[Article 32 hearing]], his family hired defense attorney Jack Zimmerman, a former United States Marine, military trial judge and Vietnam veteran. The prosecution, led by Captain Erwin Roberts, made its opening statements on February 23, 2009. The prosecution's two principal witnesses were Iraqi interpreter \"Harry\" and Staff Sergeant Warner.

Behenna was assigned to the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] as the platoon leader for 5th Platoon, Delta Company of the 1st Battalion, [[327th Infantry Regiment]] and deployed to [[Iraq]] in 2007.<ref name=starsandstripes>{{cite web |title=Hearing on Iraq detainee death case postponed |author=Joseph Giordono |publisher=Stars and Stripes |url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=56836}}</ref>\n\nDuring his tour of duty in Iraq, Behenna's platoon conducted counterinsurgency operations in the [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salahuddin]] province with a focus on the towns of Mezra, [[Hajaj]] and Butoma. Behenna made efforts to develop ties with local Iraqis as part of his counter-insurgency mission and, already fluent in Spanish, began to teach himself Arabic. He was known to host cookouts with his platoon for local interpreters, engage with civilians on the street and encouraged his soldiers to learn about Iraqi culture and to eat their food. This desire to interact with locals caused some friction within his platoon, with one soldier commenting: \n<blockquote>\nHe would talk to random civilians, anyone. He was the type of guy that liked Iraqis. That was the only annoying thing about him. He was always about saving the country.<ref name=latimes1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Behenna's platoon was returning to their base with two detainees when their convoy was hit by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. One of the platoon's [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAPs]] was destroyed and two soldiers, [[Specialist (rank)|Specialists]] Adam Kohlhaas and Steven Christofferson, were killed and several others grievously wounded. The loss of his men weighed heavily on Behenna who at one point broke down in tears over the incident during a group therapy session.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nOn May 5, Behenna received information on a man suspected by military intelligence to be working for [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], which they believed was responsible for the April 21 attack. Acting on this intelligence, Behenna's platoon raided a house in Butoma where they found the man identified by military intelligence, Ali Mansur Mohamed, along with a cache of ammunition, an [[RPK]] light machine gun and a passport with Syrian visas. After securing Mansur and collecting the arms cache, Behenna's platoon returned to base with Mansur and turned him over to military intelligence agents for questioning.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nLess than two weeks later, Mansur was ordered released due to military intelligence having insufficient evidence to hold him any longer. Behenna's platoon was tasked with the return of Mansur to town as soon as possible. On May 16, while returning the prisoner to a checkpoint as ordered, Behenna and his platoon stopped at a bridge in the northern oil refinery town of [[Baiji, Iraq|Baiji]] and, with the help of his Iraqi interpreter, nicknamed \"Harry\",<ref name=latimes2/> tried to question Mansur on the April 21 attacks. According to the interpreter:\n{{quote|\nLieutenant Behenna started talking with Ali Mansur and Sergeant Warner followed them.<br>\nBehenna and Warner started taking off Ali Mansur's clothes with their knives.<br>\nThey then cut his handcuffs.<br>\nAli Mansur said I will talk to you<br>\nbut Lieutenant Behenna pulled trigger and killed him<br>\nBefore we started the patrol,<br>\nLieutenant Behenna told to Ali Mansur 'I will kill you'.<br>\nI thought Lieutenant Behenna was trying to scare him.<br>\nI did not think he would go through<br>\nI was standing 10 metres back during the shooting<br>\nI could see everything even if it was getting dark<br>\nand Sergeant Warner was next to me.<br>\nHe took the grenade from his pocket, pulled the safety ring, walked around<br>\nand put the grenade under Ali Mansur's head.<br>\nThen they hid his clothes, and Behenna and Warner went back.<br>\n|Harry}}\n\nTwo U.S. soldiers from the same battalion as the accused also testified against Warner. Corporal Cody Atkinson said that Behenna and Warner, armed with a grenade, took Mansur out of the vehicle and under the bridge, and that \"Warner told us to write that Ali Mansur had been released\".

Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first small jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=International Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[McDonnell Aircraft]] both began development of UCX aircraft, while [[North American Aviation]] pursued the UTX requirement.<ref name=Flying1987>{{cite news |last=Peter |first=Garrison |title=BABY BIZJET BOOM: The birth of the light jet. |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=September 1987 |pages=124\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]] had a [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|7650|lb|t}}, initially powered by two [[Turbom\u00e9ca Marbor\u00e9]] [[turbojet]]s of {{convert|880|lbf|kN}} thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to {{convert|1058|lbf|kN}} units.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[McDonnell Aircraft]] both began development of UCX aircraft, while [[North American Aviation]] pursued the UTX requirement.<ref name=Flying1987>{{cite news |last=Peter |first=Garrison |title=BABY BIZJET BOOM: The birth of the light jet. |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=September 1987 |pages=124\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]] had a [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|7650|lb|t}}, initially powered by two [[Turbom\u00e9ca Marbor\u00e9]] [[turbojet]]s of {{convert|880|lbf|kN}} thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to {{convert|1058|lbf|kN}} units. The aircraft seated a single pilot and up to three passengers under a sliding canopy, and was first flown on 29 July 1954. 219 were built.\n\n[[File:NASA JetStar.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed JetStar]] is the earliest business jet with a center aisle]]\n\nThe [[Lockheed JetStar]], designed to meet USAF UCX requirements and seating ten passengers and two crew, first flew on 4 September 1957. A total of 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four {{convert|3300|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] [[turbojet]]s, then [[Garrett TFE731]] turbofans for a {{convert|44500|lb|t}} [[MTOW]], then two [[General Electric CF700]] turbofans.\n\nThe smaller, {{convert|17760|lb|t}} MTOW [[North American Sabreliner]], tailored to the USAF UTX requirement, first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\nDesigned in 1957 for the UCX requirement, the [[McDonnell 119]] was delayed by the cancellation of the [[Fairchild J83]] engine program, and first flew on 11 February 1959 powered by four [[Westinghouse J34]] turbojets. The 119 was certified for a {{convert|45328|lb|t|1}} MTOW with four Pratt & Whitney JT12 or General Electric CF700 engines, but no firm orders were received, and only the single prototype was completed.<ref name=Francillon1990>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Francillon |first=Ren\u00e9 |date=1990 |title=McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Since 1920 |volume=II  |location=Annapolis, Maryland |publisher=Naval Institute Press |pages=241\u2013243 |isbn=1-55750-550-0 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300]] turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the [[Hawker 800]], were produced between 1962 and 2013.\n\nThe Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the [[IAI Westwind]], first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CJ610]] turbojets, then [[Garrett TFE731]]s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MTOW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012. It was followed by the shorter [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Legacy 450]] on 28 December 2013.\n\n=== New models ===\n[[File:Bombardier Global 7500 on static display, EBACE 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex (BL7C0578).jpg|thumb|A [[Global 7500]] prototype in 2018]]\nAfter peaking in 2008, deliveries slowed due to [[political instability]] but the industry hopes to revive demand by introducing more attractive and competitive new models, four in 2018:<ref name=AvWeek22dec2017>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/new-models-enter-market-where-can-business-aviation-go-next |title= As New Models Enter Market, Where Can Business Aviation Go Next? |at= New models stimulate demand, but it is getting harder to find a niche to target |date= 22 December 2017 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|7,400|nmi|km}} range [[Bombardier Global 7500]] large-cabin jet, before the {{cvt|7,900|nmi|km}} Global 8000 in 2019;\n* the {{cvt|5,200|nmi|km}} large-cabin [[Gulfstream G500]], replacing the [[Gulfstream G450]], then the longer, {{cvt|6,500|nmi|km}} G600 eventually superseding the [[G550]];\n* the {{cvt|3,500|nmi|km}} [[Cessna Citation Longitude]] super midsize jet;\n* the superlight [[Pilatus PC-24]].\n\nIn October 2018, consultant Jetcraft expected 20 variants or new designs to enter service before 2023 (seven large, seven midsize and six small):\nin 2019 the [[Bombardier Global Express#Global 5500/6500|Global 5500/6500]], [[Gulfstream G600]], [[Citation XLS]]++ and a [[Cessna CitationJet/M2|CitationJet CJ4+]]/, while the [[Embraer Legacy 500|Embraer Praetor 500/600]] to be introduced in 2019 were predicted for 2021/2022;\nin 2020 a [[Gulfstream G750]];\nin 2021 the [[Dassault Falcon 6X]], [[Learjet 70]]XR/75XR and [[Global 7500]]XR;\nin 2022 the [[Bombardier Challenger 350|Bombardier Challenger 350XRS]];\nin 2023 the [[Citation Hemisphere]], an [[Embraer Legacy]] 700, [[Phenom 100]]V+, [[Dassault Falcon]] 9X, [[Bombardier Challenger 750]] and Gulfstream G400NG;\nin 2025 a [[Citation Mustang]] 2+.<ref name=AvWeek15oct2018>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/nbaa-2018/20-new-business-jets-way-says-jetcraft |title= 20 New Business Jets on the Way, Says Jetcraft |date= Oct 15, 2018 |author= John Morris |work= Aviation Week Network}}</ref>\n\n== Configuration ==\n\nThough the early [[Lockheed Jetstar]] had four, most production business jets have two [[jet engine]]s, mostly rear-mounted [[podded engine]].

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.
