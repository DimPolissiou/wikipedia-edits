During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates). Socially they were not a distinct class from the rycerstwo from which they all originated<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\">{{cite book\n | last = Dmowski\n | first = Roman Stanis\u0142aw\n | authorlink = Roman Dmowski\n | editor-last = Duff\n | editor-first = James Duff\n | editor-link = James Duff Duff\n | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/RussianRealitiesAndProblems\n | title = RUSSIAN REALITIES & PROBLEMS\n | year = 1917\n | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n | location = Cambridge, East of England, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM\n | page = 94\n | chapter = Poland, Old And New\n | quote = But between the gentry and the magnates there was only a difference of wealth and culture.

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence. These mo\u017cni (Magnates) constantly sought to undermine princely authority.<ref name=\"davies--norman\" />{{rp|75, 76}} In [[Gallus Anonymus|Gall Anonym's]] chronicle, there is noted the nobility's alarm when the [[Count palatine|Palatine]] [[Sieciech]] \"elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born\" entrusting them with state offices. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=149}}\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n{{Main|Lithuanian nobility}}\n[[File:Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jogaila (W\u0142adys\u0142aw II)]]]]\nIn [[Lithuania Propria]] and in [[Samogitia]], prior to the creation of the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]] by [[Mindaugas]], nobles were called ''die beste leuten'' in [[German language|German]] sources. In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected. Major effects on the lesser Lithuanian nobility occurred after various sanctions were imposed by the [[Russian Empire]], such as removing ''Lithuania'' from the names of the ''Gubernyas'' shortly after the [[November Uprising]].<ref name=\"Ochma\u0144ski\">{{cite book |last=Ochma\u0144ski |first=Jerzy |title=The National Idea in Lithuania from the 16th to the First Half of the 19th Century: The Problem of Cultural-Linguistic Differentiation |publisher=Mickiewicz University |year=1986 |location=Pozna\u0144}}</ref> After the [[January Uprising]] the sanctions went further, and Russian officials announced that \"Lithuanians were actually Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism\" and began to intensify [[Lithuanian press ban#Origins and legal basis|russification]], and to [[Lithuanian press ban|ban]] the printing of books in Lithuanian.\n\n==== Ruthenia ====\n{{Main|Ruthenian nobility}}\nAfter the principalities of [[Halych]] and [[Volhynia]] became integrated with the Grand Duchy, [[Ruthenia]]'s nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural [[melting pot]] that was the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but most historians agree nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nSelf-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

[retrieved 2018.11.30.]</ref>\n\n=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===\nPolish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to their equivalents in other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

Since then their legitimacy and fate depended on the legislation and policies of the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]] in 1921.\n\nThere were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility. The szlachta was not rigidly exclusive or closed as a class, but according to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th and mid-18th century, is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of about two ennoblements per year, or 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.\n\nAccording to two English journalists [[Richard Holt Hutton]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] writing on the subject in 1864,\n\n{{quote|text=The condition of the country at the present day shows that the population consisted of two different peoples, between whom there was an impassable barrier.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

[[Jan \u0141aski]] or ''Johannes Alasco'' (1499-1560) was a cleric, whose uncle, the eponymous [[Jan \u0141aski (1456-1531)]] was [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], Archbishop of Gniezno and [[Primate of Poland]]. His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic. Approximately 45% of the population were Roman Catholic or members of Protestant denominations, 36% were Greek Catholic, 4% Orthodox, of whom some were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] or the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]es and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]].

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

This monograph describes how during the 19th century the mass of \"local\" szlachta in the western borderlands of the Russian Empire were subjected to downward mobility and rank poverty through tsarist bureaucracy and a policy of social degradation</ref> In doing so, they nevertheless retained all their constitutional and lawful prerogatives because aristocratic lineage and hereditary juridical status determined Polish nobility, not wealth nor lifestyle, as was achievable by the gentry.\n\nAn individual nobleman was called \"''szlachcic''\", while a noblewoman \"''szlachcianka''\".\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{See also|History of Poland (966\u20131385)}}\n[[File:0 Sarcophage - Soumission des sarmates - Museo Pio-Clementino (2).JPG|thumb|right|Depiction of defeated [[Sarmatians]] on a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] relief, first half of the 2nd century AD]]\n\n==== Poland ====\nThe origins of the szlachta, while ancient, have always been considered obscure.<ref name=\"davies--norman\" />{{rp|207}} As a result, its members often referred to it as ''odwieczna'' (perennial).<ref name=\"davies--norman\" />{{rp|207}} Two popular historical theories about its origins have been put forward by its members and early historians and chroniclers.

The second theory involved a presumed szlachta descent from [[Japheth]], one of [[Noah]]'s sons.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates).

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence.

In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected.

Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]].

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished.... Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\n[[Swami Vivekananda]] wanted women to set right their own problems. He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition. Daily ritual worships are performed here by the nuns. The birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and other holy personalities are celebrated here, besides the Hindu festivals. Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref>\n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.302</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months.

It consists of nuns ([[Sannyasa|Sannyasinis]] and Brahmacharinis) belonging to a monastic order for women. It was formed as per the instructions given by [[Swami Vivekananda]], a patriot-saint of India.<ref>''Swami Vivekananda's Dream, Sri Sarada Math'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2005), p.7</ref> Fifty years after the passing away of Swami Vivekananda, in 1954, the Sri Sarada Math was established at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata with a group of eight nuns.\n\nThe headquarters of Sri Sarada Math is situated on the bank of Ganga in Dakshineshwar, Kolkata. Presently, the organisation has branch centres all over India, and in Sri Lanka and Australia.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/centers.php</ref>\n\nThe main aim of the organisation is to fulfil the mission of Swami Vivekananda, that is \u2018Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva\u2019 serving God in Man, irrespective of caste, creed and nationality as well as the upliftment and empowerment of women.<ref>http://srisaradamathrb.org/our-origin/</ref><ref>''Echoes of Vedanta in the far East'' (Ramakrishna Sarada Vedanta Societty of New South Wales: Australia, 1994), p.i)</ref>\n\nThe organisation mainly propagates the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta\u2013Advaita Vedanta and four yogic ideals\u2013jnana, bhakti, karma, and Raja Yoga.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nApart from religious and spiritual teaching the organisation carries out extensive educational and philanthropic work in India. This aspect came to be a feature of many other Hindu movements. The mission bases its work on the principles of karma yoga, the principle of selfless work done with dedication to God. The Sri Sarada Math and its sister organisation, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission has centres around India, Sri Lanka, and Australia and publishes many important Vedanta and Ramakrishna-Vivekananda texts. Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, its sister organisation also shares the same headquarters at Dakshineshwar, Kolkata.\n\n== Introduction ==\nSri Sarada Math is the monastic order for women established as an independent counterpart to [[Ramakrishna Order]].\n\n2 December 1954, the Sarada Math was inaugurated by the then President of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], Revered Swami Sankarananda.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.133</ref>  \nDuring its formative days, the women who joined this order was from a family of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] devotees, such as: Brahmacharini Renu, Brahmacharini Asha, Brahmacharini Lakshmi, Brahmacharini Gauri, Brahmacharini Kalyani and others. They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992),p.48</ref> [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]],<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009),p.20</ref> [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]].\n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction [[sannyasa]] for women.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, ''Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions'' (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref> But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]].<ref>''Udbodhan'' (Phalgun issue B.S.1379)</ref> Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two institutions run by the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] for women, the [[Matri Bhavan]] (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Entally Ashrama, Women's Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]] in 1961.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the [[Sister Nivedita Girls' School]]<ref>http://www.sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory.html</ref> to the [[Ramakrishna Sarada Mission]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.138</ref>\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math's emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen.\n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.130</ref>\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973).<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref><ref>Bengali newspaper, ''Ananda Bazar Patrika'' on 31 January 1973</ref> Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]]. Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Sarala Devi lived in [[Varanasi]] from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines. She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from [[Swami Saradananda]].<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.98-101</ref> Assuming the leadership of the Sri Sarada Math, Bharatiprana served from December 1954 to January 1973, till her Mahasamadhi.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.232</ref>\nHer pious life was written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''Bharatiprana Smriti Katha'' and later translated in [[English language|English]] by Pravrajika Atmaprana as Pravrajika Bharatiprana.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.233</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Mokshaprana ===\n[[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]] (1915-1999) was the second President.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mokshaprana.php</ref> She also served as the headmistress of Sister Nivedita's Girls' School from 1946 to 1948.<ref>Mokshaprana, Pravrajika. \"Sri Sarada Society Notes Fall 1999, Volume 5, Issue 2\" (PDF). Sri Sarada Math.</ref><ref>Mokshaprana, Pravrajika. \"Guiding lights \u2013 Presidents and First General Secretary of Sri Sarada Math & Ramakrishna Sarada Mission\".</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Muktiprana ===\nPravrajika Muktiprana (1915-1994) was the third President of the Math. Her parents were disciples of [[Swami Shivananda]], a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/muktiprana.php</ref>\n\n=== Pravrajika Shraddhaprana ===\n[[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]] (1918-2009) was the fourth President and the last of the first batch of Sannyasinis.<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.20</ref>\n\n=== Current President ===\nPravrajika Bhaktiprana is the present President of Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/administration.php</ref> Mataji is assisted by two vice presidents, Pravrajika Ajayaprana and Pravrajika Anandaprana.\n\n== The Idea ==\nThe idea to form a monastic institution for women was first envisioned by [[Swami Vivekananda]], long before he established the well-known [[Ramakrishna Math]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women's Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901.\n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\n\"Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive...[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi]]s be born into the world... Hence it is her Math that I want first... Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished.... Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.181</ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\n[[Swami Vivekananda]] wanted women to set right their own problems. He has witnessed some outstanding women of renunciation among the women disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]] such as [[Gauri Ma]], [[Yogin Ma]], and [[Golap Ma]]. He wanted them to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna through an organisation.<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.112</ref>\n\nIncidently, [[Sri Sarada Devi]] too, cherished the dream to start a monastery for women. This came to light from the letters of [[Swami Saradananda]] written to [[Sara Bull]], '[[Sister Nivedita]] and myself have found out by talking to Mother that she would like to see a convent started in the fashion of the Math, Belur, for women. Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition. Daily ritual worships are performed here by the nuns. The birthdays of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and other holy personalities are celebrated here, besides the Hindu festivals. Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref>\n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.302</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006).

Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse.

Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows.

Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\"; \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\"; \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit); and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]],\" a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986).

Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded the hits \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980); \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980; \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980); and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980). \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of lesser-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded at larger US arenas and in intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3 million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With it, Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song, originally written about then girlfriend [[Elle MacPherson]], featured future wife [[Christie Brinkley]] as a high society girl, whose car pulls into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]]. Joel, his family (including young daughter Alexa), and his full touring band made the trip in August 1987.

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour.

Joel performed his classical piece titled, \"Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)\" from Fantasies and Delusions arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs \"Scandinavian Skies\" and \"Where's the Orchestra?\".\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.\n\nJoel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day. He sold out 10 concerts at the [[Mohegan Sun Casino]] in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] from May to July 2008. The casino honored him with a banner displaying his name and the number 10 to hang in the arena. On June 19, 2008, he played a concert at the grand re-opening of [[Caesars Windsor]] (formerly Casino Windsor) in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], to an invite-only crowd for Casino VIPs. His mood was light, and joke-filled, even introducing himself as \"Billy Joel's dad\" and stating \"you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy\". He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]] was the musical inspiration for \"She's Always A Woman\".<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Windsor Star]]| title= Billy Joel (notes)| date= June 20, 2008}}{{failed verification| date= October 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2008, and July 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at [[Shea Stadium]] before its demolition.

It is the only official release of Joel performing \"Christmas in Fallujah\", as Cass Dillon sang on the 2007 studio recording and the handful of times the song was played live in 2007. Joel sang the song throughout his December 2008 tour of Australia.\n\nOn May 19, 2009, Joel's former drummer, [[Liberty DeVitto]], filed a lawsuit in NYC claiming Joel and Sony Music owed DeVitto over 10 years of royalty payments.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006).

Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse. He also has three daughters: [[Alexa Ray Joel]] with Brinkley, and Della Rose and Remy Anne with Roderick.\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, New York, on May 9, 1949.

Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John.

Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\"; \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\"; \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit); and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]],\" a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986).

The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song, originally written about then girlfriend [[Elle MacPherson]], featured future wife [[Christie Brinkley]] as a high society girl, whose car pulls into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]]. Joel, his family (including young daughter Alexa), and his full touring band made the trip in August 1987.

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there.

It is set in a [[fictional universe]] inhabited by various characters capable of using supernatural powers by channeling the wavelengths of their [[soul]]s. Most of the characters in the series, including the main protagonists, are classified into two groups: humans who are born with the power to turn into weapons, called demon weapons, and the wielders of these weapons, called meisters. The main protagonists attend a school called Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) located in the fictional Death City in [[Nevada]], [[United States]]. DWMA is run by [[#Shinigami|Shinigami]], also known as [[Death (personification)|Death]], the Grim Reaper, as a training facility for weapons and meisters to hone their powers, as well as an organization to preserve world order against anyone who threatens it, including [[witchcraft|witch]]es, [[monster]]s and evil demons called ''kishin''.\n\nThe main ''Soul Eater'' manga and its anime adaptation follow three meister/weapon partnerships\u2014[[#Maka Albarn|Maka Albarn]] and her [[scythe]] [[#Soul Eater Evans|Soul Eater]]; [[#Black Star|Black Star]] and his [[Ninja#Weaponry|shadow weapon]] [[#Tsubaki Nakatsukasa|Tsubaki Nakatsukasa]]; and [[#Death the Kid|Death the Kid]] and his twin [[pistol]]s, [[#Liz and Patty Thompson|Liz and Patty Thompson]]\u2014who act as [[field agent]]s for their school and reap the souls of evil humans to prevent them from turning into ''kishin''. The [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] manga titled ''[[Soul Eater Not!]]'', also created by \u014ckubo, follows the everyday lives of three other DWMA students\u2014[[halberd]] [[#Tsugumi Harudori|Tsugumi Harudori]] and her two meister friends, [[#Meme Tatane|Meme Tatane]] and [[#Anya Hepburn|Anya Hepburn]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\nWhile creating ''Soul Eater'', [[Atsushi \u014ckubo]] was heavily influenced by the manga series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' and wanted to create a story in which serious or intense action scenes would be defused or interrupted with comedic moments. The story element in which characters transform into weapons is an expansion on the idea of weapons being personified, which \u014ckubo frequently saw in other fictional stories. \u014ckubo decided to make the main protagonist of the series, [[#Maka Albarn|Maka Albarn]], a female in response to other [[sh\u014dnen]] manga having male main characters, and paired her and the other main characters with those of the opposite sex to demonstrate an equal representation of gender. He also decided to use a [[scythe]] as Maka's weapon for its unique fighting style. He resisted drawing influence from other people for most of his characters, particularly the main protagonists, who he instead based on assets on his own personality\u2014the arrogant [[#Black Star|Black Star]] is based on \u014ckubo's narcissistic side, the neurotic [[#Death the Kid|Death the Kid]] based on his manic side, etc. However, he did base a few characters on people he was familiar with, such as [[#Excalibur|Excalibur]], whose personality he based on his own father. He also designed supporting character [[#Kilik Rung|Kilik Rung]] to be [[Black people|black]] after noting a lack of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] characters in other manga series. The names of several characters are based on the titles of other films as a form of tribute, such as [[#Blair|Blair]] being named after ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and Kilik after ''[[Kirikou and the Sorceress]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldujapon.com/2009/03/conference-publique-de-atsushi-ohkubo-createur-de.html|title=A Public Conference with the Creator of Soul Eater, Atsushi Ohkubo|publisher=Journal du Japon|accessdate=June 16, 2008|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625102405/http://www.journaldujapon.com/2009/03/conference-publique-de-atsushi-ohkubo-createur-de.html|archivedate=June 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\n[[File:SoulEaterMainCharacters.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The three main meisters of ''Soul Eater'' wielding their partners in weapon form (from left to right): Death the Kid, Maka Albarn, and Black Star.]]\n\n===''Soul Eater''===\n====Maka Albarn====\n:{{voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessup.org/jmanga/7_SOUL_20EATER/|title=Soul Eater (Manga)|accessdate=March 14, 2012|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Chiaki Omigawa]] (anime){{ref|B1|ep. 1}}|[[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Maka Albarn|\u30de\u30ab{{=}}\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3|Maka Arub\u0101n}} is one of the main protagonists of Soul Eater. She is a young but dedicated student who takes after her mother, another prodigious meister. However, her relationship with her father [[#Spirit Albarn|Spirit]] is strained due to his constant flirtations with women, leading her parents to divorce. As such, Maka is obsessed with turning her weapon partner, Soul Eater, into a death scythe that will surpass her father.{{gnr|ch|0a}} She collaborates well with Soul in battle, but sometimes gets frustrated at him when he does something foolish. When in danger, however, Maka does everything she can to keep Soul out of harm's way.{{gnr|ch|4}}\n\nThe anime depicts Maka as the most mature and casual character out of the main protagonists. She is brave, strong-willed, hard working, humble, kind, and determined to do what is right, but hates injustice and can lose control of her emotions when her friends are in danger. She also at times tends to get annoyed with Soul due to his laid back personality, but they are still good friends at heart. She differs from most main protagonists in anime in that she has the characteristics most male main protagonists have, but is a female.\n\nBecause she has strong morals and a good sense of justice, she hates seeing her father cheating on women, and tends to be annoyed with Black Star at times due to his arrogant and self-absorbed personality. There are times when she gets ticked off, she does a \"Maka Chop,\" which is when she takes a hardback book and slams it down onto that persons head. Usually her father's, Black Star, or Soul. In the anime, Maka was the only one who could defeat Asura, who was on the verge of destroying the world. Soul, Black Star, Death the Kid, their partners and Shinigami all failed to defeat him, but Maka defeated him all by herself because of her bravery. She confused Asura by proving to him she would never give up despite her being weaker and all her friends having been defeated, which made him doubt himself and confused him, allowing Maka to punch him, while he was distracted, with all her force and defeat him. In the manga, however, Maka used her courage as well as her determination to partner with Soul, Black Star, Kid, and Crona, using the weapon known as Brew to defeat the Kishin.\n\nIn the anime, Maka's kindness and compassion shows often with Crona. She recognizes him as being misunderstood and mistreated. She wants to be his friend to help him because he's been alone his whole life. She puts herself at risk of losing her sanity to help him and temporarily gives herself to the black blood in order to better understand him. Despite the others seeing him as an enemy because he's helping Medusa, she feels  he's only helping Medusa because  he had nothing else and was simply confused and misguided. She easily forgives him when discovering he was helping Medusa and spying on the academy, feeling Medusa had manipulated him into it. She loses control for the first time and violently kills Medusa with an Anti-Magic wavelength when Medusa almost kills Crona after he pushed Maka out of the way to save her.\n\nEarly in the story, Soul is infected with black blood during their first battle against [[#Crona|Crona]], which causes Maka to become infected as well, risking her going insane under the black blood's influence.{{gnr|ch|11}} She later gains some control over the black blood by developing a soul wavelength inherited from her mother called the Anti-Magic Wavelength, which helps her resist the effects of insanity.{{gnr|ch|60}} She is also adept at a skill called Soul Perception, which allows her to detect the souls of other people and measure their strengths.{{gnr|ch|2}}  After turning Soul into a death scythe, Maka gains the ability to combine the power of her uniquely shaped soul, called a [[Grigori]] soul, with Soul's and grow angelic wings on Soul's weapon form, enabling her to fly.{{gnr|ch|63}} Maka can fully synchronize with Spirit due to their bond as father and daughter.{{gnr|ch|106}} In the anime adaptation, Maka is shown to have demon weapon powers inherited from her father and mother, allowing her to conjure blades from her body while she is unconscious.{{ref|B51|ep. 51}}\n\n====Soul \"Eater\" Evans====\n:{{voiced by|[[S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[K\u014dki Uchiyama]] (anime)|[[Micah Solusod]] {{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Soul Evans|\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b9|S\u014dru Evansu}}, nicknamed {{Nihongo|Soul Eater|\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb{{=}}\u30a4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|S\u014dru \u012at\u0101}}, is a demon [[scythe]] and the partner of Maka Albarn, and the main male protagonist. His weapon form has a red-and-black blade and an eye near its heel which expresses his emotions. He has a laid-back and nonchalant personality and tries to maintain a \"cool\" attitude, but often ends up embarrassing himself instead.{{gnr|ch|0a}} He tends to bicker with Maka over unimportant things from time to time, but is fiercely loyal to her and has more than once displayed his will to die for his friends' safety.{{gnr|ch|2}} After he is slashed in the chest by [[#Crona|Ragnarok]] and infected with the Demon Sword's blood, he fights to resist the madness-inducing effects of the blood, which is portrayed by the little demon who appears within his subconscious.\n\nAs a member of a renowned family of musicians, Soul is a talented pianist, but uses his discovery of his weapon powers as an excuse to break ties from the family tradition and pursue the goal of becoming the most powerful death scythe ever. He dislikes being compared to his older brother Wes, a famous violinist, and is reluctant to play music for other people.{{gnr|ch|55}} He can use this talent when resonating his soul wavelength with others, playing the piano within his soul to drastically enhance their power.{{gnr|ch|36}} He manages to become a death scythe after defeating [[#Arachne|Arachne]] with Maka and eating her soul, gaining the ability to use sound waves and sabotage enemies with his \"Soul Hack\" attack.{{gnr|ch|62}} In the aftermath of Asura's defeat, overcoming his fear of using black blood, Soul becomes partnered to Death the Kid after he officially becomes the new Shinigami. Due to Kid's agreement with the witches to make no more death scythes, Soul becomes the last death scythe created.\n\n====Black Star====\n:{{voiced by|[[Yumiko Kobayashi]]{{ref|B1|ep. 1}}<ref name=\"dramacd\"/>|[[Brittney Karbowski]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Black Star|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u2606\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Burakku Sut\u0101|stylized as \"Black\u2606Star\"}} is a [[ninja]] assassin and the meister of Tsubaki. He is exceedingly arrogant and loudmouthed for an assassin, preferring to make a flashy entrance rather than sneaking up on his opponents, and tries to upstage anyone who gains more attention than he does.{{gnr|ch|0b}} He frequently calls himself a \"big\" man destined to surpass God, thus driving himself to his physical limits and making him one of the most athletic students at DWMA. He has made it a personal goal to defeat Kid in battle since the older boy is a  Reaper. He is a skilled combatant even when unarmed, using a skill that allows him to increase his own soul wavelength and channel it through physical attacks.{{gnr|ch|2}} He is one of the last remaining survivors of the Star Clan, a family of ninja assassins who slaughtered others for wealth until they were wiped out by DWMA, whereupon academy Professor Sid Barrett took him in and raised him. He is oppressed by anyone who recognizes the clan's symbol, a star-shaped tattoo on his shoulder.{{gnr|ch|7}} Due to his obsession with power and the fact that the Star Clan was wiped out for their consumption of souls, some believe he will eventually descend down the path towards becoming a ''kishin'' like his father, White Star.{{gnr|ch|39}} However, in his final battle with Minfune, he is asked whether he will choose the path of the \"demon\" of the \"warrior\" (his father having chosen the path of the demon). In the end, he resists such temptation, choosing to create his own new path instead.\n\n====Tsubaki Nakatsukasa====\n:{{voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Kaori Nazuka]] (anime){{ref|B1|ep. 1}}|[[Monica Rial]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Tsubaki Nakatsukasa|\u4e2d\u52d9 \u693f|Nakatsukasa Tsubaki}} is the weapon partner of Black Star, classified as a \"shadow weapon\" who has the power to transform into a variety of [[Ninja#Weaponry|ninja weapons]] including a [[kusarigama]], a [[shuriken]], a [[ninjat\u014d]], and a [[smoke bomb]].{{gnr|ch|0b}} She is gentle, quiet, friendly, and easygoing, and provides a soothing influence among her friends whenever they argue. She is also very patient and tolerant of others, which allows her to put up with Black Star's constant arrogance and showboating, and serves as a highly collaborative partner in battle.{{gnr|ch|2}} Her multiple weapon forms are part of a tradition passed down by her family, descended from the first demon weapons created by [[#Arachne|Arachne]].{{gnr|ch|28}} She later acquires her most powerful form, the Uncanny Sword (also known as the Enchanted Sword) after absorbing the soul of her corrupted brother [[#Masamune|Masamune]].{{gnr|ch|8}} She primarily takes the form of a black [[katana]] in this form, but is eventually able to transform it into other weapons as she ordinarily does.{{gnr|ch|49}}\n\n====Death the Kid====\n:{{voiced by|[[Takako Honda]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Mamoru Miyano]] (anime){{ref|B2|ep. 2}}|[[Todd Haberkorn]]{{ref|K2|ep. 2}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Death the Kid|\u30c7\u30b9\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9|Desu za Kiddo}}, called \"Kid\" for short, is the son of [[#Shinigami|Shinigami]], created from a part of his father's being like his older brother [[#Asura|Asura]] as an incomplete ''shinigami''. However, lacking his father's aspect of fear and starting out as a child, Kid grows and develops his own personality.{{gnr|ch|72}} His status as a ''shinigami'' grants him formidable godlike powers such as invincibility to a point. However, as an inheritor of Shinigami's \"madness of order\", Kid suffers from [[List of phobias|asymmetriphobia]] and a crippling [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] for [[symmetry]] in everyday life. As a result, he breaks down upon seeing anything off even by the slightest measurement, which hinders him in his daily life and in battle.{{gnr|ch|0c}} This mindset results in him becoming the meister of the Thompson sisters after seeing their matching weapon forms as a means to preserve his personal symmetry, but unable to fight using one of them while the other is missing.{{gnr|ch|13}} He can also summon a flying skateboard called [[Beelzebub]] as both transportation and a weapon. Because of his status as ''shinigami'' and a polished meister, Kid is not required to collect souls or attend DWMA, but he does so anyway to create custom weapons suited to his desires.{{gnr|ch|0c}}\n\nKid's most distinguishing feature is the set of three white lines on the left side of his hair called the Lines of [[Sanzu River|Sanzu]], which plagues him at times due to their [[asymmetry]]. However, the Lines of Sanzu are revealed to be symbol of his status as a Grim Reaper and their eventual connection would awaken his full power; control over the Madness of Order. This power can eclipse all human emotions and leave only a cycle of life and death.{{gnr|ch|110}} Later in the story, upon learning of his origins as the technical brother of Asura, Kid fears becoming a greater threat than his brother if he unlocks his full potential. But after Maka reminds him that he has a kind and trusting heart, understanding his father's true power in the process, Kid connects the Sanzu Lines and assumes his true form, thus killing his father as only one true ''shinigami'' can exist at a time.{{gnr|ch|111}}\n\n====Liz and Patty Thompson====\n:Liz: {{voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Kaida]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Akeno Watanabe]] (anime){{ref|B2|ep. 2}}|[[Jamie Marchi]]{{ref|K2|ep. 2}}}}\n:Patty: {{voiced by|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Narumi Takahira]] (anime){{ref|B2|ep. 2}}|[[Cherami Leigh]]{{ref|K2|ep. 2}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Elizabeth Thompson|\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30b9\u30fb\u30c8\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3|Erizabesu Tonpuson}} and her younger sister {{Nihongo|Patricia Thompson|\u30d1\u30c8\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30c8\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3|Patorishia Tonpuson}}\u2014nicknamed {{Nihongo|Liz|\u30ea\u30ba|Rizu}} and {{Nihongo|Patty|\u30d1\u30c6\u30a3|Pati}}, respectively\u2014are the weapon partners of Death the Kid. Liz is a cynical but mature, smart and resourceful young woman who always finds Kid's perfectionist attitude annoying, but is deathly afraid of ghosts and anything she labels as \"creepy\". Her younger sister, Patty, is known to be extremely childish, but is able to maintain a cheerful attitude in any situation that is replaced with an insane, psychotic anger when motivating her teammates or when angered. They both take the form of [[semi-automatic pistols]] that compress Kid's soul wavelength and fire it in the form of energy bullets that range in strength from destructive blasts to painful yet harmless shots.{{gnr|ch|3}} Both sisters are able to act as each other's meisters whenever Kid is absent.{{gnr|ch|0c}} As infants, they are abandoned on the streets of Brooklyn and survive by mugging passersby.

Originally a timid romantic, Tsugami seeks to improve herself since meeting Maka on her first, wanting to emulate the confident senior student.

She suffers from short-term memory loss and occasionally forgets her own name. She is also very well-endowed for her age, which Tsugumi envies her for. Despite her spacy nature, however, she is very athletic and specializes in a form of martial art called {{Nihongo|\"Sleepy Fist\"|\u7761\u62f3|Suiken}}, which she can only perform when partially unconscious.

Coming from a wealthy family, she acts condescendingly towards other people, referring to them as \"commoners\", but has become tired of her restrictive lifestyle and attends DWMA to better understand commoners. She becomes fascinated by Tsugumi, believing her to be the most average commoner of all, and desires to become her partner. She thus takes turns with Meme to wield Tsugumi; Anya becomes an expert with wielding the spear portion of Tsugumi's weapon form. Anya also tends to fight Black Star on a regular basis, their fights usually resulting with the DWMA building's symmetry being ruined.

As that fragment contains Shinigami's fear,{{gnr|ch|72}} it reflects in Asura's madness through his paranoid tendencies and quirks such as covering his face with bandages and wearing multiple layers of clothing. Eventually, to quell his constant fear, Asura swallows his own weapon {{Nihongo|Vajra|\u30f4\u30a1\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9|Vajura}} whole in order to devour human souls until he transforms into a godlike being. In that state, Asura can emit his \"madness of terror\", which deters the sanity of anyone in his presence until they are mindless beasts. Asura is eventually defeated by Shinigami, who rips off Asura's skin to use as a container to seal him in a shrine beneath the DWMA building, preventing him from escaping while have the DWMA deal with those effected by Asura's \"madness wavelength\".{{gnr|ch|16}}\n\nEarly in the story, Asura is resurrected after [[#Medusa|Medusa]]'s minions inject him with black blood and he escapes after a brief battle with Death.{{gnr|ch|22}} Though his intensified madness wavelength greatly influences the manga's plot, Asura remains largely absent until he is discovered by Maka to be hiding on the cartoonish [[moon]] in Earth's atmosphere.{{gnr|ch|90}} After his [[#Clown|Clown]] army is defeated, Asura comes out of hiding and is absorbed by Crona before taking the child's body as his own. By the time Death the Kid arrives to fight him, Asura reveals their relationship before his younger brother awakens his full power to face him as an equal. However, after the two meet and develop a plan to stop him, Maka manages to make Asura bleed while Crona uses Brew to manipulate the black blood to create a barrier around the moon to trap Asura on it.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Asura's whereabouts after his escape from Death City have him being found in a Tibetan mountain range by [[#Arachne|Arachne]], who aims to spread his madness wavelength across the world.{{ref|B39|ep. 39}} After defeating Shinigami in a second battle, revealing that he learned to stop imagining to overcome his personal fears before learning he developed feelings for the witch, Asura kills Arachne to rid himself of his weakness and eats her soul to transform into a monster.{{ref|B48|ep. 48}} Even after reverting to his original state, Asura overpowers the meisters until only Maka remains to fight on her own after Soul is knocked out.

Called a heretic among her kind, Arachne is responsible for creating the first demon weapons 800 years before the series by combining the souls of her fellow witches with humans and ordinary weapons. She goes into hiding for 800 years after being betrayed by her sister Medusa, and escapes Shinigami by scattering her body across the world in the form of countless black spiders and hiding the bulk of her soul inside a [[golem]]. She returns to power after [[#Asura|Asura]] awakens and begins spreading his madness wavelength across the world. Her plans involve capturing Asura and plunging the world into madness, eventually discarding her physical body to become a spiritual entity of pure madness to gain the power necessary to control Asura.{{gnr|ch|58}} She is killed by Maka and Soul, who collect her soul and later use it to turn the latter into a death scythe,{{gnr|ch|62}} while Medusa possesses Arachne's lifeless body to use as her own.{{gnr|ch|60}} In the anime adaptation, Arachne succeeds in capturing Asura and uses a demon tool called the Morality Manipulation Machine to amplify his madness wavelength.

This forms a symbiotic relationship between Crona and Ragnarok, the latter of whom appears from Crona's body in a black, vaguely humanoid form when not in his weapon form. Because of Medusa's abuse and Ragnarok's bullying nature, Crona is extremely reclusive and fearful of almost everything. Unlike normal weapon and meister pairs, who synchronize their soul wavelengths to increase their strength, Crona uses a skill called {{Nihongo|Scream Resonance|\u60b2\u9cf4\u5171\u9cf4|Himei Ky\u014dmei}} together with Ragnarok, who emits a scream from the mouth on his weapon form's blade that causes it to vibrate and deal additional damage.

Once fulfilling that objective, Crona is confronted by Maka and her friends before losing control with Asura taking over Crona's body.{{gnr|ch|104}} Though thought to have been completely assimilated by Asura, Crona remains intact within his subconscious before being found by Maka. By that time, having given thought to past actions while touched by her compassion, Crona thanks Maka for her friendship, jointly expresses the belief that Crona and Maka will meet again one day, and uses the Book of Eibon to access Brew in a plan to seal Asura while being trapped in the process.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, after carrying out Medusa's orders to drive [[#Franken Stein|Franken Stein]] insane, Crona tries to run away from DWMA out of guilt, but is stopped by Maka and persuaded into admitting the betrayal.{{ref|B39|ep. 39}} Crona is expelled and imprisoned within the school as punishment but, with [[#Shinigami|Shinigami]]'s blessing, is allowed to help rescue Stein from Medusa, who had formed a truce with DWMA that forbids anyone from the organization to harm her.

Witches possess the natural ability to perform magic, which commonly entices them to follow destructive instinct; however, those with regenerative magic, like Kim Diehl, are immune to this instinct. Similar to how members of DWMA develop skills to help them hunt witches, such as the ability to sense their unique soul wavelengths, witches develop skills to counterbalance DWMA, such as using an ability called Soul Protect to disguise their souls as ordinary ones at will,{{gnr|ch|5}} which also prevents them from using magic for as long as their barrier holds.{{gnr|ch|9}} Eventually, with Medusa's death, DWMA has a ceasefire with the witches to deal with the threat of Crona and Asura, and an official truce is established between the two groups after Death the Kid replaces his father as the new ''shinigami''.\n\n====Eruka Frog====\n:{{voiced by|[[Misato Fukuen]]|Kate Oxley}}{{ref|B12|ep. 12}}{{ref|K12|ep. 12}}\n{{Nihongo|Eruka Frog|\u30a8\u30eb\u30ab{{=}}\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30b0|Eruka Furoggu}} is a [[frog]]-themed witch who is enslaved by Medusa after a failed attempt at killing her, resulting in Medusa infesting her body with countless magical snakes that would rip her to shreds.{{gnr|ch|9}}  Eruka is consequently forced to carry out various tasks for Medusa with the promise that one of these snakes be removed for every task she completes.{{gnr|ch|10}} Keeping with her frog-like nature, she makes croaking sounds whenever she speaks. She despises Medusa, believing that her plans threaten the existence of all witches. Cowardly in nature, she has the power to transform herself into a frog to escape from danger and spy on others.

Having forgotten his real name while in prison, he calls himself \"Free\" to celebrate his freedom.{{gnr|ch|10}} He is generally carefree and clumsy, which occasionally causes him to injure himself in battle.{{gnr|ch|11}} As a werewolf, he has the power to transform into his lupine form at will, granting him enhanced strength and speed. He also has a rapid healing factor which, combined with his immortality, makes him virtually invincible. The magic eye he stole from Maba gives him access to additional magic powers such as conjuring ice to form weapons, and manipulating [[space]] to trap others inside another dimension and create magical projections of himself.{{gnr|ch|15|,|20}} Eventually, getting himself captured in a failed attempt to save Eruka, Free is drafted to aid the DWMA in setting up the ceasefire with the witches.\n\n===Clown===\n:{{voiced by|[[Hirofumi Nojima]]|[[Jerry Jewell]]}}{{ref|B43|ep. 43}}{{ref|K43|ep. 43}}\nA {{Nihongo|\"clown\"|\u9053\u5316\u5e2b|d\u014dkeshi}} is the name given to any physical embodiment of madness in ''Soul Eater'' that takes the form of a vaguely humanoid clown.

The book contains blueprints for Eibon's demon tools, as well as a [[pocket universe]] modeled after the book's seven chapters, each based on one of the [[seven deadly sins]]. There is also an eighth hidden chapter, where a shadowy being that was one of the Great Old Ones resides due to his corruptive madness wavelength. Also residing within this world is a mechanical being created by Eibon called the {{Nihongo|Table of Contents|\u76ee\u6b21|Mokuji}}, which represents the book's intelligence and aims to spread his creator's knowledge, and the madness that would be caused by it, across the world, making him the third major antagonist in the series.{{gnr|ch|82}}\n\n====Noah====\n{{Nihongo|Noah|\u30ce\u30a2|Noa}} is the collective name of a group of artificial beings created by the Table of Contents to assist in the dispersal of Eibon's knowledge.

Noah is served by a young man named {{Nihongo|Gopher|\u30b4\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb|Goferu}}, who worships Noah fanatically and envies anyone who has his master's attention.

Ultimately, Noah's reason for aiding Asura is only to add him to his collection once the ''kishin'' regains his strength.

However, Kid's friends venture into the Book of Eibon to save him and destroy Noah in the process.{{gnr|ch|81}} An aggressive Noah representing [[Seven deadly sins#Wrath|wrath]] is created soon after and attempts to capture Asura with Gopher's aid as they venture to the moon.{{gnr|ch|82}} However, as Asura is absorbed by the child, Noah is defeated by Crona who ejects him and his other \"brothers\" from the absorbed Book of Eibon.\n\n==DWMA==\n{{Nihongo|Death Weapon Meister Academy|\u6b7b\u795e\u6b66\u5668\u8077\u4eba\u5c02\u9580\u5b66\u6821|Shinigami Buki Shokunin Senmon Gakk\u014d}}\u2014called {{Nihongo|DWMA|\u6b7b\u6b66\u5c02|Shibusen}} for short\u2014is an international organization founded and headed by Shinigami, the [[death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], to preserve world order and prevent the birth of another ''kishin'' after [[#Asura|Asura]].

In the manga, he is a member of DWMA's [[internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] division from [[Oceania]] who specializes in [[lie detection]] through his highly developed Soul Perception ability, which allows him to read the souls of witches even while they disguise themselves with Soul Protect.{{gnr|ch|38}} He has a past romance with [[#Marie Mjolnir|Marie Mjolnir]], who he breaks up with prior to the start of the story out of concern that his Soul Perception would disrupt their relationship.

The main protagonists of ''Soul Eater'' attend the school's EAT class, while the spin-off manga ''Soul Eater Not!'' focuses on students from the NOT class. Later in the main story, a unit of elite meister and weapon students called {{Nihongo|Spartoi|\u30b9\u30d1\u30eb\u30c8\u30a4|Suparutoi}}\u2014also called the {{Nihongo|DWMA Junior Elite Corps|\u6b7b\u6b66\u5c02\u82e5\u624b\u7cbe\u92ed\u90e8\u968a|Shibusen Wakate Seiei Butai}}\u2014is formed by the main protagonists in addition to students Ox Ford, Kilik Rung, and Kim Diehl and their weapon partners.{{gnr|ch|62}}\n\n====Ox Ford and Harvar====\n:Ox: {{voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|[[Josh Grelle]]}}{{ref|B14|ep. 14}}{{ref|K14|ep. 14}}\n:Harvar: {{voiced by|[[Wataru Hatano]]|[[Scott Freeman (voice actor)|Scott Freeman]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Ox Ford|\u30aa\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9|Okkusu F\u014ddo}} is a meister and [[honors student]] who attends DWMA's EAT class.

Ox has a shaved head with two spikes of hair on the sides of his head, which he takes great pride in. He has a mostly one-sided love for Kim Diehl, and is instrumental in persuading her to return to DWMA after she defects and is brainwashed into serving Arachnophobia, going as far as ripping out his hair to prove his loyalty to her, and growing out a full head of hair at her request.\n\n====Kilik Rung====\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenichi Suzumura]]|[[Joel McDonald (actor)|Joel McDonald]]}}{{ref|B18|ep. 18}}{{ref|K18|ep. 18}}\n{{Nihongo|Kilik Rung|\u30ad\u30ea\u30af\u30fb\u30eb\u30f3\u30b0|Kiriku Rungu}} is an EAT class meister whose weapon partners, the young children {{Nihongo|Pot of Fire|\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2|Potto obu Faia}} and {{Nihongo|Pot of Thunder|\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc|Potto obu Sand\u0101}}, take the form of a pair of large [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. Fire and Thunder are twin brother and sister, respectively, who never speak but have the ability to communicate with nature and sense danger. As per his weapons' namesakes, Kilik is able to produce fire and electricity from the Pots while wielding them, allowing him to collaborate well with Ox Ford and Kim Diehl, who he is close friends with.

Kim has a tendency to bully fellow students by charging them money while performing tasks for them. She is the object of fellow student Ox Ford's affections, though she is often annoyed by his romantic advances. She is later revealed to be a tanuki witch who possesses regenerative powers, allowing her to heal both herself and others when injured, going against the typically destructive nature of other witches. In ''Soul Eater Not!'', Kim is shown to befriend Jacqueline, one of her bully victims (who has a secret crush on Kim), after the latter discovers her witch identity and helps keep it a secret. In the main series manga, Kim's identity is exposed by [[#Medusa|Medusa]], causing her and Jacqueline flee DWMA together and reluctantly join Arachnophobia for protection.

From its prison, the being resolves to use its madness wavelength to test those worthy to take over when the Great Old Ones are all gone. The being puts [[#Black Star|Black Star]] and [[#Death the Kid|Death the Kid]] through its test by having them battle each other, deeming their generation ideal successors when they reach a mutual conclusion of what kind of world to create without causing misery through power.{{gnr|ch|80}}\n\n===Blair===\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuko Sasamoto]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (anime){{ref|B1|ep. 1}}|[[Leah Clark]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Blair|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a2|Burea}} is a [[black cat]] with exceptionally strong magic powers, including the power to transform into a young, alluring human woman among other spells, such as conjuring pumpkin-shaped explosions and summoning a giant flying pumpkin for transportation.

It is set in a [[fictional universe]] inhabited by various characters capable of using supernatural powers by channeling the wavelengths of their [[soul]]s. Most of the characters in the series, including the main protagonists, are classified into two groups: humans who are born with the power to turn into weapons, called demon weapons, and the wielders of these weapons, called meisters. The main protagonists attend a school called Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA) located in the fictional Death City in [[Nevada]], [[United States]]. DWMA is run by [[#Shinigami|Shinigami]], also known as [[Death (personification)|Death]], the Grim Reaper, as a training facility for weapons and meisters to hone their powers, as well as an organization to preserve world order against anyone who threatens it, including [[witchcraft|witch]]es, [[monster]]s and evil demons called ''kishin''.\n\nThe main ''Soul Eater'' manga and its anime adaptation follow three meister/weapon partnerships\u2014[[#Maka Albarn|Maka Albarn]] and her [[scythe]] [[#Soul Eater Evans|Soul Eater]]; [[#Black Star|Black Star]] and his [[Ninja#Weaponry|shadow weapon]] [[#Tsubaki Nakatsukasa|Tsubaki Nakatsukasa]]; and [[#Death the Kid|Death the Kid]] and his twin [[pistol]]s, [[#Liz and Patty Thompson|Liz and Patty Thompson]]\u2014who act as [[field agent]]s for their school and reap the souls of evil humans to prevent them from turning into ''kishin''. The [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] manga titled ''[[Soul Eater Not!]]'', also created by \u014ckubo, follows the everyday lives of three other DWMA students\u2014[[halberd]] [[#Tsugumi Harudori|Tsugumi Harudori]] and her two meister friends, [[#Meme Tatane|Meme Tatane]] and [[#Anya Hepburn|Anya Hepburn]].\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\nWhile creating ''Soul Eater'', [[Atsushi \u014ckubo]] was heavily influenced by the manga series ''[[Dr. Slump]]'' and wanted to create a story in which serious or intense action scenes would be defused or interrupted with comedic moments. The story element in which characters transform into weapons is an expansion on the idea of weapons being personified, which \u014ckubo frequently saw in other fictional stories. \u014ckubo decided to make the main protagonist of the series, [[#Maka Albarn|Maka Albarn]], a female in response to other [[sh\u014dnen]] manga having male main characters, and paired her and the other main characters with those of the opposite sex to demonstrate an equal representation of gender. He also decided to use a [[scythe]] as Maka's weapon for its unique fighting style. He resisted drawing influence from other people for most of his characters, particularly the main protagonists, who he instead based on assets on his own personality\u2014the arrogant [[#Black Star|Black Star]] is based on \u014ckubo's narcissistic side, the neurotic [[#Death the Kid|Death the Kid]] based on his manic side, etc. However, he did base a few characters on people he was familiar with, such as [[#Excalibur|Excalibur]], whose personality he based on his own father. He also designed supporting character [[#Kilik Rung|Kilik Rung]] to be [[Black people|black]] after noting a lack of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] characters in other manga series. The names of several characters are based on the titles of other films as a form of tribute, such as [[#Blair|Blair]] being named after ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and Kilik after ''[[Kirikou and the Sorceress]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldujapon.com/2009/03/conference-publique-de-atsushi-ohkubo-createur-de.html|title=A Public Conference with the Creator of Soul Eater, Atsushi Ohkubo|publisher=Journal du Japon|accessdate=June 16, 2008|language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625102405/http://www.journaldujapon.com/2009/03/conference-publique-de-atsushi-ohkubo-createur-de.html|archivedate=June 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\n[[File:SoulEaterMainCharacters.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The three main meisters of ''Soul Eater'' wielding their partners in weapon form (from left to right): Death the Kid, Maka Albarn, and Black Star.]]\n\n===''Soul Eater''===\n====Maka Albarn====\n:{{voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessup.org/jmanga/7_SOUL_20EATER/|title=Soul Eater (Manga)|accessdate=March 14, 2012|language=Japanese}}</ref> [[Chiaki Omigawa]] (anime){{ref|B1|ep. 1}}|[[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Maka Albarn|\u30de\u30ab{{=}}\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3|Maka Arub\u0101n}} is one of the main protagonists of Soul Eater. She is a young but dedicated student who takes after her mother, another prodigious meister. However, her relationship with her father [[#Spirit Albarn|Spirit]] is strained due to his constant flirtations with women, leading her parents to divorce. As such, Maka is obsessed with turning her weapon partner, Soul Eater, into a death scythe that will surpass her father.{{gnr|ch|0a}} She collaborates well with Soul in battle, but sometimes gets frustrated at him when he does something foolish. When in danger, however, Maka does everything she can to keep Soul out of harm's way.{{gnr|ch|4}}\n\nThe anime depicts Maka as the most mature and casual character out of the main protagonists. She is brave, strong-willed, hard working, humble, kind, and determined to do what is right, but hates injustice and can lose control of her emotions when her friends are in danger. She also at times tends to get annoyed with Soul due to his laid back personality, but they are still good friends at heart. She differs from most main protagonists in anime in that she has the characteristics most male main protagonists have, but is a female.\n\nBecause she has strong morals and a good sense of justice, she hates seeing her father cheating on women, and tends to be annoyed with Black Star at times due to his arrogant and self-absorbed personality. There are times when she gets ticked off, she does a \"Maka Chop,\" which is when she takes a hardback book and slams it down onto that persons head. Usually her father's, Black Star, or Soul. In the anime, Maka was the only one who could defeat Asura, who was on the verge of destroying the world. Soul, Black Star, Death the Kid, their partners and Shinigami all failed to defeat him, but Maka defeated him all by herself because of her bravery. She confused Asura by proving to him she would never give up despite her being weaker and all her friends having been defeated, which made him doubt himself and confused him, allowing Maka to punch him, while he was distracted, with all her force and defeat him. In the manga, however, Maka used her courage as well as her determination to partner with Soul, Black Star, Kid, and Crona, using the weapon known as Brew to defeat the Kishin.\n\nIn the anime, Maka's kindness and compassion shows often with Crona. She recognizes him as being misunderstood and mistreated. She wants to be his friend to help him because he's been alone his whole life. She puts herself at risk of losing her sanity to help him and temporarily gives herself to the black blood in order to better understand him. Despite the others seeing him as an enemy because he's helping Medusa, she feels  he's only helping Medusa because  he had nothing else and was simply confused and misguided. She easily forgives him when discovering he was helping Medusa and spying on the academy, feeling Medusa had manipulated him into it. She loses control for the first time and violently kills Medusa with an Anti-Magic wavelength when Medusa almost kills Crona after he pushed Maka out of the way to save her.\n\nEarly in the story, Soul is infected with black blood during their first battle against [[#Crona|Crona]], which causes Maka to become infected as well, risking her going insane under the black blood's influence.{{gnr|ch|11}} She later gains some control over the black blood by developing a soul wavelength inherited from her mother called the Anti-Magic Wavelength, which helps her resist the effects of insanity.{{gnr|ch|60}} She is also adept at a skill called Soul Perception, which allows her to detect the souls of other people and measure their strengths.{{gnr|ch|2}}  After turning Soul into a death scythe, Maka gains the ability to combine the power of her uniquely shaped soul, called a [[Grigori]] soul, with Soul's and grow angelic wings on Soul's weapon form, enabling her to fly.{{gnr|ch|63}} Maka can fully synchronize with Spirit due to their bond as father and daughter.{{gnr|ch|106}} In the anime adaptation, Maka is shown to have demon weapon powers inherited from her father and mother, allowing her to conjure blades from her body while she is unconscious.{{ref|B51|ep. 51}}\n\n====Soul \"Eater\" Evans====\n:{{voiced by|[[S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[K\u014dki Uchiyama]] (anime)|[[Micah Solusod]] {{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Soul Evans|\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b9|S\u014dru Evansu}}, nicknamed {{Nihongo|Soul Eater|\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb{{=}}\u30a4\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc|S\u014dru \u012at\u0101}}, is a demon [[scythe]] and the partner of Maka Albarn, and the main male protagonist.

He dislikes being compared to his older brother Wes, a famous violinist, and is reluctant to play music for other people.{{gnr|ch|55}} He can use this talent when resonating his soul wavelength with others, playing the piano within his soul to drastically enhance their power.{{gnr|ch|36}} He manages to become a death scythe after defeating [[#Arachne|Arachne]] with Maka and eating her soul, gaining the ability to use sound waves and sabotage enemies with his \"Soul Hack\" attack.{{gnr|ch|62}} In the aftermath of Asura's defeat, overcoming his fear of using black blood, Soul becomes partnered to Death the Kid after he officially becomes the new Shinigami.

He is exceedingly arrogant and loudmouthed for an assassin, preferring to make a flashy entrance rather than sneaking up on his opponents, and tries to upstage anyone who gains more attention than he does.{{gnr|ch|0b}} He frequently calls himself a \"big\" man destined to surpass God, thus driving himself to his physical limits and making him one of the most athletic students at DWMA. He has made it a personal goal to defeat Kid in battle since the older boy is a  Reaper. He is a skilled combatant even when unarmed, using a skill that allows him to increase his own soul wavelength and channel it through physical attacks.{{gnr|ch|2}} He is one of the last remaining survivors of the Star Clan, a family of ninja assassins who slaughtered others for wealth until they were wiped out by DWMA, whereupon academy Professor Sid Barrett took him in and raised him. He is oppressed by anyone who recognizes the clan's symbol, a star-shaped tattoo on his shoulder.{{gnr|ch|7}} Due to his obsession with power and the fact that the Star Clan was wiped out for their consumption of souls, some believe he will eventually descend down the path towards becoming a ''kishin'' like his father, White Star.{{gnr|ch|39}} However, in his final battle with Minfune, he is asked whether he will choose the path of the \"demon\" of the \"warrior\" (his father having chosen the path of the demon). In the end, he resists such temptation, choosing to create his own new path instead.\n\n====Tsubaki Nakatsukasa====\n:{{voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Kaori Nazuka]] (anime){{ref|B1|ep. 1}}|[[Monica Rial]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Tsubaki Nakatsukasa|\u4e2d\u52d9 \u693f|Nakatsukasa Tsubaki}} is the weapon partner of Black Star, classified as a \"shadow weapon\" who has the power to transform into a variety of [[Ninja#Weaponry|ninja weapons]] including a [[kusarigama]], a [[shuriken]], a [[ninjat\u014d]], and a [[smoke bomb]].{{gnr|ch|0b}} She is gentle, quiet, friendly, and easygoing, and provides a soothing influence among her friends whenever they argue. She is also very patient and tolerant of others, which allows her to put up with Black Star's constant arrogance and showboating, and serves as a highly collaborative partner in battle.{{gnr|ch|2}} Her multiple weapon forms are part of a tradition passed down by her family, descended from the first demon weapons created by [[#Arachne|Arachne]].{{gnr|ch|28}} She later acquires her most powerful form, the Uncanny Sword (also known as the Enchanted Sword) after absorbing the soul of her corrupted brother [[#Masamune|Masamune]].{{gnr|ch|8}} She primarily takes the form of a black [[katana]] in this form, but is eventually able to transform it into other weapons as she ordinarily does.{{gnr|ch|49}}\n\n====Death the Kid====\n:{{voiced by|[[Takako Honda]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Mamoru Miyano]] (anime){{ref|B2|ep. 2}}|[[Todd Haberkorn]]{{ref|K2|ep. 2}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Death the Kid|\u30c7\u30b9\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30ad\u30c3\u30c9|Desu za Kiddo}}, called \"Kid\" for short, is the son of [[#Shinigami|Shinigami]], created from a part of his father's being like his older brother [[#Asura|Asura]] as an incomplete ''shinigami''. However, lacking his father's aspect of fear and starting out as a child, Kid grows and develops his own personality.{{gnr|ch|72}} His status as a ''shinigami'' grants him formidable godlike powers such as invincibility to a point. However, as an inheritor of Shinigami's \"madness of order\", Kid suffers from [[List of phobias|asymmetriphobia]] and a crippling [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] for [[symmetry]] in everyday life. As a result, he breaks down upon seeing anything off even by the slightest measurement, which hinders him in his daily life and in battle.{{gnr|ch|0c}} This mindset results in him becoming the meister of the Thompson sisters after seeing their matching weapon forms as a means to preserve his personal symmetry, but unable to fight using one of them while the other is missing.{{gnr|ch|13}} He can also summon a flying skateboard called [[Beelzebub]] as both transportation and a weapon. Because of his status as ''shinigami'' and a polished meister, Kid is not required to collect souls or attend DWMA, but he does so anyway to create custom weapons suited to his desires.{{gnr|ch|0c}}\n\nKid's most distinguishing feature is the set of three white lines on the left side of his hair called the Lines of [[Sanzu River|Sanzu]], which plagues him at times due to their [[asymmetry]]. However, the Lines of Sanzu are revealed to be symbol of his status as a Grim Reaper and their eventual connection would awaken his full power; control over the Madness of Order. This power can eclipse all human emotions and leave only a cycle of life and death.{{gnr|ch|110}} Later in the story, upon learning of his origins as the technical brother of Asura, Kid fears becoming a greater threat than his brother if he unlocks his full potential. But after Maka reminds him that he has a kind and trusting heart, understanding his father's true power in the process, Kid connects the Sanzu Lines and assumes his true form, thus killing his father as only one true ''shinigami'' can exist at a time.{{gnr|ch|111}}\n\n====Liz and Patty Thompson====\n:Liz: {{voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Kaida]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Akeno Watanabe]] (anime){{ref|B2|ep. 2}}|[[Jamie Marchi]]{{ref|K2|ep. 2}}}}\n:Patty: {{voiced by|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Narumi Takahira]] (anime){{ref|B2|ep. 2}}|[[Cherami Leigh]]{{ref|K2|ep. 2}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Elizabeth Thompson|\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30b9\u30fb\u30c8\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3|Erizabesu Tonpuson}} and her younger sister {{Nihongo|Patricia Thompson|\u30d1\u30c8\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30c8\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3|Patorishia Tonpuson}}\u2014nicknamed {{Nihongo|Liz|\u30ea\u30ba|Rizu}} and {{Nihongo|Patty|\u30d1\u30c6\u30a3|Pati}}, respectively\u2014are the weapon partners of Death the Kid.

Her younger sister, Patty, is known to be extremely childish, but is able to maintain a cheerful attitude in any situation that is replaced with an insane, psychotic anger when motivating her teammates or when angered. They both take the form of [[semi-automatic pistols]] that compress Kid's soul wavelength and fire it in the form of energy bullets that range in strength from destructive blasts to painful yet harmless shots.{{gnr|ch|3}} Both sisters are able to act as each other's meisters whenever Kid is absent.{{gnr|ch|0c}} As infants, they are abandoned on the streets of Brooklyn and survive by mugging passersby.

Originally a timid romantic, Tsugami seeks to improve herself since meeting Maka on her first, wanting to emulate the confident senior student. She becomes friends with two Meisters Meme Tatane and Anya Hepburn, alternating between them as a weapon, but will eventually pick one of them to be her official meister partner.

Coming from a wealthy family, she acts condescendingly towards other people, referring to them as \"commoners\", but has become tired of her restrictive lifestyle and attends DWMA to better understand commoners. She becomes fascinated by Tsugumi, believing her to be the most average commoner of all, and desires to become her partner. She thus takes turns with Meme to wield Tsugumi; Anya becomes an expert with wielding the spear portion of Tsugumi's weapon form. Anya also tends to fight Black Star on a regular basis, their fights usually resulting with the DWMA building's symmetry being ruined.

Eventually, to quell his constant fear, Asura swallows his own weapon {{Nihongo|Vajra|\u30f4\u30a1\u30b8\u30e5\u30e9|Vajura}} whole in order to devour human souls until he transforms into a godlike being. In that state, Asura can emit his \"madness of terror\", which deters the sanity of anyone in his presence until they are mindless beasts.

Similar to how members of DWMA develop skills to help them hunt witches, such as the ability to sense their unique soul wavelengths, witches develop skills to counterbalance DWMA, such as using an ability called Soul Protect to disguise their souls as ordinary ones at will,{{gnr|ch|5}} which also prevents them from using magic for as long as their barrier holds.{{gnr|ch|9}} Eventually, with Medusa's death, DWMA has a ceasefire with the witches to deal with the threat of Crona and Asura, and an official truce is established between the two groups after Death the Kid replaces his father as the new ''shinigami''.\n\n====Eruka Frog====\n:{{voiced by|[[Misato Fukuen]]|Kate Oxley}}{{ref|B12|ep. 12}}{{ref|K12|ep. 12}}\n{{Nihongo|Eruka Frog|\u30a8\u30eb\u30ab{{=}}\u30d5\u30ed\u30c3\u30b0|Eruka Furoggu}} is a [[frog]]-themed witch who is enslaved by Medusa after a failed attempt at killing her, resulting in Medusa infesting her body with countless magical snakes that would rip her to shreds.{{gnr|ch|9}}  Eruka is consequently forced to carry out various tasks for Medusa with the promise that one of these snakes be removed for every task she completes.{{gnr|ch|10}} Keeping with her frog-like nature, she makes croaking sounds whenever she speaks.

The book contains blueprints for Eibon's demon tools, as well as a [[pocket universe]] modeled after the book's seven chapters, each based on one of the [[seven deadly sins]]. There is also an eighth hidden chapter, where a shadowy being that was one of the Great Old Ones resides due to his corruptive madness wavelength. Also residing within this world is a mechanical being created by Eibon called the {{Nihongo|Table of Contents|\u76ee\u6b21|Mokuji}}, which represents the book's intelligence and aims to spread his creator's knowledge, and the madness that would be caused by it, across the world, making him the third major antagonist in the series.{{gnr|ch|82}}\n\n====Noah====\n{{Nihongo|Noah|\u30ce\u30a2|Noa}} is the collective name of a group of artificial beings created by the Table of Contents to assist in the dispersal of Eibon's knowledge.

Ultimately, Noah's reason for aiding Asura is only to add him to his collection once the ''kishin'' regains his strength.

He always wears a hat or headband to cover the hole left in his head when he was killed. He is shown not to like his current appearance as shown when Crona was frightened of him. This made him go through melancholy and made him wish he never came back to life. He is a surrogate father to [[#Black Star|Black Star]], who he had spared and taken in as an infant during DWMA's extermination of the Star Clan.{{gnr|ch|57}} He employs [[ninja]]-like skills in battle, using his powers as a zombie to instantaneously burrow underground and surprise his opponent.

In the manga, he is a member of DWMA's [[internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] division from [[Oceania]] who specializes in [[lie detection]] through his highly developed Soul Perception ability, which allows him to read the souls of witches even while they disguise themselves with Soul Protect.{{gnr|ch|38}} He has a past romance with [[#Marie Mjolnir|Marie Mjolnir]], who he breaks up with prior to the start of the story out of concern that his Soul Perception would disrupt their relationship.

The main protagonists of ''Soul Eater'' attend the school's EAT class, while the spin-off manga ''Soul Eater Not!'' focuses on students from the NOT class. Later in the main story, a unit of elite meister and weapon students called {{Nihongo|Spartoi|\u30b9\u30d1\u30eb\u30c8\u30a4|Suparutoi}}\u2014also called the {{Nihongo|DWMA Junior Elite Corps|\u6b7b\u6b66\u5c02\u82e5\u624b\u7cbe\u92ed\u90e8\u968a|Shibusen Wakate Seiei Butai}}\u2014is formed by the main protagonists in addition to students Ox Ford, Kilik Rung, and Kim Diehl and their weapon partners.{{gnr|ch|62}}\n\n====Ox Ford and Harvar====\n:Ox: {{voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|[[Josh Grelle]]}}{{ref|B14|ep. 14}}{{ref|K14|ep. 14}}\n:Harvar: {{voiced by|[[Wataru Hatano]]|[[Scott Freeman (voice actor)|Scott Freeman]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Ox Ford|\u30aa\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c9|Okkusu F\u014ddo}} is a meister and [[honors student]] who attends DWMA's EAT class.

Ox has a shaved head with two spikes of hair on the sides of his head, which he takes great pride in. He has a mostly one-sided love for Kim Diehl, and is instrumental in persuading her to return to DWMA after she defects and is brainwashed into serving Arachnophobia, going as far as ripping out his hair to prove his loyalty to her, and growing out a full head of hair at her request.\n\n====Kilik Rung====\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenichi Suzumura]]|[[Joel McDonald (actor)|Joel McDonald]]}}{{ref|B18|ep. 18}}{{ref|K18|ep. 18}}\n{{Nihongo|Kilik Rung|\u30ad\u30ea\u30af\u30fb\u30eb\u30f3\u30b0|Kiriku Rungu}} is an EAT class meister whose weapon partners, the young children {{Nihongo|Pot of Fire|\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2|Potto obu Faia}} and {{Nihongo|Pot of Thunder|\u30dd\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc|Potto obu Sand\u0101}}, take the form of a pair of large [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. Fire and Thunder are twin brother and sister, respectively, who never speak but have the ability to communicate with nature and sense danger. As per his weapons' namesakes, Kilik is able to produce fire and electricity from the Pots while wielding them, allowing him to collaborate well with Ox Ford and Kim Diehl, who he is close friends with. In the anime, he is good friends with Black Star, who often gets Kilik to partner with him during his fights, and is mentioned to be one of the top three fighters at the school in terms of raw power by Hero.\n\n====Kim Diehl and Jacqueline O'Lantern Dupr\u00e9====\n:Kim: {{voiced by|[[Chiwa Sait\u014d]]|[[Caitlin Glass]]}}{{ref|B32|ep. 32}}{{ref|K25|ep. 32}}\n:Jacqueline: {{voiced by|[[Kanae Oki]]|[[Jad Saxton]]}}\n{{Nihongo|Kim Diehl|\u30ad\u30e0\u30fb\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb|Kimu D\u012bru}} is an EAT class meister and partner of {{Nihongo|Jacqueline O'Lantern Dupr\u00e9|\u30b8\u30e3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30fb\u30c7\u30e5\u30d7\u30ec|Jakur\u012bn \u014c Rantan Dyupure}}, nicknamed {{Nihongo|Jackie|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc|Jakk\u012b}}, who takes the form of a square hand lantern that Kim wields like a flamethrower in battle, and can extend her handle to serve as an airborne mode of transportation. Kim has a tendency to bully fellow students by charging them money while performing tasks for them. She is the object of fellow student Ox Ford's affections, though she is often annoyed by his romantic advances. She is later revealed to be a tanuki witch who possesses regenerative powers, allowing her to heal both herself and others when injured, going against the typically destructive nature of other witches. In ''Soul Eater Not!'', Kim is shown to befriend Jacqueline, one of her bully victims (who has a secret crush on Kim), after the latter discovers her witch identity and helps keep it a secret. In the main series manga, Kim's identity is exposed by [[#Medusa|Medusa]], causing her and Jacqueline flee DWMA together and reluctantly join Arachnophobia for protection.

From its prison, the being resolves to use its madness wavelength to test those worthy to take over when the Great Old Ones are all gone. The being puts [[#Black Star|Black Star]] and [[#Death the Kid|Death the Kid]] through its test by having them battle each other, deeming their generation ideal successors when they reach a mutual conclusion of what kind of world to create without causing misery through power.{{gnr|ch|80}}\n\n===Blair===\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuko Sasamoto]] (drama CD),<ref name=\"dramacd\"/> [[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (anime){{ref|B1|ep. 1}}|[[Leah Clark]]{{ref|K1|ep. 1}}}}\n{{Nihongo|Blair|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a2|Burea}} is a [[black cat]] with exceptionally strong magic powers, including the power to transform into a young, alluring human woman among other spells, such as conjuring pumpkin-shaped explosions and summoning a giant flying pumpkin for transportation.
