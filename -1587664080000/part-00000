For 1968, three cars were actually constructed: two for racing and one for shows and demonstrations. In 1969, Jeffords left the team and Kaplan was contracted to run the program. Using his developmental work from the prior year, Kaplan built three more cars, two for AMC and one for himself using his own finances.\n\nFor 1968, the initial drivers had been George Follmer (#1) and Peter Revson (#2). Revson was let go part way through the year after a disagreement with management. The team picked up Lothar Motschenbacher for the next two races in Canada.\n\nThe first year of the AMC program was a success; the team was written up as a \"Cinderella\" team. American Motors placed third in the over-2-liter class of the 1968 series,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.trans-amseries.com/results/1968.pdf |title=1968 TRANS-AM Box Scores |publisher=SSCA news |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}</ref> and established a record as the only factory entry to finish every Trans-Am race entered.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.amx-perience.com/Trans_Am_Racing_1968.php |title=Trans-Am Racing 1968 |publisher=AMX-perience |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141004223243/http://amx-perience.com/Trans_Am_Racing_1968.php |archivedate=4 October 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2014}}\nFor 1968, the team had consistently improved and suffered only one DNF (did not finish) from an engine problem. The race program was supporting a company that had no performance parts, no test facility, and no technical support for the program. As for the production cars, they had no anti-dive potential built into the uni-body; only single-barrel carburetor manifolds; and even when running properly, they did not make as much horsepower as the competitors. The 1968 deal provided Jeffords and Kaplan support from Carl Chakmakian, who was the primary contact on the AMC program.\n\nThe performance of the team in 1968 can be attributed to the efforts of Kaplan, his staff, and help from other west coast manufacturers. Kaplan set out to resolve handling problems and fix engine oiling problems. Mid-season, he also started the development of a dual-carburetor cross-ram manifold and (looking ahead) a new engine casting.\n\nThe development of the [[Watt's linkage]] rear suspension came first. This was followed by the front anti-dive modifications. The development of the anti-dive geometry was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC's schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang's 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the unibody on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building performance parts for Ford.\n\nThe building of reliable and powerful engines took a bit more time. The team started the 1968 season with two engines from TRACO. Although TRACO had worked hard to resolve oiling issues and to generate as much power as they could, single-carb layout and the basic two-bolt-main block were serious limitations.\n\nTo develop a cross-ram manifold, Kaplan went to Vic Edelbrock, who not only loaned him a pattern maker but also gave him a lot of personal help. Kaplan was also helped by [[Champion (spark plug)|Champion Spark Plugs]] who let him use their dyno room to fine-tune and correct any design problems.\n\nTowards the end of 1968, Kaplan enlisted help from Dan Byer, a retired engineer from AMC, for the development of a new block casting. Using the basic AMC 390 drawings, they added more mass for four-bolt mains and improved the oiling system. A run of 50 blocks was contracted to Central Foundries in Windsor, Ontario. Because this was a small run, and there was little factory support, it fell to Kaplan and his staff to clean up the blocks from the sand casting, hone the various passages and, finally, send them to AMC's \"Parts Central\" in Kenosha. From there, they could draw on the inventory, as required.\n\nIf one were to put a small number of specially cast blocks into the general inventory, chances are pretty good that they would be difficult to find them again, so Kaplan painted all the blocks in a bright orange so they could identify them on the transfer line. Kaplan drew on about 12 of these special castings during his development program and two were eventually (much later) sold to customers.\n\nKaplan's specific preparations included shaving the deck on the new block by about 5/8 inch and heavily modifying the ports. The new cross-ram manifold was installed and Kaplan would add his own specifically designed pistons, a shorter throw crankshaft and new camshaft. While a few engines were lost during testing, the whole design proved quite reliable.\n\nIn the intervening period, AMC replaced Kaplan's race program contact with two new men (Chris Schoenlip and John Voelbel from Lever Brothers (soap marketing people)), who had no experience in the automotive field and were ignorant of anything to do with racing. They would ultimately prove to be more trouble than they were worth. In fact, it was these two new boys who failed to enter the parts into the official AMC parts system and to submit homologation papers. The importance of this mistake became clear when Kaplan sent the first car to run at the first race of the 1969 season at [[Jackson, Michigan]]. Kaplan sent one of the older 1968 cars with a new engine, but, because they were late and had not qualified, the team had to do some consensus building among the other racers to permit them to enter at all. When the SCCA agreed to let them run, they started last, but, within 10 laps, they were chasing Donohue down and the time differential was narrowing rapidly. After the race, the SCCA asked to see the engine, but he had sent the cars home already. At Lime Rock, the SCCA wanted to tear down the engines before they could start the race. Kaplan bought some time by countering with the challenge that they would have to tear down the Camaros and Mustangs too. That was not going to happen, so they were allowed to run. It was clear, however, that the problems with the SCCA were not going away, at least until the parts could be homologated.\n\nAMC did eventually assign a part number (after the SCCA program) and two blocks were later sold to customers.\n\nFor 1969, the season started with Ron Grable (#4) and John Martin (#3). But this time, it was Martin who was released mid-season. Jerry Grant replaced him in the No. 3 car.\n\nIt was at this point that Kaplan approached AMC management and proposed that the concept behind the 1969 contract be modified. He suggested that AMC should not compete in the actual races, since the new engines were not recognized and the old engines were not competitive. Kaplan suggested that they instead go to the tracks on the subsequent Mondays and run a developmental program using Sunday's winning times as the benchmark. AMC did not agree, and Kaplan ran the year with the engines on hand. Because the older-style engines were not competitive, results were poor and, to add insult to injury, there were a series of budget cuts. It was a downward spiral.\n\nKaplan was having trouble remaining calm about the situation and, after the final race at Riverside, decided he would drop all of AMC's material at their zone office in [[El Segundo, California]], and take a month to think about the next year. When he came back, he found that a deal had already been cut with Roger Penske, and he was out.\n\nPenske picked up the team cars and equipment from the El Segundo offices and shipped everything back to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found that Ron Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but he felt that the front suspension could still be further developed. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske's team lowered the front of the car and replaced the rubber bushings in the radius rods with [[Rod end bearing|heim joints]].

The VAM versions were equipped with different, locally made components, trim and interiors than the equivalent AMC-made models.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam2.html |title=Arcticboy's VAM page 2, 1972 Javelin brochure |first=Bob |last=Wilson |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}</ref> The Mexican built Javelins came in only one version and had more standard equipment compared to U.S. and Canadian models. The Javelin was the first VAM model not to carry the Rambler name for Mexico, AMC's case being the Marlin and Ambassador models in 1966.\n\n====1968====\nThe Javelin wasn't introduced in Mexico by VAM until 1 April 1968, making the model a \"1968 and half\" similar to the February 1968 debut of the two-seat AMX. The Javelin represented a third line within VAM's product mix for the first time and the first regular production high-end sports-oriented model. It would eventually become the only AMC muscle car to be available in Mexico. Other AMC muscle cars were equivalents built by VAM or as special editions, such as the 1979 American 06/S taking the place of the 1971 Hornet SC/360, the 1972 Classic Brougham hardtop taking the place of the 1970 Rebel Machine and 1971 Matador Machine plus the 1969 Shelby Rambler Go Pack the place of the 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler. The Javelin introduced many firsts for VAM, such as a standard four-speed manual transmission and the option for the first time in a regular production model of a three-speed automatic transmission. These were the only transmissions available on the Javelin and only with floor-mounted shifters, just as on the two-seater AMX. Cars with the automatic included a center console with locking compartment, as well as power [[drum brake]]s at no extra cost.\n\nThe 1968 VAM Javelin featured the {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 8.5:1 compression ratio {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine with two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor, a 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio, 12-inch heavy duty clutch, manual four-wheel drum brakes, quick-ratio manual steering, electric wipers, electric washers, 8,000 RPM tachometer, 200&nbsp;km/h speedometer, AM radio, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, courtesy lights, day-night rearview mirror, padded sun visors, two-point front seatbelts, low-back reclining bucket seats, rear ashtray, dual C-pillar-mounted dome lights, dual coat hooks, sports steering wheel, driver's side remote mirror, side armrests, vinyl door panels with woodgrain accents, bright moldings on top of the doors and rocker panels plus hood and fender extension edges, wheel covers, 7.35x14 tires, protective side moldings, and front fender-mounted Javelin emblems.\n\nThe standard trim and features make the VAM Javelin equivalent to the U.S. and Canadian AMC Javelin SST. Factory options included power drum brakes with manual transmission, power steering, heater, passenger's side remote mirror, remote controlled driver's side mirror, custom sport wheels and rear bumper guards. Dealer installed options included side decals, light group, map pouches, vinyl roof, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, AM/FM radio, front disk brakes, heavy duty adjustable shocks, trunk lid rack, and many others.\n\nA unique dealer-installed option also VAM's own \"Go Pack\". This consisted of manual front disk brakes, heavy duty suspension with front sway bar plus rear torsion and traction bars, aluminum four-barrel intake manifold with four-barrel Carter carburetor, headers with equal-length tubes and dual final outlets, dual exhausts, ported head with larger valves and heavy duty springs, 302 degree camshaft, Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, \"Rallye Pak\" auxiliary gauges on dashboard (different from AMC's original units), exclusive steering wheel, exclusive dual remote mirrors, and exclusive turbine wheels. The performance upgrades of the Go Pack represented a 40% increase of engine output making the VAM Javelin far more competitive against its V8 rivals from ''Ford de M\u00e9xico'', ''General Motors de M\u00e9xico'', and Automex (''Chrysler de M\u00e9xico'').\n\nDespite the lack of a V8 engine, the VAM Javelin was a success in both sales and among public opinion.\n\n====1969====\nThe 1969 VAM Javelin obtained the previously optional heater as standard equipment, the foot pedals received bright trim and the accelerator was changed into a firewall-mounted unit, a support pull strap was applied on the passenger's side dashboard above the glove box, the center cover with the radio speaker grid changed into a woodgrain unit. A unique aspect of the 1969 Javelin is that it kept the same gauge configuration as the 1968 models in contrast to AMC's modifications to the Javelin (and AMX) instrument panel for 1969 with a larger 8,000 RPM tach on the right pod, leaving the smaller left pod exclusive for the clock. The VAM Javelins exterior now had bright trim package with new moldings starting at the corners of the tail lights running on the sides all the way to lower rear corner of the side glass and drip rails plus all around the rear glass and top edge of the C-pillars. The new Javelins looked more luxurious, even though a factory vinyl roof was not available. The front fender emblems were relocated to the base of each C-pillar and were accompanied by red-white-blue bulls eye emblems. A third Javelin emblem was applied near the lower right corner of the grille. The 1969 model year was also VAM's first self-engineered engine, the {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 9.5:1 [[compression ratio]] {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine with a two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor and a new VAM-engineered 266-degree camshaft. In both standard and Go Pack versions.\n\n====1970====\nThe VAM Javelin saw considerable aesthetic changes with only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, such as new headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector in favor of the back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present in the form of the floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.\n\nThe 1970 VAM Javelins received a new front suspension design with dual control arms and ball joints. Units with four-speed manual transmissions incorporated a Hurst linkage as factory-installed equipment, which was previously available only with the optional Go Pack package and separately in certain dealerships. A mid-year change replaced the imported Borg-Warner T10 manual transmission in favor of the Quer\u00e9taro-produced TREMEC 170-F four-speed model to comply with the percentages of both local and imported equipment mandated by law.<ref name=\"forum-mexico\">{{cite web|url=http://amccars.net/cgi/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1231916734 |title=VAM Mexican Javelin History and Trivia |date=14 January 2009 |author=Mauricio Jord\u00e1n |publisher=The AMC Forum |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====1971====\nThe year of 1971 was vital to VAM as it represented a complete turn around for the company. The new Camioneta Rambler American based on the Hornet Sportabout was introduced, the Rambler Classic obtained all characteristics of AMC's new Matador, and the Javelin was restyled as a new generation. On the outside, the car was exactly the same as its AMC counterpart with the only exception of the wheels and the lack of factory stripes and decals. A unique characteristic of the second generation VAM Javelin was round porthole opera windows mounted on the C-pillars installed by some VAM dealerships either with or without vinyl roofs.\n\nThe standard engine was the new {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 9.5:1 compression ratio {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM's second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine took the car to its zenith in terms of performance. The new engine was announced by two \"4.6\" emblems on both front fenders. The only other technical difference of the new version was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for units equipped with automatic transmission. The interior saw more changes starting with all-new non-reclining high-back bucket seats with built-in \"J\" emblems on the seat backs as well as on the center of the rear seat back. The dashboard was restricted to the unit with woodgrain overlays only; the instrument cluster was once again completely different from the AMC Javelins. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was tuned for six cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240&nbsp;km/h speedometer, a range that put it on par as an equivalent to AMC's 140 MHP unit of the Rallye Pak; but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between the speedometer and the clock/tack hybrid. On the left pod were the fuel and water temperature gauges with no oil pressure and ammeter gauges present. Like the AMC Javelins, the car now held a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake pedal design for units with automatic transmission.\n\n====1972====\nAll the quality and engineering upgrades and revisions seen on AMC cars for 1972 were also present in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements in terms of both performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard equipment list, as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of transmission. Units equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The \"Shift-Command\" Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new \"Torque Command\" Chrysler-built A998 [[TorqueFlite]]. The chromed grille applied on the tail light lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an \"American Motors\" legend on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.\n\n====1973====\nFor the 1973 model year, the VAM Javelin received cosmetic changes. The car incorporated the new smaller rectangular grille design with integrated rectangular parking lights and mesh grille, open air vents under the front of the fenders for cooling the brakes, the \"TV screen\" tail light design with a larger central bulls eye emblem between them and new original seat patterns. Mechanically, the car was the same as in the year before with the only exception of a new engine head design with larger valves and independent rockers without flute-type shaft. Except for the lack of intake porting, these heads were same units used in the Go Pack engines. These were the most powerful VAM Javelins ever made in stock condition. Similarly to the Mexican originals, the second-generation Javelins were not available with cowl induction hoods as the AMC Javelins in any form. Sales of this year went down from the previous seasons and the beginning of engine emission certification scheduled by the Mexican government the following year would take toll on all high-compression gasoline engines produced in the country. This started to threaten not just the Javelin, but all performance cars produced in Mexico. All this plus the need to open a space to introduce the Gremlin line and the company's perception that new Matador coupe model could take the position as the image builder and enthusiast generator of the marque prompted VAM to discontinue the Javelin at the end of the 1973 model year production, one year before AMC's production of the Javelin ended in the U.S.<ref name=\"forum-mexico\"/>\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nConstructora Venezolana de Veh\u00edculos C.A. was a subsidiary of AMC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Directory of American firms operating in foreign countries |page=932 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHaxAAAAIAAJ&q=%22American+Motors%22+Venezolana |title=Who owns whom: North America |publisher=Dun & Bradstreet |year=1982|page=12 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The firm assembled AMC Javelins from 1968 to 1974 in its [[Caracas]], Venezuela facility.\n\nThe Venezuelan 1968 Javelin was equipped with the {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine.

Luzon Machineries later assembled the 1968\u20131970 AMC Javelin. The Javelin was one of only two \"pony cars\" to ever be available in the Philippines, the other being the Chevrolet Camaro. The Philippine-assembled Javelin came with AMC's 258 cu in 6 cylinder engine only. In 1970 Luzon Machineries began to cease passenger vehicle manufacturing and for 1970 only a dozen Javelins were produced.<ref>https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/musclecarsphfr/amc-javelin-t1803.html</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nAmerican Motors exported factory right-hand-drive vehicles to the United Kingdom which were built at the Brampton plant in Ontario, Canada.

For 1968, three cars were actually constructed: two for racing and one for shows and demonstrations. In 1969, Jeffords left the team and Kaplan was contracted to run the program. Using his developmental work from the prior year, Kaplan built three more cars, two for AMC and one for himself using his own finances.\n\nFor 1968, the initial drivers had been George Follmer (#1) and Peter Revson (#2). Revson was let go part way through the year after a disagreement with management. The team picked up Lothar Motschenbacher for the next two races in Canada.\n\nThe first year of the AMC program was a success; the team was written up as a \"Cinderella\" team. American Motors placed third in the over-2-liter class of the 1968 series,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.trans-amseries.com/results/1968.pdf |title=1968 TRANS-AM Box Scores |publisher=SSCA news |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}</ref> and established a record as the only factory entry to finish every Trans-Am race entered.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.amx-perience.com/Trans_Am_Racing_1968.php |title=Trans-Am Racing 1968 |publisher=AMX-perience |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141004223243/http://amx-perience.com/Trans_Am_Racing_1968.php |archivedate=4 October 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2014}}\nFor 1968, the team had consistently improved and suffered only one DNF (did not finish) from an engine problem. The race program was supporting a company that had no performance parts, no test facility, and no technical support for the program. As for the production cars, they had no anti-dive potential built into the uni-body; only single-barrel carburetor manifolds; and even when running properly, they did not make as much horsepower as the competitors. The 1968 deal provided Jeffords and Kaplan support from Carl Chakmakian, who was the primary contact on the AMC program.\n\nThe performance of the team in 1968 can be attributed to the efforts of Kaplan, his staff, and help from other west coast manufacturers. Kaplan set out to resolve handling problems and fix engine oiling problems. Mid-season, he also started the development of a dual-carburetor cross-ram manifold and (looking ahead) a new engine casting.\n\nThe development of the [[Watt's linkage]] rear suspension came first. This was followed by the front anti-dive modifications. The development of the anti-dive geometry was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC's schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang's 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the unibody on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building performance parts for Ford.\n\nThe building of reliable and powerful engines took a bit more time. The team started the 1968 season with two engines from TRACO. Although TRACO had worked hard to resolve oiling issues and to generate as much power as they could, single-carb layout and the basic two-bolt-main block were serious limitations.\n\nTo develop a cross-ram manifold, Kaplan went to Vic Edelbrock, who not only loaned him a pattern maker but also gave him a lot of personal help. Kaplan was also helped by [[Champion (spark plug)|Champion Spark Plugs]] who let him use their dyno room to fine-tune and correct any design problems.\n\nTowards the end of 1968, Kaplan enlisted help from Dan Byer, a retired engineer from AMC, for the development of a new block casting. Using the basic AMC 390 drawings, they added more mass for four-bolt mains and improved the oiling system. A run of 50 blocks was contracted to Central Foundries in Windsor, Ontario. Because this was a small run, and there was little factory support, it fell to Kaplan and his staff to clean up the blocks from the sand casting, hone the various passages and, finally, send them to AMC's \"Parts Central\" in Kenosha. From there, they could draw on the inventory, as required.\n\nIf one were to put a small number of specially cast blocks into the general inventory, chances are pretty good that they would be difficult to find them again, so Kaplan painted all the blocks in a bright orange so they could identify them on the transfer line. Kaplan drew on about 12 of these special castings during his development program and two were eventually (much later) sold to customers.\n\nKaplan's specific preparations included shaving the deck on the new block by about 5/8 inch and heavily modifying the ports. The new cross-ram manifold was installed and Kaplan would add his own specifically designed pistons, a shorter throw crankshaft and new camshaft. While a few engines were lost during testing, the whole design proved quite reliable.\n\nIn the intervening period, AMC replaced Kaplan's race program contact with two new men (Chris Schoenlip and John Voelbel from Lever Brothers (soap marketing people)), who had no experience in the automotive field and were ignorant of anything to do with racing. They would ultimately prove to be more trouble than they were worth. In fact, it was these two new boys who failed to enter the parts into the official AMC parts system and to submit homologation papers. The importance of this mistake became clear when Kaplan sent the first car to run at the first race of the 1969 season at [[Jackson, Michigan]]. Kaplan sent one of the older 1968 cars with a new engine, but, because they were late and had not qualified, the team had to do some consensus building among the other racers to permit them to enter at all. When the SCCA agreed to let them run, they started last, but, within 10 laps, they were chasing Donohue down and the time differential was narrowing rapidly. After the race, the SCCA asked to see the engine, but he had sent the cars home already. At Lime Rock, the SCCA wanted to tear down the engines before they could start the race. Kaplan bought some time by countering with the challenge that they would have to tear down the Camaros and Mustangs too. That was not going to happen, so they were allowed to run. It was clear, however, that the problems with the SCCA were not going away, at least until the parts could be homologated.\n\nAMC did eventually assign a part number (after the SCCA program) and two blocks were later sold to customers.\n\nFor 1969, the season started with Ron Grable (#4) and John Martin (#3). But this time, it was Martin who was released mid-season. Jerry Grant replaced him in the No. 3 car.\n\nIt was at this point that Kaplan approached AMC management and proposed that the concept behind the 1969 contract be modified. He suggested that AMC should not compete in the actual races, since the new engines were not recognized and the old engines were not competitive. Kaplan suggested that they instead go to the tracks on the subsequent Mondays and run a developmental program using Sunday's winning times as the benchmark. AMC did not agree, and Kaplan ran the year with the engines on hand. Because the older-style engines were not competitive, results were poor and, to add insult to injury, there were a series of budget cuts. It was a downward spiral.\n\nKaplan was having trouble remaining calm about the situation and, after the final race at Riverside, decided he would drop all of AMC's material at their zone office in [[El Segundo, California]], and take a month to think about the next year. When he came back, he found that a deal had already been cut with Roger Penske, and he was out.\n\nPenske picked up the team cars and equipment from the El Segundo offices and shipped everything back to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found that Ron Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but he felt that the front suspension could still be further developed. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske's team lowered the front of the car and replaced the rubber bushings in the radius rods with [[Rod end bearing|heim joints]]. New roll bars were also developed. After several months of development, Donohue felt that the team now had car that drove like it was on rails.\n\nAt this point, Penske built all-new cars for his own team and sold all the earlier Kaplan cars and equipment. Mark Donohue was in charge of selling off the inventory.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Redesign==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name= 1970\n|image =1970 AMC Javelin SST in bitter sweet orange.jpg\n|caption= 1970 AMC Javelin SST with \"Go Package\"\n|production=August 1969 \u2013 July 1970\n|aka=Rambler Javelin (Australia)<br>VAM Javelin (Mexico)\n|engine =\n* {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] {{convert|145|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 1-bbl or {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-bbl\n* {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-bbl (Mexico only)\n* {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] 2-bbl {{convert|225|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n* {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 {{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-bbl or {{convert|285|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-bbl\n* {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|transmission =3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual<br />3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />3-speed \"Shift-Command\" on console\n|wheelbase = {{convert|109|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length= {{convert|191.04|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height =\n|weight =\n}}\n\n===1970===\nThe 1970 Javelins featured a new front-end design with a wide \"twin-venturi\" front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood.

The VAM versions were equipped with different, locally made components, trim and interiors than the equivalent AMC-made models.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam2.html |title=Arcticboy's VAM page 2, 1972 Javelin brochure |first=Bob |last=Wilson |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}</ref> The Mexican built Javelins came in only one version and had more standard equipment compared to U.S. and Canadian models. The Javelin was the first VAM model not to carry the Rambler name for Mexico, AMC's case being the Marlin and Ambassador models in 1966.\n\n====1968====\nThe Javelin wasn't introduced in Mexico by VAM until 1 April 1968, making the model a \"1968 and half\" similar to the February 1968 debut of the two-seat AMX. The Javelin represented a third line within VAM's product mix for the first time and the first regular production high-end sports-oriented model. It would eventually become the only AMC muscle car to be available in Mexico. Other AMC muscle cars were equivalents built by VAM or as special editions, such as the 1979 American 06/S taking the place of the 1971 Hornet SC/360, the 1972 Classic Brougham hardtop taking the place of the 1970 Rebel Machine and 1971 Matador Machine plus the 1969 Shelby Rambler Go Pack the place of the 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler. The Javelin introduced many firsts for VAM, such as a standard four-speed manual transmission and the option for the first time in a regular production model of a three-speed automatic transmission. These were the only transmissions available on the Javelin and only with floor-mounted shifters, just as on the two-seater AMX. Cars with the automatic included a center console with locking compartment, as well as power [[drum brake]]s at no extra cost.\n\nThe 1968 VAM Javelin featured the {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 8.5:1 compression ratio {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine with two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor, a 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio, 12-inch heavy duty clutch, manual four-wheel drum brakes, quick-ratio manual steering, electric wipers, electric washers, 8,000 RPM tachometer, 200&nbsp;km/h speedometer, AM radio, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, courtesy lights, day-night rearview mirror, padded sun visors, two-point front seatbelts, low-back reclining bucket seats, rear ashtray, dual C-pillar-mounted dome lights, dual coat hooks, sports steering wheel, driver's side remote mirror, side armrests, vinyl door panels with woodgrain accents, bright moldings on top of the doors and rocker panels plus hood and fender extension edges, wheel covers, 7.35x14 tires, protective side moldings, and front fender-mounted Javelin emblems.\n\nThe standard trim and features make the VAM Javelin equivalent to the U.S. and Canadian AMC Javelin SST. Factory options included power drum brakes with manual transmission, power steering, heater, passenger's side remote mirror, remote controlled driver's side mirror, custom sport wheels and rear bumper guards. Dealer installed options included side decals, light group, map pouches, vinyl roof, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, AM/FM radio, front disk brakes, heavy duty adjustable shocks, trunk lid rack, and many others.\n\nA unique dealer-installed option also VAM's own \"Go Pack\". This consisted of manual front disk brakes, heavy duty suspension with front sway bar plus rear torsion and traction bars, aluminum four-barrel intake manifold with four-barrel Carter carburetor, headers with equal-length tubes and dual final outlets, dual exhausts, ported head with larger valves and heavy duty springs, 302 degree camshaft, Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, \"Rallye Pak\" auxiliary gauges on dashboard (different from AMC's original units), exclusive steering wheel, exclusive dual remote mirrors, and exclusive turbine wheels. The performance upgrades of the Go Pack represented a 40% increase of engine output making the VAM Javelin far more competitive against its V8 rivals from ''Ford de M\u00e9xico'', ''General Motors de M\u00e9xico'', and Automex (''Chrysler de M\u00e9xico'').\n\nDespite the lack of a V8 engine, the VAM Javelin was a success in both sales and among public opinion.\n\n====1969====\nThe 1969 VAM Javelin obtained the previously optional heater as standard equipment, the foot pedals received bright trim and the accelerator was changed into a firewall-mounted unit, a support pull strap was applied on the passenger's side dashboard above the glove box, the center cover with the radio speaker grid changed into a woodgrain unit. A unique aspect of the 1969 Javelin is that it kept the same gauge configuration as the 1968 models in contrast to AMC's modifications to the Javelin (and AMX) instrument panel for 1969 with a larger 8,000 RPM tach on the right pod, leaving the smaller left pod exclusive for the clock. The VAM Javelins exterior now had bright trim package with new moldings starting at the corners of the tail lights running on the sides all the way to lower rear corner of the side glass and drip rails plus all around the rear glass and top edge of the C-pillars. The new Javelins looked more luxurious, even though a factory vinyl roof was not available. The front fender emblems were relocated to the base of each C-pillar and were accompanied by red-white-blue bulls eye emblems. A third Javelin emblem was applied near the lower right corner of the grille. The 1969 model year was also VAM's first self-engineered engine, the {{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 9.5:1 [[compression ratio]] {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine with a two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor and a new VAM-engineered 266-degree camshaft. In both standard and Go Pack versions.\n\n====1970====\nThe VAM Javelin saw considerable aesthetic changes with only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, such as new headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector in favor of the back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present in the form of the floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.\n\nThe 1970 VAM Javelins received a new front suspension design with dual control arms and ball joints. Units with four-speed manual transmissions incorporated a Hurst linkage as factory-installed equipment, which was previously available only with the optional Go Pack package and separately in certain dealerships. A mid-year change replaced the imported Borg-Warner T10 manual transmission in favor of the Quer\u00e9taro-produced TREMEC 170-F four-speed model to comply with the percentages of both local and imported equipment mandated by law.<ref name=\"forum-mexico\">{{cite web|url=http://amccars.net/cgi/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1231916734 |title=VAM Mexican Javelin History and Trivia |date=14 January 2009 |author=Mauricio Jord\u00e1n |publisher=The AMC Forum |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====1971====\nThe year of 1971 was vital to VAM as it represented a complete turn around for the company. The new Camioneta Rambler American based on the Hornet Sportabout was introduced, the Rambler Classic obtained all characteristics of AMC's new Matador, and the Javelin was restyled as a new generation. On the outside, the car was exactly the same as its AMC counterpart with the only exception of the wheels and the lack of factory stripes and decals. A unique characteristic of the second generation VAM Javelin was round porthole opera windows mounted on the C-pillars installed by some VAM dealerships either with or without vinyl roofs.\n\nThe standard engine was the new {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, 9.5:1 compression ratio {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM's second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine took the car to its zenith in terms of performance. The new engine was announced by two \"4.6\" emblems on both front fenders. The only other technical difference of the new version was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for units equipped with automatic transmission. The interior saw more changes starting with all-new non-reclining high-back bucket seats with built-in \"J\" emblems on the seat backs as well as on the center of the rear seat back. The dashboard was restricted to the unit with woodgrain overlays only; the instrument cluster was once again completely different from the AMC Javelins. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was tuned for six cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240&nbsp;km/h speedometer, a range that put it on par as an equivalent to AMC's 140 MHP unit of the Rallye Pak; but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between the speedometer and the clock/tack hybrid. On the left pod were the fuel and water temperature gauges with no oil pressure and ammeter gauges present. Like the AMC Javelins, the car now held a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake pedal design for units with automatic transmission.\n\n====1972====\nAll the quality and engineering upgrades and revisions seen on AMC cars for 1972 were also present in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements in terms of both performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard equipment list, as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of transmission. Units equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The \"Shift-Command\" Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new \"Torque Command\" Chrysler-built A998 [[TorqueFlite]]. The chromed grille applied on the tail light lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an \"American Motors\" legend on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.\n\n====1973====\nFor the 1973 model year, the VAM Javelin received cosmetic changes. The car incorporated the new smaller rectangular grille design with integrated rectangular parking lights and mesh grille, open air vents under the front of the fenders for cooling the brakes, the \"TV screen\" tail light design with a larger central bulls eye emblem between them and new original seat patterns. Mechanically, the car was the same as in the year before with the only exception of a new engine head design with larger valves and independent rockers without flute-type shaft. Except for the lack of intake porting, these heads were same units used in the Go Pack engines. These were the most powerful VAM Javelins ever made in stock condition. Similarly to the Mexican originals, the second-generation Javelins were not available with cowl induction hoods as the AMC Javelins in any form. Sales of this year went down from the previous seasons and the beginning of engine emission certification scheduled by the Mexican government the following year would take toll on all high-compression gasoline engines produced in the country. This started to threaten not just the Javelin, but all performance cars produced in Mexico. All this plus the need to open a space to introduce the Gremlin line and the company's perception that new Matador coupe model could take the position as the image builder and enthusiast generator of the marque prompted VAM to discontinue the Javelin at the end of the 1973 model year production, one year before AMC's production of the Javelin ended in the U.S.<ref name=\"forum-mexico\"/>\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nConstructora Venezolana de Veh\u00edculos C.A. was a subsidiary of AMC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Directory of American firms operating in foreign countries |page=932 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHaxAAAAIAAJ&q=%22American+Motors%22+Venezolana |title=Who owns whom: North America |publisher=Dun & Bradstreet |year=1982|page=12 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> The firm assembled AMC Javelins from 1968 to 1974 in its [[Caracas]], Venezuela facility.\n\nThe Venezuelan 1968 Javelin was equipped with the {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine.

Luzon Machineries later assembled the 1968\u20131970 AMC Javelin. The Javelin was one of only two \"pony cars\" to ever be available in the Philippines, the other being the Chevrolet Camaro. The Philippine-assembled Javelin came with AMC's 258 cu in 6 cylinder engine only. In 1970 Luzon Machineries began to cease passenger vehicle manufacturing and for 1970 only a dozen Javelins were produced.<ref>https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/musclecarsphfr/amc-javelin-t1803.html</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nAmerican Motors exported factory right-hand-drive vehicles to the United Kingdom which were built at the Brampton plant in Ontario, Canada.

It received [[List of accolades received by First Man|numerous accolades]], including two nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] (winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]), ten nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning Best Editing and Best Score), seven nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], and four nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] (winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1961, [[NASA]] test pilot [[Neil Armstrong]] is flying the [[X-15]] rocket-powered spaceplane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he manages to land the plane in the [[Mojave Desert]], his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction, and he is grounded.\n\nHis 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Desperate to save her, Armstrong keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Armstrong applies for [[Project Gemini]] and is accepted to [[NASA Astronaut Group 2]]. Armstrong, his wife Janet, and their son Rick move to Houston alongside other astronaut families. Armstrong befriends [[Elliot See]], another civilian test pilot, and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]. As Armstrong begins training, [[Deke Slayton]] impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the [[Soviet Union]] had reached every milestone in the [[Space Race]] ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark.\n\nBy 1965, the family has settled in Houston, and Armstrong awaits selection for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be the commander of [[Gemini 8]], with [[David Scott (astronaut)|David Scott]] as the pilot. Prior to the mission, See and [[Charles Bassett]] are killed in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash]], deepening Armstrong's grief at the string of recent losses. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on [[Gemini 8]] and dock with the [[Agena target vehicle]], but soon afterward, the spacecraft begins to roll at a rapid rate. After nearly blacking out, Armstrong activates the [[Reaction control system|RCS]] thrusters and safely aborts the mission. Armstrong initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault. Later, White reveals that he has been selected for the [[Apollo 1]] mission, along with [[Gus Grissom]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]].\n\nDuring a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a [[Apollo_1#Fire|fire kills White and the Apollo 1 crew]], and Armstrong hears the news while representing NASA at the [[White House]]. The next year, after ejecting from the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] in an accident that could have killed him, Armstrong is selected to command [[Apollo 11]], and Slayton informs him that it will likely be the first lunar landing. As the mission nears, Neil becomes increasingly preoccupied and emotionally distant from his family. Just prior to the launch, Janet confronts Armstrong about the possibility that he might not survive the flight and insists that he should explain the risks of the mission to their young sons. After telling them about the risks he faces, Armstrong says goodbye to his family.\n\nApollo 11 reaches the Moon four days later. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and attempt the landing. They realize that they are coming in too fast and are going to overshoot their designated landing site. The new landing site turns out to have much rougher terrain, forcing Armstrong to take manual control of the spacecraft. He lands the lunar module successfully with less than 30 seconds of fuel remaining. After setting foot on the Moon, Armstrong utters his famous line, \"That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Later he drops Karen's bracelet into [[Little West (lunar crater)|Little West crater]]. With their mission complete, the astronauts return home and are placed in [[quarantine]], where the film of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1962 speech \"[[We choose to go to the Moon]]\" is shown, and Armstrong and Janet share a moment of tenderness.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as [[Neil Armstrong]], the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon during [[Apollo 11]].\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife.\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], Neil's friend and neighbor, the first American to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]], who died during a pre-launch test for [[Apollo 1]], which was to be the first crewed Apollo mission.\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as [[Deke Slayton]], one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts, who became NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]].\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as [[Buzz Aldrin]], the second man to walk on the Moon during Apollo 11.\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as [[Elliot See]], partnered with Armstrong as backup crew for [[Gemini 5]].

Instead, [[LED display]]s of up to 10 meters were used. These projected images that would simulate the exterior of the spacecraft, both the earth and space. Next to the screens, several simulators were built, each corresponding to a spacecraft. These were programmed to move synchronized with the images of the spherical LED screens that could be seen through the windows. Chazelle chose this technique because it allowed the actors to get more into the role; instead of seeing a green screen, they saw the outside environment recreated with [[visual effects]]. [[Scale model|Miniatures]] were used for several exterior shots of the spacecraft.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTo recreate Armstrong's home, the production crew built a replica of it in an empty lot.

It received [[List of accolades received by First Man|numerous accolades]], including two nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] (winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]), ten nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning Best Editing and Best Score), seven nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], and four nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] (winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1961, [[NASA]] test pilot [[Neil Armstrong]] is flying the [[X-15]] rocket-powered spaceplane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he manages to land the plane in the [[Mojave Desert]], his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction, and he is grounded.\n\nHis 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Desperate to save her, Armstrong keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Armstrong applies for [[Project Gemini]] and is accepted to [[NASA Astronaut Group 2]]. Armstrong, his wife Janet, and their son Rick move to Houston alongside other astronaut families. Armstrong befriends [[Elliot See]], another civilian test pilot, and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]. As Armstrong begins training, [[Deke Slayton]] impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the [[Soviet Union]] had reached every milestone in the [[Space Race]] ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark.\n\nBy 1965, the family has settled in Houston, and Armstrong awaits selection for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be the commander of [[Gemini 8]], with [[David Scott (astronaut)|David Scott]] as the pilot. Prior to the mission, See and [[Charles Bassett]] are killed in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash]], deepening Armstrong's grief at the string of recent losses. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on [[Gemini 8]] and dock with the [[Agena target vehicle]], but soon afterward, the spacecraft begins to roll at a rapid rate. After nearly blacking out, Armstrong activates the [[Reaction control system|RCS]] thrusters and safely aborts the mission. Armstrong initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault. Later, White reveals that he has been selected for the [[Apollo 1]] mission, along with [[Gus Grissom]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]].\n\nDuring a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a [[Apollo_1#Fire|fire kills White and the Apollo 1 crew]] , and Armstrong hears the news while representing NASA at the [[White House]]. The next year, after ejecting from the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] in an accident that could have killed him, Armstrong is selected to command [[Apollo 11]], and Slayton informs him that it will likely be the first lunar landing. As the mission nears, Neil becomes increasingly preoccupied and emotionally distant from his family. Just prior to the launch, Janet confronts Armstrong about the possibility that he might not survive the flight and insists that he should explain the risks of the mission to their young sons. After telling them about the risks he faces, Armstrong says goodbye to his family.\n\nApollo 11 reaches the Moon four days later. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and attempt the landing. They realize that they are coming in too fast and are going to overshoot their designated landing site. The new landing site turns out to have much rougher terrain, forcing Armstrong to take manual control of the spacecraft. He lands the lunar module successfully with less than 30 seconds of fuel remaining. After setting foot on the Moon, Armstrong utters his famous line, \"That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Later he drops Karen's bracelet into [[Little West (lunar crater)|Little West crater]]. With their mission complete, the astronauts return home and are placed in [[quarantine]], where the film of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1962 speech \"[[We choose to go to the Moon]]\" is shown, and Armstrong and Janet share a moment of tenderness.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as [[Neil Armstrong]], the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon during [[Apollo 11]].\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife.\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], Neil's friend and neighbor, the first American to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]], who died during a pre-launch test for [[Apollo 1]], which was to be the first crewed Apollo mission.\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as [[Deke Slayton]], one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts, who became NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]].\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as [[Buzz Aldrin]], the second man to walk on the Moon during Apollo 11.\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as [[Elliot See]], partnered with Armstrong as backup crew for [[Gemini 5]].

Instead, [[LED display]]s of up to 10 meters were used. These projected images that would simulate the exterior of the spacecraft, both the earth and space. Next to the screens, several simulators were built, each corresponding to a spacecraft. These were programmed to move synchronized with the images of the spherical LED screens that could be seen through the windows. Chazelle chose this technique because it allowed the actors to get more into the role; instead of seeing a green screen, they saw the outside environment recreated with [[visual effects]]. [[Scale model|Miniatures]] were used for several exterior shots of the spacecraft.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTo recreate Armstrong's home, the production crew built a replica of it in an empty lot.

The purpose of the K-1 Visa is to allow time for the couple to make arrangements for and actually have the marriage ceremony.  The visa is not to give the couple time \"to decide IF\" they will marry. Each couple has already signed document(s) stating that they have promised to marry each other, and provided the signed document(s) to the US Immigration services to get the K-1 Visa. \n\nThe series debuted on January 12, 2014, and has been renewed through its seventh season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a27214674/90-day-fiance-season-7-news-cast-spoilers/|title=When Is a New Season of \u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 Coming?|last=Beck|first=Laura|date=2019-04-25|website=Cosmopolitan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe series currently has seven spin-offs: ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After]]'', which documents the ups and downs of past ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples after their marriage; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Before the 90 Days]],'' which follows couples that have met each other online, but have not yet started the K-1 visa process; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: What Now?]],'' an original digital series that gives updates on past 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 couples; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way]],'' a dedicated series to couples where the American partner permanently moves into their partner's home country instead of the foreign partner doing so; ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Pillow Talk]],'' a reaction show featuring a number of previous cast members that take part in reacting to an episode of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Happily Ever After; [[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#The Family Chantel|The Family Chantel]],'' focused on the relationship of ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' season four cast members Pedro and Chantel, and their immediate family; and ''[[90 Day Fianc\u00e9#90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined|90 Day Fianc\u00e9: Self-Quarantined]]'', which follows the lives of previous ''90 Day Fianc\u00e9'' couples during the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|2020 COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n==''K-1 visa process''==\n{{Main|K-1 visa}}\nThe show is based on the K-1 visa process, which begins with the petitioner meeting the beneficiary inside or outside the United States, then filing a I-129F petition with evidence of meeting and of a relationship. After the petition is approved, the petitioner must pass biometrics and then the process is sent to the foreign embassy of the beneficiary. The beneficiary then files for a visa, before or after passing the medical requirements and is called for an interview, in which the beneficiary must prove that they meet the requirements of the visa, including having strong evidence of meeting and a valid relationship. If approved, the foreign fianc\u00e9 travels to the States to live with his or her prospective American spouse. The couple must marry within 90 days, otherwise the beneficiary must leave the country. The couple may face language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of being thought of as a \"[[mail-order bride]]\" as well as skepticism of friends and family.  Professor Lenni B. Benson of the New York Law School has stated that  although the K-1 visa program is widely associated with [[sham marriage]]s, \"It is not true in the majority of cases.\" <ref>{{cite news |title=\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019: An Anti-Fantasy for Troubled Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/television/90-day-fiance-immigration.html |accessdate=20 August 2019 |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Season 1 cast==\n\n===Russ & Paola===\nRuss Mayfield (27, from [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]) met Paola \"Pao\" (26, from [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]]), a fashion designer, while he was in Colombia on a work assignment in the [[petroleum industry]].

Shortly after the wedding, Mohamed left Danielle. He went to Florida with a female friend, and Danielle saw intimate photos of them on social media and consulted a lawyer.

After the petition is approved, the petitioner must pass biometrics and then the process is sent to the foreign embassy of the beneficiary. The beneficiary then files for a visa, before or after passing the medical requirements and is called for an interview, in which the beneficiary must prove that they meet the requirements of the visa, including having strong evidence of meeting and a valid relationship. If approved, the foreign fianc\u00e9 travels to the States to live with his or her prospective American spouse. The couple must marry within 90 days, otherwise the beneficiary must leave the country. The couple may face language barriers, culture shock, the stigma of being thought of as a \"[[mail-order bride]]\" as well as skepticism of friends and family.  Professor Lenni B. Benson of the New York Law School has stated that  although the K-1 visa program is widely associated with [[sham marriage]]s, \"It is not true in the majority of cases.\"  <ref>{{cite news |title=\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019: An Anti-Fantasy for Troubled Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/television/90-day-fiance-immigration.html |accessdate=20 August 2019 |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Season 1 cast==\n\n===Russ & Paola===\nRuss Mayfield (27, from [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]) met Paola \"Pao\" (26, from [[Bucaramanga]], [[Colombia]]), a fashion designer, while he was in Colombia on a work assignment in the [[petroleum industry]].

By incorporating on-chip caches and a [[branch predictor]], it was declared NEC's [[Intel 486|486]] by ''[[Computer Business Review]]''.<ref name=\"CBR-1\"/><ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> The performance of V80 was two to four times than that of V70, depending on application. For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%. The launch prices of V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33&nbsp;MHz model and $960 for the 25&nbsp;MHz model. Supposedly a 45&nbsp;MHz model was scheduled for 1990,<ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> but did not materialize.\n\nThe V80, associated with \u03bcPD72691 co-FPP and \u03bcPD71101 simple [[peripheral]] chips, was used for [[Industrial PC|industrial computer]] with the [[RX-UX832]] real-time UNIX and a [[X Window System|X11-R4]] based window system.<ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-Jul92\"/><ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-May93\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|\u03bcPD72691|.mu.PD72691|D72691|AFPP}}AFPP (co&#8209;FPP) ==\n\nThe AFPP (\u03bcPD72691) /.mu.PD72691/ is a co-processor for floating point arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> The name stands for Advanced Floating Point Processor as is described in NEC's data sheet. The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz.

This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design.

The [[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|#4]] seems to be skipped (see page 58<ref name=\"cat95\"/>), probably because of Japanese [[tetraphobia]].

Three operating system functions, namely, the virtual memory support functions, context-switch functions, and asynchronous trap functions are examined. A basic mechanism for high-reliability-system implementation, called FRM (functional redundancy monitoring), is discussed. FRM allows a system to be designed in which multiple V60s (or V70s) form a configuration in which one processor in the system acts as a master while the others act as monitors.

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

A variety of techniques previously associated only with RISC (reduced-instruction-set computer) processors are used to execute the average instruction in 1.8 clocks. This represents a 2.5* reduction from its predecessor, the 386 microprocessor. The pipeline and clock count comparisons are described in detail. In addition, an onchip floating-point unit is included which yields a 4* clock count reduction from the 387 numeric coprocessor. The microarchitecture enhancements and optimizations used to achieve this goal, most of which are non-silicon-intensive, are discussed. All instructions of the 386 microprocessor and the 387 numeric coprocessor are implemented in a completely compatible fashion.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=J.H.|title=The i486 CPU: executing instructions in one clock cycle|journal=IEEE Micro|date=February 1990|volume=10|issue=1|pages=27\u201336|doi=10.1109/40.46766|issn=0272-1732|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.4216}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pj\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Hardenbergh |first1=Hal W | title=RISCs CISCs and Fabs|journal=Programmer's Journal|year=1988|publisher=Avant-Garde Creations|volume=6|issue=2|page=15|quote=<br/>So far we haven't mentioned two 32-bit CISC chips, the NEC V60/70 and the AT&T WE32 family.

Such trends called for a processor with both improved performance; by doubling the bus's width to 32 bits, and with flexibility; having large numbers of general-purpose registers.<ref name=\"maruzen\"/><ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> These were common features of [[Reduced instruction set computer|''Reduced Instruction Set Computer'']].<ref name=\"Computer-Architecture-4thEd\"/> At the time, this transition from [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] to [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] seemed to bring many benefits for emerging markets.\n\nToday, [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] chips are common, although the[[x86|Intel's x86]] CISC designs have been mainstream for several decades, the[[x86]] [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]], [[Intel 80486|80486]] internally adopts [[RISC]] features.<ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/>\nAccording to [[Pat Gelsinger]], binary backward compatibility for legacy software is much important than changing the ISA.<ref name=\"CNET-2007\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|V60|D70616|\u03bcPD70616|.mu.PD70616}}Overview ==\n\n=== Instruction set ===\n\nThe V60 (\u03bcPD70616) /.mu.PD70616/ retained a [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architecture.<ref name=\"Wade, 1996\"/> Its manual describes them as being[[Mainframe computer|mainframe-computer]]-based, with a fully [[orthogonal instruction set]], comprising; non-uniform length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex operand addressing schemes.<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/><ref name=\"maruzen\"/><ref name=\"Computer-Architecture-4thEd\"/>\n\n=== Family ===\n\nThe V60 operates as a 32 bit processor internally, whilst externally providing 16 bit data and 24 bits address buses. In addition, the V60 has 32 (32-bit) general-purpose registers.<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/>{{rp|\u00a71}}\nIts basic [[Computer architecture|architecture]] is used in several variants. The V70 (\u03bcPD70632), released in 1987, provides 32 bit external buses. Launched in 1989, the V80 (\u03bcPD70832)<ref name=\"overview\"/> is the culmination of the series; having on-chip caches, a branch predictor and less reliance on [[microcode]] for complex operations.<ref name=\"micro1990\"/>\n\n=== Software ===\n\nThe [[operating system]] developed for the V60-V80 series, are generally oriented toward [[Real-time operating system|real-time operation]]s.

It requires multiple devices of the same model,  one of which then becomes the \"master mode,\" while the other devices listen to the master device in the \"checker mode.\" If two or more devices output different result via their \"fault output\" pins simultaneously, a majority voting decision can be made by external circuits.

By incorporating on-chip caches and a [[branch predictor]], it was declared NEC's [[Intel 486|486]] by ''[[Computer Business Review]]''.<ref name=\"CBR-1\"/><ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> The performance of V80 was two to four times than that of V70, depending on application. For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%. The launch prices of V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33&nbsp;MHz model and $960 for the 25&nbsp;MHz model. Supposedly a 45&nbsp;MHz model was scheduled for 1990,<ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> but did not materialize.\n\nThe V80, associated with \u03bcPD72691 co-FPP and \u03bcPD71101 simple [[peripheral]] chips, was used for [[Industrial PC|industrial computer]] with the [[RX-UX832]] real-time UNIX and a [[X Window System|X11-R4]] based window system.<ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-Jul92\"/><ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-May93\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|\u03bcPD72691|.mu.PD72691|D72691|AFPP}}AFPP (co&#8209;FPP) ==\n\nThe AFPP (\u03bcPD72691) /.mu.PD72691/ is a co-processor for floating point arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> The name stands for Advanced Floating Point Processor as is described in NEC's data sheet. The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz. It was [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 1.2-micrometer double-metal layer CMOS process containing 433,000 transistors on an {{nowrap|11.6 \u00d7 14.9 mm<sup>2</sup>}} die.<ref name=\"coproc\"/> It was packaged in a 68-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]]. This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

What developer need is a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]], self as well as [[Cross compiler|cross]], and the [[Debugger#Debugger front-ends|screen debugger]], working with the target device, such as [[GNU Debugger#Graphical user interface|GDB-Tk]].\n\n=== IE-V60 ===\n\nThe IE-V60 was the first ''in-circuit emulator'' for V60 manufactured by NEC.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design. NEC might be able to throw away its [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]], and to reconsider in [[register-transfer level]] as soon as possible, but it did not.\n\n=== Fading ===\nThe V60-V80 architecture did not enjoy much commercial success.<ref name=\"Meth\u00e91991\"/>\n\nThe V60, V70, and V80 were listed in 1989 and 1990 NEC catalogs in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] packaging.<ref name=\"cat89\"/><ref name=\"cat90\"/> A NEC catalog from 1995 still listed the V60 and V70 (not only in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] version but also in a [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] packaging, and also included a low-cost variant of the V60 named \u03bcPD70615, which eliminated V20/V30 emulation and FRM function), alongside their assorted chipset, but the V80 is not offered in this catalog.<ref name=\"cat95\"/> The 1999 edition of the same catalog no longer has any V60-V80 products.<ref name=\"cat99\"/>\n\n=== {{anchor|NEC V810|NEC V820|NEC V830|\u03bcPD70732|\u03bcPD70742}}The V800&nbsp;Series ===\n\nIn 1992, NEC launched new model, the V800&nbsp;Series 32-bit [[microcontroller]], but it did not have [[Memory management unit|MMU (Memory Management Unit)]].<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\"/> It had [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]-based architecture, inspired by the [[Intel i960]], [[MIPS architecture]], and other [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] processor instructions, such as JARL (Jump and Register Link), and [[load/store architecture]].\n\nAt this moment, all the huge software assets of the V60/V70, like real-time Unix, were lost and never returned to their successors. The scenario Intel circumvents.\n\nThe V800&nbsp;Series had 3 product line variants, the V810&nbsp;Family, the V830&nbsp;Family, and the [[V850|V850&nbsp;Family]].<ref name=\"EDN\"/><ref name=\"IEIEC-1995\"/><ref name=\"IEEE-1998\"/>\n\nV820 (\u03bcPD70742) was a simple variant of V810 (\u03bcPD70732) with peripherals. The [[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|#4]] seems to be skipped (see page 58 <ref name=\"cat95\"/>), probably because of Japanese [[tetraphobia]].  One [[Japanese pronunciation]] of \"4\" means \"death.\" Thus, avoid naming the successors as the [[Deathwatch beetle|Death-watch]]; Shi-ban (#4; Shi-ban) ''[[Software bug|Bug]]'' ({{nihongo2|[[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|\u6b7b\u756a\u866b]]}}, precisely ''[[deathwatch beetle]]''). As of 2005, it was already the [[V850]] era, and the [[V850]]&nbsp;Family has been enjoying great success.<ref name=\"cat05\"/> As of 2018, it is called Renesas V850&nbsp;Family and RH850&nbsp;Family with V850/V850E1/V850E2 and V850E2/V850E3 CPU cores, respectively. Those CPU cores have extended [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] of original V810 CPU core;<ref name=\"V810-GCC\"/> running with V850 compiler.<ref name=\"GHS-V850\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|sw-emulator|ISS|MEME}}Emulator (CPU Simulator) Software ==\n\n=== MAME ===\n\nBecause the V60/V70 had been used for many Japanese [[game arcade]]s, their [[instruction set architecture]] has still survived as [[Emulator#CPU simulator|CPU simulator]] for this niche market.

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

According to one Sega staff member, when Nakayama first received design specifications for the PlayStation, he was \u2018the maddest I have ever seen him\u2019, calling up the entire R&D division to his office to shout at them. An effort was made to compensate by adding another CPU for dual operation; however, this solution made the system so hard to develop for that, according to Yu Suzuki himself, \u201conly 1 out of 100 programmers could use the Saturn to its full potential.\u201d\"}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, NEC ----->\n\n<ref name=\"ps98-145-hmw\">\n{{Cite web|url=http://121ware.com/support/product/data/spec/sft/sw225d-1.html |title=Model Number: PS98-145-HMW, Item Name: PC-UX/V(Rel2.0)(V60) |publisher=NEC product sheet}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, GHS ----->\n\n<ref name=\"GHS-V850\">\n{{cite web|title=V850 and RH850 Embedded Software Solutions|url=https://www.ghs.com/products/v850_development.html|website=www.ghs.com|publisher=Green Hills Software}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, MIPS ----->\n\n<ref name=\"HIREC-HR5000\">\n{{cite web|last1=Voica|first1=Alex|title=Back to the future: 64-bit MIPS CPU explores the origins of the solar system \u2013 MIPS|url=https://www.mips.com/blog/back-to-the-future-64-bit-mips-cpu-explores-rare-asteroid/|website=www.mips.com|publisher=MIPS|language=en|date=2015-07-29}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MIPS64-5Kf-DS\">\n{{cite book|title=MIPS64 5Kf Processor Core Datasheet|date=2005-01-31|publisher=MIPS Technologies Inc.|edition=01.04|url=http://wiki.prplfoundation.org/w/images/f/f1/MD00111-2B-4KEC-DTS-02.03.pdf|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, MAME DEV ----->\n\n<ref name=\"v60-cemu\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c.html |title=MAME:/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222070653/http://mamedev.org/source/src/emu/cpu/v60/v60.c.html |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev1\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403190647/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/segas32.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-model1\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/model1.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/model1.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403180645/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/model1.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-ssv\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403215238/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ssv.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"mamedev-mc32\">\n{{cite web|url=http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c.html |title=MAME:/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c |publisher=Mamedev.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403182226/http://mamedev.org/source/src/mame/drivers/ms32.c.html |archivedate=2014-04-03}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, PLANET VIRTUAL BOY ----->\n\n<ref name=\"V810-GCC\">\n{{cite web|title=A newer GCC compiler. \u00ab Virtual Boy Development Board \u00ab Forum \u00ab Planet Virtual Boy|url=http://www.planetvb.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=6456|website=www.planetvb.com|language=en}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, DATAQUEST ----->\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1986\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 1st Quarter 1986, p. 18 (pdf p. 44 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1987\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 1st Quarter 1987, p. 18 (pdf p. 182 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dataquest-1987-2\">\n[[Dataquest]], \"Japanese Semiconductor Industry Service\", 2nd Quarter 1987, p. 21 (pdf p. 223 in [http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/04/102723432-05-01-acc.pdf this multi-volume archive])</ref>\n\n<!----- WEB, COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW ----->\n\n<ref name=\"CBR-1\">\nNEC LAUNCHES V80 ANSWER TO INTEL's 80486 -

Additionally, all uniforms are treated with the chemical [[permethrin]] to help protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases like malaria. Some U.S. Army soldiers during the latter stages of the [[Iraq War]] also wore the OEF patterned ACU; some were seen wearing them as late as December 2011, when the United States withdrew its military forces from the country at the end of the war.{{Cn|date=August 2019}} The MultiCam-patterned ACUs were retired in 2019 with the UCP-patterned ones.\n\n===Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP)===\n{{Main article|Operational Camouflage Pattern}}\nIn May 2014, the Army unofficially announced that the [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]] (OCP) would replace UCP on the ACU. The original \"Scorpion\" pattern was developed at [[United States Army Soldier Systems Center]] by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan in 2010 as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named \"Scorpion W2\", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the actual pattern is \"not that relevant.\" The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements.<ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140523/NEWS04/305230076/Army-selects-new-camo-pattern Army selects new camo pattern] - Armytimes.com, 23 May 2014</ref> On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015.

Originally only pin-on skill badges were authorized for wear on the ACU, with no more than 5 at any one time.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, regulations were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges. The 5-badge limit remained in effect, and there could be no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the branch tape, name tapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference.<ref>[http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/Uniform/docs/Army%20Combat%20Uniform%20(ACU)%20Ensemble.pdf Army Combat Uniform Ensemble], paragraph 5L.</ref> Skill tabs, such as the [[President's Hundred Tab]], [[Special Forces Tab|Special Forces]], [[Ranger Tab|Ranger]], and [[Sapper Tab|Sapper]] are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a 3-tab-only rule.<ref name=\"Ensemble\">Paragraph 5S.</ref> A tab that is an integral part of a unit patch, such as the \"Mountain\" or \"Airborne\" tab, is not counted against the rule.

Permanent IR [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]] squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when [[night vision device]]s are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in [[garrison]] or when not in use.\n\nThree U.S. flag insignia are authorized for wear with the ACU: full-color, full-color infrared, and subdued infrared. The U.S. flag insignia is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions in the Army, while the Air Force only authorizes the subdued flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/uniform/docs/ALARACT%20Message%20164%206%20Sep%2006.pdf|title=ALARACT 164/2006|publisher=}}</ref> Subdued [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder sleeve insignia]] are worn.\n\nThe jacket's [[Mandarin collar]] was intended to be worn up in combat to fit with the [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest]] (IOTV) body armor, and worn in the down position otherwise. With the change of pattern to OCP, the Velcro tab that closed the Mandarin collar was removed, along with other Velcro closures.<ref name=\"Summary\">[https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/396739.pdf Army Combat Uniform Summary of Changes] Accessed 14 May 2017</ref>\n\nThe front closure is zippered and reinforced with Velcro, designed for use with OTV. The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility. The jacket is worn so that its bottom is between the bottom of the pocket and the top of the cargo pocket.\n\nIn the field, the jacket may be replaced by the flame resistant [[Army Combat Shirt]] when worn directly under the IOTV.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/05/04/2995-peo-soldier-to-unveil-new-army-combat-shirt/|title=PEO Soldier to Unveil New Army Combat Shirt|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Trousers===\nThe ACU trousers (or ACU pants) are worn with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature Velcro pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and Velcro for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets one on each pant leg with a Velcro closure. ACU trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece Velcro (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field.\n\nThe belt loops are of new design. The width has doubled, and there are now 8 of them compared to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs at the bottom of the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.<ref name=\"Summary\"/>\n\nTo be able to differentiate the FRACU{{clarify|date=February 2020}} from ACU at a distance, a small square inch tan patch is affixed to the left sleeve cuff on the jacket and the middle of the left cargo pocket flap on the trousers.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Soldier iraq.jpg|thumb|276px|A U.S. Army soldier in March 2007 wears a helmet with a UCP camouflage cover during the [[Iraq War]]]]\nTypically, the ACU is worn with the [[Advanced Combat Helmet]], a [[patrol cap]], or a [[boonie hat]] and/or fleece cap as appropriate in winter months.

The original \"Scorpion\" pattern was developed at [[United States Army Soldier Systems Center]] by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan in 2010 as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named \"Scorpion W2\", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the actual pattern is \"not that relevant.\" The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements.<ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140523/NEWS04/305230076/Army-selects-new-camo-pattern Army selects new camo pattern] - Armytimes.com, 23 May 2014</ref> On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015.

Originally only pin-on skill badges were authorized for wear on the ACU, with no more than 5 at any one time.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, regulations were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges. The 5-badge limit remained in effect, and there could be no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the branch tape, name tapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference.<ref>[http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/Uniform/docs/Army%20Combat%20Uniform%20(ACU)%20Ensemble.pdf Army Combat Uniform Ensemble], paragraph 5L.</ref> Skill tabs, such as the [[President's Hundred Tab]], [[Special Forces Tab|Special Forces]], [[Ranger Tab|Ranger]], and [[Sapper Tab|Sapper]] are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a 3-tab-only rule.<ref name=\"Ensemble\">Paragraph 5S.</ref> A tab that is an integral part of a unit patch, such as the \"Mountain\" or \"Airborne\" tab, is not counted against the rule.

Permanent IR [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]] squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when [[night vision device]]s are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in [[garrison]] or when not in use.\n\nThree U.S. flag insignia are authorized for wear with the ACU: full-color, full-color infrared, and subdued infrared. The U.S. flag insignia is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions in the Army, while the Air Force only authorizes the subdued flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/uniform/docs/ALARACT%20Message%20164%206%20Sep%2006.pdf|title=ALARACT 164/2006|publisher=}}</ref> Subdued [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder sleeve insignia]] are worn.\n\nThe jacket's [[Mandarin collar]] was intended to be worn up in combat to fit with the [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest]] (IOTV) body armor, and worn in the down position otherwise.

The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility. The jacket is worn so that its bottom is between the bottom of the pocket and the top of the cargo pocket.\n\nIn the field, the jacket may be replaced by the flame resistant [[Army Combat Shirt]] when worn directly under the IOTV.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/05/04/2995-peo-soldier-to-unveil-new-army-combat-shirt/|title=PEO Soldier to Unveil New Army Combat Shirt|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Trousers===\nThe ACU trousers (or ACU pants) are worn with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature Velcro pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and Velcro for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets one on each pant leg with a Velcro closure. ACU trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece Velcro (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field.\n\nThe belt loops are of new design. The width has doubled, and there are now 8 of them compared to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs at the bottom of the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.<ref name=\"Summary\"/>\n\nTo be able to differentiate the FRACU{{clarify|date=February 2020}} from ACU at a distance, a small square inch tan patch is affixed to the left sleeve cuff on the jacket and the middle of the left cargo pocket flap on the trousers.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Soldier iraq.jpg|thumb|276px|A U.S. Army soldier in March 2007 wears a helmet with a UCP camouflage cover during the [[Iraq War]]]]\nTypically, the ACU is worn with the [[Advanced Combat Helmet]], a [[patrol cap]], or a [[boonie hat]] and/or fleece cap as appropriate in winter months.
