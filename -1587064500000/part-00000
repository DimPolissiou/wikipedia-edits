After demanding they hand over a bag of cash, which it appears they were reluctant to do, the man shot both of them fatally. Empty handed, the murderer then made his escape from the building, through an exit and down a fire escape, as other members of the cinema staff came to the men's aid.\n\n==Investigation==\n[[Liverpool City Police]] launched a huge manhunt for the killer, which turned up few leads until some months later when they received a letter from a pair of convicted criminals, a [[prostitute]] and her [[pimp]]. Jacqueline Dickson and James Northam were prepared to assist the police with information on the murders in return for immunity from prosecution themselves. This resulted in the arrests of two Liverpool men, '''Charles Connolly''', 26 and '''George Kelly''', 27. Kelly had convictions for petty theft whilst Connolly had been in trouble for brawling. Despite their protestations that they had never met before and both being able to produce sound alibis for the evening of 19 March, the pair were charged with the murder of the two men in the cinema.\n\n==First trial==\nThey stood trial at Liverpool [[Assizes (England and Wales)|Assizes]] in the city's [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St Georges Hall]] on 12 January 1950 before Mr. Justice Roland Oliver. The prosecution's case was that Kelly had been the gunman and that Connolly had acted as lookout as well as having planned the robbery.\n\n===Northam's evidence===\nIn his evidence, Northam alleged that he and Dickson had been present in the Bee Hive public house in Mount Pleasant with the defendants when they were plotting the crime; had seen Kelly loading a pistol; and that Kelly had borrowed his (Northam's) overcoat for use as a disguise during the robbery. Dickson stated that Kelly had borrowed a dark scarf or apron to use as a mask; trying it on in front of the customers of the crowded pub before he and Connolly boarded a tram to take them to the Edge Hill area. No other witnesses to this action were ever found. Northam claimed he had originally planned to assist in the robbery but the sight of the gun had frightened him off.\n\n===Graham's evidence===\nMuch was made of the evidence of Robert Graham, a [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] criminal serving a sentence in [[Liverpool (HM Prison)|Walton Prison]] at the same time that Kelly and Connolly were on remand there, who claimed to have carried messages between the prisoners as they sat in adjacent cells, which would have been unnecessary as the cells, which had barred doors rather than solid ones,  were near enough that the men could converse freely. He also alleged that both Kelly and Connolly had separately confessed their part in the murders to him in the exercise yard, which both men denied. Graham was later rewarded for his evidence with a reduction in his sentence. \n                     \nKelly had spent almost the whole day and early evening of the murder drinking heavily and many witnesses came forward to confirm the fact that he was clearly half drunk as the day wore on. The cinema staff however, were quite certain the man who threatened them outside the manager's office before sprinting out of the building and away up a side street, so quickly they could not keep up with him, was not somebody who had been drinking. Forensic examination of the crime scene and the angle of the bullet wounds in the victims' bodies indicated that the person who fired the shots had held the gun in his left hand. The cinema fireman, who witnessed the gunman leaving through the fire exit, noted that he kept his left hand, presumably holding his gun, in his pocket. Kelly was right-handed.\n\nAfter what was then one of the longest murder trials in British legal history, the jury failed to reach a verdict and a retrial was ordered, this time with the defendants tried separately.\n\n===Where was Charles Connolly ===\nMuch was made of the question of where Charles Connolly had been at the time of the shooting <ref name=\":0\">{{cite website|title=Unsolved Murders - Bernard Catterall|url=http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=6707#browse|work=Unsolved Murders|date=16 April 2020}}</ref> <ref name=\":1\">{{cite website|title=Unsolved Murders - Leonard Thomas|url=http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=2221#browse|work=Unsolved Murders|date=16 April 2020}}</ref> as it was said that his role was that of lookout. However, he was not seen near the cinema and the sequence of events tended to preclude him having played any role as look out as he neither warned George Kelly of John Catterall's arrival at the managers office nor appeared to have been standing ready at the emergency exit which the gunman clearly had trouble opening. This led to the question of how the gunman entered the cinema, the conclusion being that he must have either gone through the auditorium of from the main entrance, or that there had been an accomplice who had opened the emergency exit from the inside in advance.\n\n===The mystery of the cut telephone wires ===\nThe telephone wires at the Cameo Cinema had been cut at the foot of the spiral staircase <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" /> and the police were called by a local resident although they arrived quickly. However, no explanation was put forward for who cut them and when. The issue of the cut wires is further complicated when considering the evidence of Northam, Dickson and Graham, none of whom detailed the issue in the planning. In particular, if the robbery had been planned in the Beehive Hotel earlier in the evening then it might have been reasonable to consider that the conversation would have addressed the need or intention to cut the phone wires and whether anyone had a tool that they could be cut with. Nor is the cutting of the telephone wires detailed in Northam's subsequent conversation in the following days with george Kelly when he allegedly explained what happened. The ommission of this fact that only the murderer would have known and which was either not reported in the newspapers or only reported in the most extensive coverage, being a significant part of the robbery that would have taken time, of which there were only a few minutes from start to finish, undermines the veracity of Northam, Dickson and Graham's subseqent accounts of George Kellys alleged confessions.\n\n===2 February 1949 Cameo Cinema break in ===\nLittle is made of the break in at the Cameo Cinema on 2 February 1949 <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" /> for which three youths were arrested and charged on 2 April 1949. During the break in they had gone into the manager's office, where Leonard Thomas and John Catterall were later shot and tried forcing cupboards. They took cigarettes, chocolate and 10s, worth in total about \u00a35, but would no doubt have familiarised themselves with the office layout and seen the safe. Whilst there is nothing connecting them with the murder, where was nothing connecting  Charles Connolly or George Kelly with the murder either other than false statements and circumstantial behaviour. The significance of the 2 February 1949 break in was that it suggests that the Cameo Cinema was a target with local youths and criminals for easy pickings and that there could have been any number of other people with an interest in the venue with regards to robbing it after word spread about the lay out and discussion was had about how they handled their money.   \n\n==Re-trial==\nKelly was tried first and, despite a spirited defence by [[Rose Heilbron]] [[King's Counsel|KC]], he was found guilty and sentenced to death. The just was [[James Cassels (politician)|Justice Cassels]]. Connolly was then offered the chance to plead guilty to conspiracy and being an accessory. Faced with the almost certainty that he would otherwise be convicted of murder and share the fate of his co-accused if he refused, he had little choice other than to accept the offer and plead accordingly. Contrary to popular belief, Connolly did not [[turn state's evidence|turn King's Evidence]] but simply pleaded guilty to the charges laid before him. His  plea however, destroyed Kelly's assertions of his own innocence and despite an appeal against his conviction, Kelly was executed at [[Liverpool (HM Prison)|Walton Prison]], [[Liverpool]] by [[Albert Pierrepoint]] and his assistant [[Harry Allen (executioner)|Harry Allen]] on 28 March 1950. He continued to assert his innocence, even on the scaffold. Connolly was released from prison in 1957 and died in 1997. Shortly before his death, he took part in an interview on [[BBC Radio Merseyside]], during which he reaffirmed both his and Kelly's innocence.\n\n===[[James Cassels (politician)|Justice Cassels]]===\n[[James Cassels (politician)|Justice Cassels]] was the judge at the second trial. After the convictions were handed down he commended Northam and Dickson and awarded them \u00a330 each for their selfless role in the case and recommended that Graham be similarly have a good word given although he could not reward him directly under his powers <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />. [[James Cassels (politician)|Justice Cassels]] said 'but for their evidence, George Kelly and Charles Connolly, two dangerous criminals might never had been brought to justice. Whatever their previous faults might have been, they, by their actions in the case, and at the risk to their personal safety, had rendered a service to the community'. Dickson, who was already a convicted prostitute, went on two years later to be convicted for violently robbing her clients and was sentenced to a number of years imprisonment. Northam had a large number of convcitions.\n\n==Controversy==\nThe case caused considerable disquiet in legal circles for many years and there were a number of attempts to have it re-opened. The evidence put forward by the prosecution had emanated from witnesses who could hardly be described as being of sterling character. Dickson was a convicted prostitute and thief who, two years after the Cameo trial, was sentenced  with others to a lengthy prison term for the violent robberies of a number of her clients. Northam had been a criminal since the age of 14 and had spent much of the 1940s in and out of prison. Graham shared a similar background. All three stood to gain by their testimony. The detective who led the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Herbert Balmer, had difficulty in corroborating much of the prosecution evidence during the trial and many prosecution witness statements bore the sign of police coaching. Employer's timesheets, which detailed Connolly's movements on the day of the murder, had been amateurishly tampered with. Witness statements that favoured the accused men were held back by the police, a fact later discovered by a local businessman, Luigi Santangeli, who set out to investigate the crime on behalf of Connolly in the 1990s and was given access to the case files by [[Merseyside Police]].\n\n===Donald Johnson===\nMost importantly, scant attention was paid to the fact that another Liverpool criminal, Donald Johnson, had demonstrated an intimate knowledge of the crime after being arrested for a street robbery in [[Birkenhead]] and had been charged with complicity in the murders prior to the arrests of Kelly and Connolly. Johnson had been transferred to Walton Prison from Birkenhead, where he allegedly admitted to another prisoner that he had been involved in the cinema shootings. This other prisoner was Robert Graham, the same witness who would later tell the court that Connolly and Kelly had confessed to being the murderers. During questioning, Johnson admitted being in the vicinity of the cinema at the time of the murders and had been stopped by a police constable, suspicious of his loitering, who had demanded to see his identity card and then taken his name. Johnson, during police interrogation, referred to the murder weapon as being an automatic, a fact which the police had not made known to the public. He further stated that one of the dead men had been shot whilst on his hands and knees, another fact which had been held back by the police. Johnson also told police that he knew the identity of the gunman, but had taken a religious oath not to reveal his name.\n\nBecause Johnson's  entire statement was ruled inadmissible, after the presiding judge decided that the police had obtained it by threats and inducement, an attempt to try him as an accessory failed and he was freed. Liverpool City Police were then left in the position of having lost their most likely suspect - who could not be even questioned about the case again. Given the magnitude of the crime, reputations and careers would no doubt have been in jeopardy and the investigation team were in desperate need of fresh suspects. Donald Johnson later claimed that he had lied about what he knew of the shooting in the hope that he could get the police to dismiss his Birkenhead offence. Confessing to even peripheral involvement in a brutal double murder however, simply to have a mere mugging charge dismissed, would seem an unlikely course of action for an experienced criminal like Johnson to take and he clearly had a detailed knowledge of what had occurred in the cinema office. There has been speculation in the years since that a close relative of Johnson's may have been the gunman and that was the reason he refused to name him to the police. Johnson died in 1988.                         \nEventually the case reached the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] in February 2001 and in June 2003 Kelly's and Connolly's convictions were judged to be unsafe and were duly quashed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Siddle|first1=John|title=ECHO Murder Files: The double murders which rocked post-war Liverpool|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/echo-murder-files-double-murders-9269795|work=liverpoolecho|date=16 May 2015}}</ref> Kelly's remains were taken from their burial place in Walton prison by his family and he was given a dignified funeral after a service in [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shennan|first1=Paddy|title=Cameo Cinema murders - Wallasey author working on screenplay for film wants Hollywood star Stephen Graham in lead role|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/cameo-cinema-murders-wallasey-author-9797586|work=liverpoolecho|date=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Related case==\nTwo years after the execution, Chief Superintendent Balmer was investigating the murder of Beatrice Rimmer in Cranborne Road, just a few hundred yards from the Cameo cinema. He was again claiming that two young men, this time from Manchester, Alfred Burns and Edward Devlin, were responsible for the crime. Their convictions were clearly shown to be unsafe in a book, Murderers Or Martyrs (Waterside Press 2013), again by George Skelly, with a damning foreword by former UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith QC. Indeed, the author demonstrated in detail how Balmer may have framed the two men in an identical scenario to that used by him to frame Kelly and Connolly two years earlier. The possibility that Balmer did frame the two men is more tenuous than in the Cameo case and probably explains why Skelly's submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, involving new argument and eleven bundles of previously undisclosed evidence, was rejected.\n<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shennan|first1=Paddy|title=Liverpool murders investigated by author George Skelly|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-murders-investigated-author-george-3323765|work=liverpoolecho|date=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Cameo Murders]]'' (book)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20060623073925/http://www.innocent.org.uk/cases/georgekelly/index.html\n*https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/stevenhortonuk/cameomurders.html&date=2009-10-25+22:22:53\n*http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=2221#browse\n*http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=6707#browse\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cameo Murder}}\n[[Category:1949 murders in Europe]]\n[[Category:1949 crimes in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1949 in England]]\n[[Category:1940s in Liverpool]]\n[[Category:History of Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Murder in Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1940s murders in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2011}}\n{{notability|date=April 2011}}\n}}\n{{Infobox court case\n|name               = \n|court              = Liverpool Assizes\n|image              = \n|imagesize          = \n|imagelink          = \n|imagealt           = \n|caption            = \n|full name          = \n|date decided       = {{start date|1950|02|08|df=}}\n|citations          = \n|ECLI               = \n|transcripts        = \n|judges             = Mr Justice Roland Oliver\n|number of judges   = \n|decision by        = \n|concurring         = \n|dissenting         = \n|concur/dissent     = \n|prior actions      = \n|appealed from      = \n|appealed to        = [[Court of Criminal Appeal]]\n|subsequent actions = \n|related actions    = \n|opinions           = \n|keywords           = <!-- {{hlist | }} -->\n|italic title       = \n}}\nOn the evening of 19 March 1949,  the ''Cameo'' cinema in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], was the scene of a brutal double murder which led to a miscarriage of justice and the longest trial in British history at the time.<ref>George Skelly, ''The Cameo Conspiracy: A Shocking True Story of Murder and Injustice'', Waterside Press, p.11</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Call for Cameo murders inquiry|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7966136.stm|date=26 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nThe cinema manager, Leonard Thomas, was counting the day's takings assisted by his deputy, Bernard Catterall, when a masked man entered their office armed with a pistol.

There has been speculation in the years since that a close relative of Johnson's may have been the gunman and that was the reason he refused to name him to the police. Johnson died in 1988.                         \nEventually the case reached the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] in February 2001 and in June 2003 Kelly's and Connolly's convictions were judged to be unsafe and were duly quashed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Siddle|first1=John|title=ECHO Murder Files: The double murders which rocked post-war Liverpool|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/echo-murder-files-double-murders-9269795|work=liverpoolecho|date=16 May 2015}}</ref> Kelly's remains were taken from their burial place in Walton prison by his family and he was given a dignified funeral after a service in [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shennan|first1=Paddy|title=Cameo Cinema murders - Wallasey author working on screenplay for film wants Hollywood star Stephen Graham in lead role|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/cameo-cinema-murders-wallasey-author-9797586|work=liverpoolecho|date=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Related case==\nTwo years after the execution, Chief Superintendent Balmer was investigating the murder of Beatrice Rimmer in Cranborne Road, just a few hundred yards from the Cameo cinema. He was again claiming that two young men, this time from Manchester, Alfred Burns and Edward Devlin, were responsible for the crime. Their convictions were clearly shown to be unsafe in a book, Murderers Or Martyrs (Waterside Press 2013), again by George Skelly, with a damning foreword by former UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith QC. Indeed, the author demonstrated in detail how Balmer may have framed the two men in an identical scenario to that used by him to frame Kelly and Connolly two years earlier. The possibility that Balmer did frame the two men is more tenuous than in the Cameo case and probably explains why Skelly's submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, involving new argument and eleven bundles of previously undisclosed evidence, was rejected.\n<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shennan|first1=Paddy|title=Liverpool murders investigated by author George Skelly|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-murders-investigated-author-george-3323765|work=liverpoolecho|date=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Cameo Murders]]'' (book)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20060623073925/http://www.innocent.org.uk/cases/georgekelly/index.html\n*https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/stevenhortonuk/cameomurders.html&date=2009-10-25+22:22:53\n*http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=2221#browse\n*http://www.unsolved-murders.co.uk/murder-content.php?key=6707#browse\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cameo Murder}}\n[[Category:1949 murders in Europe]]\n[[Category:1949 crimes in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1949 in England]]\n[[Category:1940s in Liverpool]]\n[[Category:History of Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Murder in Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1940s murders in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Helpmechoose837", "label": "safe", "comment": "one typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_murder"}

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.

Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. [[Hinduism]] has [[Hinduism and LGBT topics|traditionally portrayed homosexuality]] as natural and joyful, though some texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests (who are also nominally required to refrain from sex altogether).\n\nHinduism also acknowledges a third gender and has a strong tradition of portraying them positively; there are multiple characters in the [[Mahabharata]] who change genders, such as [[Shikhandi]], who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. [[Bahuchara Mata]] is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by ''hijras'' as their patroness.\n\nThe [[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]] and the [[Sushruta Samhita]], two important [[Hindu texts|scriptures from ancient India]] relating to [[dharma]] and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be unchangeable and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti lists fourteen types of ''panda'' (men who are impotent with women); among these are the ''mukhebhaga'' (men who have oral sex with other men), the ''sevyaka'' (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the ''irshyaka'' (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The [[Kama Sutra]], a [[Sanskrit]] text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term ''tritiya-prakriti'' to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (''svairini'', who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as ''kami'' or ''paksha''), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Samhita and the [[Charaka Samhita]] delve further into the issue of homosexuality, stating that homosexuals are conceived when the father's semen is scanty and transgender people are conceived when the father and mother reverse roles during intercourse (''purushayita'', \"woman on top\").<ref>[https://www.galva108.org/single-post/2014/05/15/Homosexuality-Hinduism-the-Third-Gender-A-Summary Homosexuality, Hinduism & the Third Gender (A Summary)]</ref><ref>[https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-faith-column/2009/04/gay-homosexuality-vaishnavism Vaishnavism and homosexuality]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire]], a number of the preexisting [[Delhi Sultanate]] laws were combined into the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], mandating a common set of punishments for [[zina]] (unlawful intercourse).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kugle|first1=Scott A|title=Sufis and Saints' Bodies: Mysticism, Corporeality, and Sacred Power in Islam|date=1 Sep 2011|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|location=Chapter 4 - Note 62-63|isbn=9780807872772|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJ1vpC_SeLcC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309|accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref> These could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/digestmoohummud00bailgoog#page/n57/mode/2up A digest of the Moohummudan law] pp. 1-3 with footnotes, Neil Baillie, Smith Elder, London</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42157/how-did-the-mughals-view-homosexuality|title=How did the Mughals view homosexuality?|website=History Stack Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/810007/from-bulleh-shah-and-shah-hussain-to-amir-khusro-same-sex-references-abound-in-islamic-sufi-poetry|title=From Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain to Amir Khusro, same-sex references abound in Islamic poetry|work=Scroll.in|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=7 September 2018|last=Khalid|first=Haroon|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.diarna.org/site/detail/public/1931/|title=Sarmad Kashani Tomb in Jami Masjid, New Delhi, India - Archive - Diarna.org|website=archive.diarna.org}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=b7-bAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32|title=Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Sarman|author=V.
