She is one of five children of brick-kiln labourers in a rural village in southern Tamil Nadu state; she overcame malnutrition as a child to become a middle-distance runner.

While they were gone, Soundarajan, the oldest, was in charge of taking care of her four siblings. Sometimes, Soundarajan's grandfather, an accomplished runner, helped while her parents were away. When she was 13, he taught her to run on an open stretch of dirt outside the hut and bought her a pair of shoes.\n\nAt her first competition, in eighth grade, Soundarajan won a tin cup trophy; she collected 13 more in interschool competitions. The sports coach at a nearby high school took note of her performances and recruited her. The school paid her tuition and provided her with a uniform and hot lunches. It was the first time Soundarajan had ever eaten three meals a day.\n\nAfter high school, Soundarajan got a scholarship from an Arts college in Pudukkottai, the nearest town. and the following year, Soundarajan transferred to a college in [[Chennai]], the state's capital, which was seven hours away. In 2005, she attended the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea, where she won a silver medal. In 2006, she was chosen to represent India at the Asian Games (run by the Olympic Council of Asia). In the 800 meters, Soundarajan took the silver in 2 minutes, 3.16 seconds, beating [[Viktoriya Yalovtseva]] of Kazakhstan by 0.03 seconds.  This win led to Soundarajan becoming embroiled in an ongoing, unresolved debate over what makes an athlete eligible to compete in the women's division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/8192977/failed-gender-test-forces-olympian-redefine-athletic-career-espn-magazine |title=Failed gender test forces Olympian to redefine athletic career \u2013 ESPN The Magazine |website=Espn.go.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Soundarajan was awarded 1 lakh cash from then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[Jayalalithaa]]<ref>{{cite web|author=5 Dec 2016 |url=https://twitter.com/SanthiSoundrajn/status/806008047134879744 |title=Gopi Shankar Madurai on Twitter: \"Cannot believe she is no more #RipAmma #Jayalalitha is a legacy \" |website=[[Twitter]] |date=2016-12-05 |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nSoundarajan holds the national record for the women's [[3000 metres steeplechase]] clocking 10:44.65 seconds.

Soundarajan grew up in a 20-by-5 foot hut across the road from the new home she lives in now. There was no bathroom or outhouse, nor was there running water or electricity. She is one of five children of brick-kiln labourers in a rural village in southern Tamil Nadu state; she overcame malnutrition as a child to become a middle-distance runner. Her family could not even afford a television and watched Soundarajan's Doha race at a neighbour's house.<ref name=\"zeenews.india.com\">{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/others/santhi-scandal-an-insult-to-all-tamils_343116.html |title=Santhi scandal an insult to all Tamils &#124; Zee News |website=Zeenews.india.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref> Her mother and father had to go to another town to work in a brickyard, where they earned the American equivalent of $4 a week. While they were gone, Soundarajan, the oldest, was in charge of taking care of her four siblings. Sometimes, Soundarajan's grandfather, an accomplished runner, helped while her parents were away. When she was 13, he taught her to run on an open stretch of dirt outside the hut and bought her a pair of shoes.\n\nAt her first competition, in eighth grade, Soundarajan won a tin cup trophy; she collected 13 more in interschool competitions. The sports coach at a nearby high school took note of her performances and recruited her. The school paid her tuition and provided her with a uniform and hot lunches. It was the first time Soundarajan had ever eaten three meals a day.\n\nAfter high school, Soundarajan got a scholarship from an Arts college in Pudukkottai, the nearest town. and the following year, Soundarajan transferred to a college in [[Chennai]], the state's capital, which was seven hours away. In 2005, she attended the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea, where she won a silver medal. In 2006, she was chosen to represent India at the Asian Games (run by the Olympic Council of Asia). In the 800 meters, Soundarajan took the silver in 2 minutes, 3.16 seconds, beating [[Viktoriya Yalovtseva]] of Kazakhstan by 0.03 seconds.  This win led to Soundarajan becoming embroiled in an ongoing, unresolved debate over what makes an athlete eligible to compete in the women's division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/8192977/failed-gender-test-forces-olympian-redefine-athletic-career-espn-magazine |title=Failed gender test forces Olympian to redefine athletic career \u2013 ESPN The Magazine |website=Espn.go.com |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Soundarajan was awarded 1 lakh cash from then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[Jayalalithaa]]<ref>{{cite web|author=5 Dec 2016 |url=https://twitter.com/SanthiSoundrajn/status/806008047134879744 |title=Gopi Shankar Madurai on Twitter: \"Cannot believe she is no more #RipAmma #Jayalalitha is a legacy \" |website=[[Twitter]] |date=2016-12-05 |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nSoundarajan holds the national record for the women's [[3000 metres steeplechase]] clocking 10:44.65 seconds.

Soundarajan supported Semenya, fearing that Semenya would face the same humiliation that she did.<ref name=\"edition.cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/09/14/Semenya.India.Athlete/ | work=CNN | title=India athlete makes plea for Semenya | date=14 September 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1919562,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=1 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/2009/09/2009919193436727487.html |title=al jazeera |website=Aljazeera.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\nSoundarajan also extended her support to [[Dutee Chand]] and said the youngster should not be victimized. She also expressed her dismay at the lack of sensitivity in the handling of the Dutee Chand issue, fearing that the young athlete's future may have now been jeopardized. Soundarajan demanded that all steps be taken to ensure the 18-year-old's return to the track.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gopalkrishnan |first=Krithika |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/Santhi-Urges-Establishment-to-Help-Sidelined-Dutee/2014/07/19/article2335981.ece |title=Santhi Urges Establishment to Help Sidelined Dutee |newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=2014-07-19 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\nWelcoming the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]'s ruling in favour of Chand on 27 July 2015 for suspending gender test, the landmark ruling has also fuelled Soundarajan's hopes of regaining the silver medal and the Rs 10-lakh prize money from the central government which was withheld after the gender test row.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/Santhi-keen-on-getting-her-Asiad-medal-back/articleshow/48262924.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Santhi keen on getting her Asiad medal back \u2013 The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Ruling-on-Dutee-Gives-Santhi-a-Ray-of-Hope/2015/08/10/article2966755.ece | title=Ruling on Dutee gives Santhi a Ray of hope | work=The New Indian Express | date=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn this regard, it is notable that the IAAF policy, suspended as a result of Chand's case, did not prevent Soundarajan from competing.

The series, created by [[Richard and Esther Shapiro]] and produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], revolves around the [[Carrington family|Carringtons]], a wealthy family residing in [[Denver, Colorado]]. ''Dynasty'' stars [[John Forsythe]] as oil magnate [[Blake Carrington]], [[Linda Evans]] as his new wife [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]], and later [[Joan Collins]] as his former wife [[Alexis Colby|Alexis]].\n\n''Dynasty'' was conceived by ABC to compete with [[CBS]]'s prime time series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. Ratings for the show's first season were unimpressive, but a revamp for the second season that included the arrival of Collins as scheming Alexis saw ratings enter the top 20. By the fall of 1982, it was a top 10 show, and by the spring of 1985, it was the #1 show in the United States. The series declined considerably in popularity during its final two seasons, and it was ultimately cancelled in the spring of 1989 after nine seasons and 220 episodes. A two-part [[miniseries]], ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]'', aired in October 1991. A [[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|reboot series]] with a new cast premiered on [[The CW]] in October 2017.\n\n''Dynasty'' was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama|Best TV Drama Series]] every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1983. The series spawned a successful line of fashion and luxury products, and also a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series called ''[[The Colbys]]''. Other notable cast members included [[Pamela Sue Martin]], [[Lloyd Bochner]], [[Heather Locklear]], [[Catherine Oxenberg]], [[Michael Nader]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Emma Samms]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Kate O'Mara]] and [[Stephanie Beacham]].\n\n==Series history==\n{{Further|List of Dynasty (1981 TV series) characters}}\n\n===Development===\nAaron Spelling, already well known for his successful ABC series, including ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[Vega$]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]'',<ref name=\"SMH 2005-09\">{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-great-escape/2005/09/17/1126750167460.html |title=The Great Escape|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=September 19, 2005|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=SMH.com.au|accessdate=February 25, 2009}}</ref> took on Richard and Esther Shapiro's vision of a rich and powerful family who \"lived and sinned\" in a 48-room Denver mansion.<ref name=\"SOE\">{{Cite book |last=Schemering |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Schemering |title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Schemering book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]] |date=September 1985 |pages=80\u201381 |isbn=0-345-32459-5}}</ref> Esther Shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was ''[[I, Claudius]]'', a fictionalized depiction of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] of [[Roman emperor]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-good-the-bad-and-the-wildly-bitchy-2192378.html |title=The good, the bad and the wildly bitchy |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent.co.uk|first=Fiona |last=Sturges |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Shapiro said in 1985, \"We wanted to do something that would be fun, an American fantasy.

The series, created by [[Richard and Esther Shapiro]] and produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], revolves around the [[Carrington family|Carringtons]], a wealthy family residing in [[Denver, Colorado]]. ''Dynasty'' stars [[John Forsythe]] as oil magnate [[Blake Carrington]], [[Linda Evans]] as his new wife [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]], and later [[Joan Collins]] as his former wife [[Alexis Colby|Alexis]].\n\n''Dynasty'' was conceived by ABC to compete with [[CBS]]'s prime time series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. Ratings for the show's first season were unimpressive, but a revamp for the second season that included the arrival of Collins as scheming Alexis saw ratings enter the top 20. By the fall of 1982, it was a top 10 show, and by the spring of 1985, it was the #1 show in the United States. The series declined considerably in popularity during its final two seasons, and it was ultimately cancelled in the spring of 1989 after nine seasons and 220 episodes. A two-part [[miniseries]], ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]'', aired in October 1991. A [[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|reboot series]] with a new cast premiered on [[The CW]] in October 2017.\n\n''Dynasty'' was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama|Best TV Drama Series]] every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1983. The series spawned a successful line of fashion and luxury products, and also a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series called ''[[The Colbys]]''. Other notable cast members included [[Pamela Sue Martin]], [[Lloyd Bochner]], [[Heather Locklear]], [[Catherine Oxenberg]], [[Michael Nader]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Emma Samms]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Kate O'Mara]] and [[Stephanie Beacham]].\n\n==Series history==\n{{Further|List of Dynasty (1981 TV series) characters}}\n\n===Development===\nAaron Spelling, already well known for his successful ABC series, including ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[Vega$]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]'',<ref name=\"SMH 2005-09\">{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-great-escape/2005/09/17/1126750167460.html |title=The Great Escape|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=September 19, 2005|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=SMH.com.au|accessdate=February 25, 2009}}</ref> took on Richard and Esther Shapiro's vision of a rich and powerful family who \"lived and sinned\" in a 48-room Denver mansion.<ref name=\"SOE\">{{Cite book |last=Schemering |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Schemering |title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Schemering book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]] |date=September 1985 |pages=80\u201381 |isbn=0-345-32459-5}}</ref> Esther Shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was ''[[I, Claudius]]'', a fictionalized depiction of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] of [[Roman emperor]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-good-the-bad-and-the-wildly-bitchy-2192378.html |title=The good, the bad and the wildly bitchy |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent.co.uk|first=Fiona |last=Sturges |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Shapiro said in 1985, \"We wanted to do something that would be fun, an American fantasy.

Jay Pepper answered the advert.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio>{{cite web|title=Tigertailz biography |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tigertailz/pages/biography.shtml|work=Wales Music|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> Local guitarist Phil Harling and singer Jim Dovey joined and the band began to write and record demos, although the demos were never released. The band began to get gigs and they started to amass a local following, however lead singer Jim Dovey soon left the band therefore Pepper and Tate placed an advert in the ''National Sounds'' magazine and vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]] answered the call and joined the band. Welch left the band in 1984 and was finally replaced with Ace Finchum.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n\n==Commercial success (1987-1995)==\nPart of the nascent [[glam metal]] scene in the late 1980s, Tigertailz first line-up issued their debut album, ''[[Young and Crazy (Tigertailz album)|Young And Crazy]]'', in 1987.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> The album featured vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]], guitarist Jay Pepper, bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ace Finchum.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=363}}</ref> The debut album also provided their first single, \"Livin' Without You\".\n\nAs the band toured, vocalist Steevi Jaimz was not fully committed to the band, and several instances of fighting were recorded. The band recruited Kim Hooker to replace Jaimz in time for follow-up album, ''Bezerk'', which was released in 1990 on the [[Music For Nations]] [[record label|label]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'', the band re-recorded \"Livin Without' You\" with Hooker as vocalist, and released it as a single. ''Bezerk'' saw the band breakthrough as a headline act, and delivering three singles, \"Love Bomb Baby\",<ref name=\"Kerrang Bomb\">Ray Zell [http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/tigertailz---june-1989.html \"The Bomb Party\"], ''Kerrang'', June 1989 (copy online at Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com).

The album peaked at No.&nbsp;36 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nThey released ''[[Banzai! (Tigertailz Album)|Banzai!]]'', a collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and re-recorded tracks, in 1991 in [[Japan]]. They also issued ''[[Wazbones (Tigertailz Album)|Wazbones]]'' in 1995, by which time the Hooker-Pepper-Tate-Finchum line-up had fragmented, and was replaced by the Hooker-Danahar-Tate-Skinner line-up. Touring proved successful, but there was insufficient record label interest to sustain the band.\n\n==Reunion (2005-2009)==\nIn 2005, the band reformed their classic line-up, with the addition of former City Kidds drummer Matt Blakout, who replaced Andy Skinner. The band won a court order winning ownership of the Tigertailz name from a spin-off band fronted by Steevi Jaimz. This problem resolved, Tigertailz were able to work on ''[[Bezerk 2.0]]''.\n\nThey completed a short reunion tour of the UK, culminating in some festival dates in Sweden and Spain, playing to over 70,000 people with [[Whitesnake]] and [[Twisted Sister]]. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine wrote in praise of the reunion; journalist [[Steve Beebee]] describing it as \"persistently entertaining, with monstrous melodies that reach delirious peaks\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n''Bezerk 2.0'' was released through [[Demolition Records]] on 7 August 2006. Bass player Pepsi Tate was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. The band signed a new [[recording contract]] with [[Sanctuary Records]], and released ''Thrill Pistol'' on 27 August 2007, barely a year after their previous album release. This release was a [[double album]], packaged with the original 1992 version of the ''Wazbones'' album, that had never been officially released. Beebee again wrote in praise of the album in ''[[Kerrang!]]'', calling on fans to \"kindly hail this rejuvenated band for the time-defying devils they are\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Following Tate's death in September 2007, Tigertailz continued to tour with former City Kidds lead guitarist, Glenn 'Nailz' Quinn, playing bass. As well as numerous European festival shows, they supported ex-[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] guitarist [[Ace Frehley]] in the UK, and performed at the UK's [[Hard Rock Hell]] Festival in both 2008 and 2009.\n\n==Bezerk anniversary (2010)==\nIn January 2010, Tigertailz recruited Sarah Firebrand as their new bass player. They also announced that they would be playing ''Bezerk'', originally released in 1990, in its entirety and in sequence at some subsequent live shows. Some of these performances were recorded for use as a future live album. After playing a show at the Fuel Rock Club in Cardiff on 17 April to raise money for the Amser Justin Time charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory, the band headlined the Stockholm Rock Out Festival in Sweden on 1 May.\n\nFollowing further 'Bezerk Live' dates, Tigertailz replaced drummer Matt Blakout with former [[Rachel Stamp]] sticksman Robin Guy. Tigertailz headlined the first night of 2010's [[Hard Rock Hell]] and released ''Bezerk Live - Burnin' Fuel'' on 6 December. In June 2011, it was announced, via the band's website, that Ace Finchum had re-joined the band.\n\nThey were expected to record their next studio album in 2011 but on 23 November, in an interview with Queens Of Steel webzine, [ [http://www.queensofsteel.com/2005/11/tigertailz-eng/ Queens Of Steel - Tigertailz interview] ] Jay Pepper cast doubt on the future of the band, stating that it was \"facing a crossroads as to its survival. I don't know if we can survive the latest troubles.\" Suggesting that Tigertailz might still continue \"with a different line-up\" the band parted company with Sarah Firebrand in late 2011, this being made public in a statement issued on 9 January 2012 [ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/01/09/tailz-part-company-with-firebrand |title=News |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ].

They further described themselves as \"relieved\".\n\n==New line-up (2012)==\nOn 26 June 2012, Tigertailz announced its new line-up, and a European tour for September and October. Joining original members Jay Pepper and Ace Finchum were Jules Millis (vocals), Rob Wylde (guitar) and Jason Sims (bass). The band re-recorded an old song, \"Fall In Love Again\", and filmed a video for it - with all proceeds going towards a charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/06/25/tailz-unleash-new-line-up/|title=TIGERTAILZ UNLEASH NEW LINE-UP!|website=Tigertailz.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}\n\nAfter a tour and an appearance at the [[Hard Rock Hell]] festival, this line-up fragmented in 2013. In a statement, Jay Pepper confirmed that there would be no reunion but that he would continue to perform as Tigertailz, and in June 2013 it was confirmed that drummer Matthew Blakout had re-joined the band, with Wylde switching from guitar to bass, and a new EP 'Knives' being prepared for release.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, the ''Classic Rock Magazine'' website premiered Tigertailz latest video \"The Shoe Collector\", ahead of the release of the \"Knives\" EP on 15 October.

The song was included on the largely ignored 2016 ''Blast'' album released on the bands own TT Records.\n\nIn 2019, the band were forced to cancel an appearance at Hard Rock Hell due to guitarist Jay Pepper's worsening hearing loss.\n\n==Bare Knuckle Messiahs==\nA second Tigertailz reunion (of sorts) took place in 2019 when departed vocalist Kim Hooker announced his new band Bare Knuckle Messiahs which features Hooker on vocals and guitar, joined by two former \"Wazbones\" era Tigertailz members, guitarist Cy Danaher and drummer Andy Skinner, with the line up being rounded out with the addition of bassist JJ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.blabbermouth.net/news/former-tigertailz-frontman-kim-hooker-launches-bare-knuckle-messiahs/|title=Former TIGERTAILZ Frontman KIM HOOKER Launches BARE KNUCKLE MESSIAHS|date=14 February 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Hooker's new band released their debut album ''That Which Preys On The Dead'' through the DIAFOL label in October 2019.\n\n==Band members==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2013}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Original members<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n* [[Pepsi Tate]] -Bass (1983-1996, 2005-2007)\n* Ian Welsh -

They are most famous for their 1990 album, ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'' which made the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and spawned the hit singles \"Love Bomb Baby\" and \"Heaven\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 559}}</ref> The band reformed in 2005.\n\n==Formation and early years==\nTigertailz (originally called Stagefright) formed in 1983 after bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ian Welch placed an advert in the Cardiff record store, Spillers Records, looking for a guitarist. Jay Pepper answered the advert.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio>{{cite web|title=Tigertailz biography |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tigertailz/pages/biography.shtml|work=Wales Music|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> Local guitarist Phil Harling and singer Jim Dovey joined and the band began to write and record demos, although the demos were never released. The band began to get gigs and they started to amass a local following, however lead singer Jim Dovey soon left the band therefore Pepper and Tate placed an advert in the ''National Sounds'' magazine and vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]] answered the call and joined the band. Welch left the band in 1984 and was finally replaced with Ace Finchum.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n\n==Commercial success (1987-1995)==\nPart of the nascent [[glam metal]] scene in the late 1980s, Tigertailz first line-up issued their debut album, ''[[Young and Crazy (Tigertailz album)|Young And Crazy]]'', in 1987.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> The album featured vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]], guitarist Jay Pepper, bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ace Finchum.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=363}}</ref> The debut album also provided their first single, \"Livin' Without You\".\n\nAs the band toured, vocalist Steevi Jaimz was not fully committed to the band, and several instances of fighting were recorded. The band recruited Kim Hooker to replace Jaimz in time for follow-up album, ''Bezerk'', which was released in 1990 on the [[Music For Nations]] [[record label|label]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'', the band re-recorded \"Livin Without' You\" with Hooker as vocalist, and released it as a single. ''Bezerk'' saw the band breakthrough as a headline act, and delivering three singles, \"Love Bomb Baby\",<ref name=\"Kerrang Bomb\">Ray Zell [http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/tigertailz---june-1989.html \"The Bomb Party\"], ''Kerrang'', June 1989 (copy online at Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com).

The album peaked at No.&nbsp;36 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nThey released ''[[Banzai! (Tigertailz Album)|Banzai!]]'', a collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and re-recorded tracks, in 1991 in [[Japan]]. They also issued ''[[Wazbones (Tigertailz Album)|Wazbones]]'' in 1995, by which time the Hooker-Pepper-Tate-Finchum line-up had fragmented, and was replaced by the Hooker-Danahar-Tate-Skinner line-up. Touring proved successful, but there was insufficient record label interest to sustain the band.\n\n==Reunion (2005-2009)==\nIn 2005, the band reformed their classic line-up, with the addition of former City Kidds drummer Matt Blakout, who replaced Andy Skinner. The band won a court order winning ownership of the Tigertailz name from a spin-off band fronted by Steevi Jaimz. This problem resolved, Tigertailz were able to work on ''[[Bezerk 2.0]]''.\n\nThey completed a short reunion tour of the UK, culminating in some festival dates in Sweden and Spain, playing to over 70,000 people with [[Whitesnake]] and [[Twisted Sister]]. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine wrote in praise of the reunion; journalist [[Steve Beebee]] describing it as \"persistently entertaining, with monstrous melodies that reach delirious peaks\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n''Bezerk 2.0'' was released through [[Demolition Records]] on 7 August 2006. Bass player Pepsi Tate was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. The band signed a new [[recording contract]] with [[Sanctuary Records]], and released ''Thrill Pistol'' on 27 August 2007, barely a year after their previous album release. This release was a [[double album]], packaged with the original 1992 version of the ''Wazbones'' album, that had never been officially released. Beebee again wrote in praise of the album in ''[[Kerrang!]]'', calling on fans to \"kindly hail this rejuvenated band for the time-defying devils they are\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Following Tate's death in September 2007, Tigertailz continued to tour with former City Kidds lead guitarist, Glenn 'Nailz' Quinn, playing bass. As well as numerous European festival shows, they supported ex-[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] guitarist [[Ace Frehley]] in the UK, and performed at the UK's [[Hard Rock Hell]] Festival in both 2008 and 2009.\n\n==Bezerk anniversary (2010)==\nIn January 2010, Tigertailz recruited Sarah Firebrand as their new bass player. They also announced that they would be playing ''Bezerk'', originally released in 1990, in its entirety and in sequence at some subsequent live shows. Some of these performances were recorded for use as a future live album. After playing a show at the Fuel Rock Club in Cardiff on 17 April to raise money for the Amser Justin Time charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory, the band headlined the Stockholm Rock Out Festival in Sweden on 1 May.\n\nFollowing further 'Bezerk Live' dates, Tigertailz replaced drummer Matt Blakout with former [[Rachel Stamp]] sticksman Robin Guy. Tigertailz headlined the first night of 2010's [[Hard Rock Hell]] and released ''Bezerk Live - Burnin' Fuel'' on 6 December. In June 2011, it was announced, via the band's website, that Ace Finchum had re-joined the band.\n\nThey were expected to record their next studio album in 2011 but on 23 November, in an interview with Queens Of Steel webzine, [ [http://www.queensofsteel.com/2005/11/tigertailz-eng/ Queens Of Steel - Tigertailz interview] ] Jay Pepper cast doubt on the future of the band, stating that it was \"facing a crossroads as to its survival. I don't know if we can survive the latest troubles.\" Suggesting that Tigertailz might still continue \"with a different line-up\" the band parted company with Sarah Firebrand in late 2011, this being made public in a statement issued on 9 January 2012 [ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/01/09/tailz-part-company-with-firebrand |title=News |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ]. Frontman Kim Hooker went the same way on 28 March 2012, the remaining members citing 'a total breakdown of relationship resulting from the singer's unprofessional conduct'[ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/03/28/tailz-no-longer-hooked/ |title=Tailz No longer Hooked |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ]. They further described themselves as \"relieved\".\n\n==New line-up (2012)==\nOn 26 June 2012, Tigertailz announced its new line-up, and a European tour for September and October. Joining original members Jay Pepper and Ace Finchum were Jules Millis (vocals), Rob Wylde (guitar) and Jason Sims (bass). The band re-recorded an old song, \"Fall In Love Again\", and filmed a video for it - with all proceeds going towards a charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/06/25/tailz-unleash-new-line-up/|title=TIGERTAILZ UNLEASH NEW LINE-UP!|website=Tigertailz.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}\n\nAfter a tour and an appearance at the [[Hard Rock Hell]] festival, this line-up fragmented in 2013. In a statement, Jay Pepper confirmed that there would be no reunion but that he would continue to perform as Tigertailz, and in June 2013 it was confirmed that drummer Matthew Blakout had re-joined the band, with Wylde switching from guitar to bass, and a new EP 'Knives' being prepared for release.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, the ''Classic Rock Magazine'' website premiered Tigertailz latest video \"The Shoe Collector\", ahead of the release of the \"Knives\" EP on 15 October. The magazine described it as \"a major step on Tigertailz\u2019 road back from the brink\".<ref name=\"CRM premiere\">{{cite news |last=Kielty |first=Martin |title=Video Premiere: Tigertailz \u2013 The Shoe Collector |work=Classic Rock Magazine |date=7 October 2013 |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/music_and_videos/video-premiere-tigertailz-the-shoe-collector/ |accessdate=2013-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128111144/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/music_and_videos/video-premiere-tigertailz-the-shoe-collector/ |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 17 February 2014, Classic Rock premiered the second video release from \"Knives\" EP \"One Life\".

They supported [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Cheap Trick]] on the 2014 Kiss Kruise.\n\nA further line up change happened in 2015 when vocalist Jules Mills was replaced by guitarist turned bassist now turned vocalist Rob Wylde, with the bass position being filled by Berty Burton.\n\nIn 2016, this line up released the song \"Pipped It, Popped It\" which they - unsuccessfully - submitted for consideration as a UK [[Eurovision Song Contest]] entry. The song was included on the largely ignored 2016 ''Blast'' album released on the bands own TT Records.\n\nIn 2019, the band were forced to cancel an appearance at Hard Rock Hell due to guitarist Jay Pepper's worsening hearing loss.\n\n==Bare Knuckle Messiahs==\nA second Tigertailz reunion (of sorts) took place in 2019 when departed vocalist Kim Hooker announced his new band Bare Knuckle Messiahs which features Hooker on vocals and guitar, joined by two former \"Wazbones\" era Tigertailz members, guitarist Cy Danaher and drummer Andy Skinner, with the line up being rounded out with the addition of bassist JJ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.blabbermouth.net/news/former-tigertailz-frontman-kim-hooker-launches-bare-knuckle-messiahs/|title=Former TIGERTAILZ Frontman KIM HOOKER Launches BARE KNUCKLE MESSIAHS|date=14 February 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Hooker's new band released their debut album ''That Which Preys On The Dead'' through the DIAFOL label in October 2019.\n\n==Band members==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2013}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Original members<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n* [[Pepsi Tate]] -Bass (1983-1996, 2005-2007)\n* Ian Welsh -
