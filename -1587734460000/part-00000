Stardom was founded in September 2010 by former promoter of [[Arsion|Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion]] and [[JDStar]], and former co-producer of [[All Japan Women]] (AJW), Rossy Ogawa, retired [[Professional wrestler]] and [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] [[Fuka Kakimoto]], and All Japan Women veteran professional wrestler [[Nanae Takahashi]]. Since its debut on January 23 2011 Stardom has established itself as the top ''joshi puroresu'' promotion in Japan, as well as the top Women's promotion in the world. Rossy Ogawa has served as head producer of Stardom since its inception, and as of October 2019, has been owned by Japanese card game company [[Bushiroad]]. \n\nStardom frequently holds shows in [[Tokyo]] such as [[Korakuen Hall]] and [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]], while also often traveling to [[Osaka]] for daytime and nighttime events within the same day. Stardom held its first ever [[Pay-per-view|PPV]] overseas on April 5 2019 titled \" Stardom American Dream in the Big Apple\" which took place in Queens, New York City. This marked the first ever time that a Joshi Puroresu promotion would hold a PPV in the United States. As of January 2 2020, \"We Are Stardom!!\" has aired on [[Nippon BS Broadcasting]] and [[Tokyo MX]] as a 30 min show involving various recent matches and happenings. This also marks the first time since the late 1980s with [[All Japan Women]] that a [[Joshi Puroresu]] promotion has had a National Television program on a weekly basis. Stardom launched \"Stardom World\" in February 2016, its own dedicated video service that uploads every single show they produce, with added subtitles during interviews.   \n\nStardom's championship belts consist of the [[World of Stardom Championship]], usually referred to as \"the red belt,\" the [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]], usually referred to as \"the White belt,\" the [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] (Black), the [[Artist of Stardom Championship]] (Pink, Orange, light blue), the [[High Speed Championship]], the [[Future of Stardom Championship]], and the [[SWA World Championship]]. Units (or factions\\stables) have played a significant part throughout Stardom's history, and as of 2020, the units consist of [[STARS]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, [[Oedo Tai]], [[Queen's Quest]], [[Tokyo Cyber Squad]], and [[Donna del Mondo]]. Stardom holds various annual tournaments and notable events such as the [[5* Grand Prix]], a round-robin point based league, the [[Cinderella tournament]], which is a one-day single elimination tournament, and the [[Goddesses of Stardom tag league]], which is a round-robin based tournament for tag teams. Some of Stardom's most defining names include [[Mayu Iwatani]], who is the only wrestler on the roster to have remained since the very first show in 2011, and has held the [[World of Stardom Championship]] twice, as well as being the only person to hold both the World and Wonder championships at the same time. [[Io Shirai]], also winning the [[World of Stardom Championship]] twice, holds the record of longest time combined as World of Stardom champion with two separate reigns. Both Iwatani and Shirai are the only two to have held every major title in Stardom history. Io Shirai currently holds the record for World of Stardom championship defenses at 14, the most of any belt in Stardom. [[Momo Watanabe]] currently holds the record for the [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]] defenses at 13. Io Shirai and Mayu Iwatani hold the record for most defenses of the [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] at 11.\n          \n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning and Formation===\n[[File:Fuka.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Fuka Kakimoto|Fuka]], the General Manager of Stardom]]\nAfter retiring from [[professional wrestling]] on March 29, 2010, [[Fuka Kakimoto|Fuka]] began training [[Yuzuki Aikawa]], a notable [[gravure idol]] signed to [[Platinum Production]], the same modeling agency as her, for a career in professional wrestling.<ref name=History>{{cite web | url = http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page132061.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121015021139/http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page132061.html | title = History | archivedate=October 15, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | work=World Wonder Ring Stardom | language=Japanese}}</ref> In April 2010, Fuka was approached by Rossy Ogawa, the former promoter of [[JDStar]], where she had spent most of her career, about starting a new promotion with Aikawa as the top star.<ref name=History/> During the summer of 2010, Fuka continued training Aikawa for her upcoming debut planned for October 2010, an Aikawa self-produced show, and meanwhile was also training new trainees consisting of names like [[Mayu Iwatani]], [[Arisa Hoshiki]], [[Yoshiko]], [[Yoko Bito]], and Eri Susa.

Wakizawa was a friend of [[Nanae Takahashi]] who originally trained in the same AJW class as Takahashi, and had retired on December 16 2001.\n\n===2012===\n\nA new class of Stardom trainees had began training with Stardom since August 2011 and were revealed by the end of the year. the first of the new class to debut was Haruka Kato (then known as Yuuri Haruka) on December 25 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] against [[Natsuki Taiyo]]. The other trainees included Kairi Hojo ([[Kairi Sane]]), [[Act Yasukawa]], [[Natsumi Showzuki]], and 9-year old Azumi ([[AZM]]), all debuting at the beginning of 2012, except for Azumi, who eventually made her first match appearance in October 2013 at the age of 11. The next to debut was [[Kairi Hojo]], who previously had a background in [[yachting]] at an [[Olympic]] level, faced [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] on January 7 2012 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]]. Next to debut was [[Natsumi Showzuki]] on January 22 2012 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] against [[Io Shirai]]. Following this, [[Act Yasukawa]] debuted on February 5 2012 in [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] defeating Yuuri Haruka. During this period, Stardom had also began forming official units (stables\\factions) for the first time, a staple that has lasted ever since. Various member changes occurred as time went on but the initial units were as follows: \"Nanae Gundam\" consisted of [[Nanae Takahash]], Eri Susa, [[Miho Wakizawa]], and Yuuri Haruka. \"Planet\" consisted of [[Io Shirai]], [[Mayu Iwatani]], [[Arisa Hoshiki]], and [[Natsumi Showzuki]]. [[Natsuki Taiyo]] and [[Yoshiko]] shared leadership over \"Kawasaki Katsushika Saikyou Densetsu\" which also included [[Act Yasukawa]]. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] and [[Yoko Bito]] both lead a team that also involved [[Kairi Hojo]] and [[Saki Kashima]]. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] successfully defended her [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]] against [[Miho Wakizawa]] on February 26 2012 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]]. [[Io Shirai]] held a special 5th Anniversary show at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] on March 4 2012, where she announced she was officially joining the Stardom roster, having been freelance up until that point. Stardom would hold their second ever [[korakuen Hall]] show on March 20 2012, the first since July 24 2011. \"Stardom the Highest\" included a new ring canvas with the Stardom logo. It was headlined by [[Nanae Takahashi]] defending her [[World of Stardom Championship]] against fellow [[Joshi Puroresu]] legend [[Meiko Satomura]], Takahashi was successful in her second defense. BY Hou ([[Yuzuki Aikawa]] and [[Yoko Bito]]) successfully defended their [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] against Kawasaki Katsushika Saikyou Densetsu ([[Yoshiko]] and [[Natsuki Taiyo]]) for the first time since winning it in the November 2011 [[Goddesses of Stardom Tag League]]. Other matches on the card included a series of singles matches as the first class of rookies faced off against the second class of rookies. [[Natsuki Taiyo]] successfully defended the [[High Speed Championship]] against [[Io Shirai]] on March 25 in Osaka. It would only be two months until Stardom's next Korakuen Hall show this time. \"Stardom Golden stars\" took place on May 3 2012 with [[Hiroyo Matsumoto]] challenging [[Nanae Takahashi]] for the [[World of Stardom Championship]] in an unsuccessful attempt, making it Takahashi's third defense. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] was injured at this time and as a result could not compete on this show. A new [[Joshi]] wrestler by the name of \"Yuhi\" from the [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]] promotion had recently debuted the month before, in which Yuzuki Aikawa was invited to face her in a debut match. As a result, Yuhi made her first Stardom appearance on this [[Korakuen Hall]] show facing [[Io Shirai]], this marked the first of many regular appearances in Stardom for Yuhi. Well-known freelance veteran [[Kyoko Kimura]] also made her first appearance for Stardom on this show, in which she continued doing so for the rest of her career until 2017. Kimura teamed with [[Miho Wakizawa]] against [[Yoshiko]] and [[Natsuki Taiyo]]. Yoshiko attempted to recruit Kimura to her unit but Taiyo refused to allow her to join, and continued fighting after the match. May 20 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] would be the final time that top up-comer [[Arisa Hoshiki]] would appear for Stardom until returning in 2018. Ending in a time limit draw, Hoshiki faced 16-year old Yuhi, who had just began making regular appearances for Stardom outside her home promotion of [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]]. After the match, all the units in Stardom gathered in the ring to recruit the new rookie, Yuhi. Yuhi chose to join the unit of her debut opponent, [[Yuzuki Aikawa]]. BY Hou ([[Yuzuki Aikawa]] and [[Yoko Bito]]) made a successful defense of their Goddess of Stardom Championships on May 27 against [[Nanae Takahashi]] and [[Miho Wakizawa]]. On June 10 at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, the team of Yuzuki Aikawa, Yoko Bito, and Saki Kashima faced Yoshiko, Natsuki Taiyo, and Kyoko Kimura. Having lost the match to Taiyo, Kashima requested to join Natsuki's Kawasaki Katsushika Saikyou Densetsu unit.

[[women's professional wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] based in Tokyo, Japan. Stardom was founded in September 2010 by former promoter of [[Arsion|Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion]] and [[JDStar]], and former co-producer of [[All Japan Women]] (AJW), Rossy Ogawa, retired [[Professional wrestler]] and [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] [[Fuka Kakimoto]], and All Japan Women veteran professional wrestler [[Nanae Takahashi]]. Since its debut on January 23 2011 Stardom has established itself as the top ''joshi puroresu'' promotion in Japan, as well as the top Women's promotion in the world. Rossy Ogawa has served as head producer of Stardom since its inception, and as of October 2019, has been owned by Japanese card game company [[Bushiroad]]. \n\nStardom frequently holds shows in [[Tokyo]] such as [[Korakuen Hall]] and [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]], while also often traveling to [[Osaka]] for daytime and nighttime events within the same day. Stardom held its first ever [[Pay-per-view|PPV]] overseas on April 5 2019 titled \" Stardom American Dream in the Big Apple\" which took place in Queens, New York City. This marked the first ever time that a Joshi Puroresu promotion would hold a PPV in the United States. As of January 2 2020, \"We Are Stardom!!\" has aired on [[Nippon BS Broadcasting]] and [[Tokyo MX]] as a 30 min show involving various recent matches and happenings. This also marks the first time since the late 1980s with [[All Japan Women]] that a [[Joshi Puroresu]] promotion has had a National Television program on a weekly basis. Stardom launched \"Stardom World\" in February 2016, its own dedicated video service that uploads every single show they produce, with added subtitles during interviews.   \n\nStardom's championship belts consist of the [[World of Stardom Championship]], usually referred to as \"the red belt,\" the [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]], usually referred to as \"the White belt,\" the [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] (Black), the [[Artist of Stardom Championship]] (Pink, Orange, light blue), the [[High Speed Championship]], the [[Future of Stardom Championship]], and the [[SWA World Championship]]. Units (or factions\\stables) have played a significant part throughout Stardom's history, and as of 2020, the units consist of [[STARS]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, [[Oedo Tai]], [[Queen's Quest]], [[Tokyo Cyber Squad]], and [[Donna del Mondo]]. Stardom holds various annual tournaments and notable events such as the [[5* Grand Prix]], a round-robin point based league, the [[Cinderella tournament]], which is a one-day single elimination tournament, and the [[Goddesses of Stardom tag league]], which is a round-robin based tournament for tag teams. Some of Stardom's most defining names include [[Mayu Iwatani]], who is the only wrestler on the roster to have remained since the very first show in 2011, and has held the [[World of Stardom Championship]] twice, as well as being the only person to hold both the World and Wonder championships at the same time. [[Io Shirai]], also winning the [[World of Stardom Championship]] twice, holds the record of longest time combined as World of Stardom champion with two separate reigns. Both Iwatani and Shirai are the only two to have held every major title in Stardom history. Io Shirai currently holds the record for World of Stardom championship defenses at 14, the most of any belt in Stardom. [[Momo Watanabe]] currently holds the record for the [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]] defenses at 13. Io Shirai and Mayu Iwatani hold the record for most defenses of the [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] at 11.\n          \n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning and Formation===\n[[File:Fuka.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Fuka Kakimoto|Fuka]], the General Manager of Stardom]]\nAfter retiring from [[professional wrestling]] on March 29, 2010, [[Fuka Kakimoto|Fuka]] began training [[Yuzuki Aikawa]], a notable [[gravure idol]] signed to [[Platinum Production]], the same modeling agency as her, for a career in professional wrestling.<ref name=History>{{cite web | url = http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page132061.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121015021139/http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page132061.html | title = History | archivedate=October 15, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | work=World Wonder Ring Stardom | language=Japanese}}</ref> In April 2010, Fuka was approached by Rossy Ogawa, the former promoter of [[JDStar]], where she had spent most of her career, about starting a new promotion with Aikawa as the top star.<ref name=History/> During the summer of 2010, Fuka continued training Aikawa for her upcoming debut planned for October 2010, an Aikawa self-produced show, and meanwhile was also training new trainees consisting of names like [[Mayu Iwatani]], [[Arisa Hoshiki]], [[Yoshiko]], [[Yoko Bito]], and Eri Susa.

On November 12 at Stardom's home ground, [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]], [[Nanae Takahashi]] successfully defended her [[World of Stardom Championship]] against [[Natsuki Taiyo]] for her first defense since winning it on July 24. Freelancer [[Hiroyo Matsumoto]] also began making regular appearances for Stardom during this time.

The final saw [[Yoshiko]] defeating [[Arisa Hoshiki]] at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] to become Stardom's first ever Rookie of Stardom winner. On December 23 in Osaka, [[Arisa Hoshiki]] made her first challenge to a singles title in Stardom when she took on [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] for the [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]] in which Aikawa successfully defended. Stardom was also joined in late 2011 by [[All Japan Women]] (AJW) veteran [[Miho Wakizawa]], in a return match against Nanae Takahashi on December 25 2011 at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring. Wakizawa was a friend of [[Nanae Takahashi]] who originally trained in the same AJW class as Takahashi, and had retired on December 16 2001.\n\n===2012===\n\nA new class of Stardom trainees had began training with Stardom since August 2011 and were revealed by the end of the year. the first of the new class to debut was Haruka Kato (then known as Yuuri Haruka) on December 25 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] against [[Natsuki Taiyo]]. The other trainees included Kairi Hojo ([[Kairi Sane]]), [[Act Yasukawa]], [[Natsumi Showzuki]], and 9-year old Azumi ([[AZM]]), all debuting at the beginning of 2012, except for Azumi, who eventually made her first match appearance in October 2013 at the age of 11. The next to debut was [[Kairi Hojo]], who previously had a background in [[yachting]] at an [[Olympic]] level, faced [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] on January 7 2012 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]]. Next to debut was [[Natsumi Showzuki]] on January 22 2012 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] against [[Io Shirai]]. Following this, [[Act Yasukawa]] debuted on February 5 2012 in [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] defeating Yuuri Haruka. During this period, Stardom had also began forming official units (stables\\factions) for the first time, a staple that has lasted ever since. Various member changes occurred as time went on but the initial units were as follows: \"Nanae Gundam\" consisted of [[Nanae Takahash]], Eri Susa, [[Miho Wakizawa]], and Yuuri Haruka. \"Planet\" consisted of [[Io Shirai]], [[Mayu Iwatani]], [[Arisa Hoshiki]], and [[Natsumi Showzuki]].

[[Yuzuki Aikawa]] successfully defended her [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]] against [[Miho Wakizawa]] on February 26 2012 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]]. [[Io Shirai]] held a special 5th Anniversary show at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] on March 4 2012, where she announced she was officially joining the Stardom roster, having been freelance up until that point. Stardom would hold their second ever [[korakuen Hall]] show on March 20 2012, the first since July 24 2011. \"Stardom the Highest\" included a new ring canvas with the Stardom logo.

Other matches on the card included a series of singles matches as the first class of rookies faced off against the second class of rookies. [[Natsuki Taiyo]] successfully defended the [[High Speed Championship]] against [[Io Shirai]] on March 25 in Osaka. It would only be two months until Stardom's next Korakuen Hall show this time. \"Stardom Golden stars\" took place on May 3 2012 with [[Hiroyo Matsumoto]] challenging [[Nanae Takahashi]] for the [[World of Stardom Championship]] in an unsuccessful attempt, making it Takahashi's third defense. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] was injured at this time and as a result could not compete on this show. A new [[Joshi]] wrestler by the name of \"Yuhi\" from the [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]] promotion had recently debuted the month before, in which Yuzuki Aikawa was invited to face her in a debut match. As a result, Yuhi made her first Stardom appearance on this [[Korakuen Hall]] show facing [[Io Shirai]], this marked the first of many regular appearances in Stardom for Yuhi. Well-known freelance veteran [[Kyoko Kimura]] also made her first appearance for Stardom on this show, in which she continued doing so for the rest of her career until 2017. Kimura teamed with [[Miho Wakizawa]] against [[Yoshiko]] and [[Natsuki Taiyo]]. Yoshiko attempted to recruit Kimura to her unit but Taiyo refused to allow her to join, and continued fighting after the match. May 20 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] would be the final time that top up-comer [[Arisa Hoshiki]] would appear for Stardom until returning in 2018.

The team of [[Natsuki Taiyo]], [[Saki Kashima]], and [[Act Yasukawa]] defeated the team of [[Tomoka Nakagawa]], [[Kelly Skater]], and [[Portia Perez]] (representing the American Women's promotion [[Shimmer]]) in the finals to become the first ever Artist of Stardom champions. However, the new belts themselves had not yet arrived in Japan, and as a result Taiyo, Yasukawa, and Kashima celebrated by pretending to hold up their newly won titles. On January 20, [[Yoshiko]] and [[Natsuki Taiyo]] defended their [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] against [[Mayu Iwatani]] and [[Io Shirai]] of the \"Planet\" unit. At this time, [[Saki Kashima]] had departed wrestling, but would eventually return in 2018. At the same time, [[JWP]] veteran [[Kaori Yoneyama]] made a surprise appearance at the end of Stardom's February 3 [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] show, announcing she would be regularly appearing in Stardom going forward. Yoneyama would continue her involvement with Stardom for years to come. Natsuki Taiyo and Yoshiko made another successful [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]] defense on February 10 against Nanae Takahashi and Miho Wakizawa. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] also was successful in defending her Wonder of Stardom title against Natsumi Showzuki on the same show. Sumire Yoshino, the latest debuting wrestler faced Yoshiko on February 17 at Shin-Kiba 1st Ring. Kaori Yoneyama had her first title shot since arriving in Stardom on March 3 when she unsuccessfully challenged Natsuki Taiyo for the [[High Speed Championship]]. Stardom's next [[Korakuen Hall]] show on March 17, \"Stardom the Highest,\" would mark a World of Stardom title change for the first time ever when returning German [[Alpha Female]] (now aligned with Kyoko Kimura's \"Kimura Monster-gun\" unit, defeated [[Nanae Takahashi]] for \"the red belt.\"<ref name=Season14/><ref name=Season11/> Alpha Female had previously gone to a time limit draw with Takahashi in late 2012. [[Nanae Takahashi]] had held the [[World of Stardom Championship]] since its initial crowning on July 24 2011. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] during this time was beginning to have a series of singles matches against members of the Stardom roster for her retirement countdown on April 29, and on this show she also faced [[Joshi Puroresu]] veteran [[Meiko Satomura]]. [[Kairi Hojo]] and Natsumi Showzuki (Ho-Show Tennyo) won a tag team gauntlet match to become the number one contenders for the [[Goddess of Stardom Championship]], while [[Kyoko Kimura]] and [[Hailey Hatred]] (Kimura Monster-gun) dethroned Natsuki Taiyo and Yoshiko to become the new Goddesses of Stardom champions. On March 24 in Osaka, [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] continued her retirement countdown by teaming with career rival [[Yoshiko]] against [[Nanae Takahashi]] and [[Natsuki Taiyo]]. [[Io Shirai]] also earned number-one contendership for Alpha Female's [[World of Stardom Championship]] on April 29 at [[Ry\u014dgoku]] by defeating [[Dark Angel]]. [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] made another successful defense of her [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]] on March 31 at [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] by defeating [[Act Yasukawa]]. On the final [[Shin-Kiba 1st Ring]] show before \"Ry\u014dgoku Cinderella\" on April 29, [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] had the first of what would become a tradition for many departing Stardom wrestlers in the form of a [[gauntlet match]], where they would take on the entire roster in one-minute singles matches. \"Stardom Ry\u014dgoku Cinderella Champions Fiesta 2013\" was the biggest event in the history of [[World Wonder Ring Stardom]] in its two year history to that point, taking place April 29, 2013 at the historic [[Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan]] (also known as Ry\u014dgoku Sumo Hall) venue in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page224265.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130522055653/http://wwr-stardom.p-kit.com/page224265.html | title = Ryougoku Cinderella | archivedate=May 22, 2013 | accessdate=April 3, 2013 | work=World Wonder Ring Stardom | language=Japanese}}</ref> It was the first ''joshi Puroresu'' event held in the venue in six years.<ref name=RyogokuAnnouncementNikkanSports/> [[Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan]] had also hosted many [[Professional Wrestling]] events in its history, with [[All Japan Women]] being among them. The card, which was revealed on April 2, 2013, featured four of Stardom's five titles on the line, a debut, various participants from other wrestling promotions including Male wrestlers and [[Joshi Puroresu]] legends, and was headlined by the retirement match of [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] facing her longtime rival [[Yoshiko]] in the main event. The show opened with Stardom's newest rookies, Yui Yokoo and Sumire Yoshino taking on the [[Ice Ribbon]] team of [[Risa Sera]] and Rutsuko Yamaguchi. Former [[AJW]] [[ring announcer]] Nagaharu Imai, did special ring introductions for [[Manami Toyota]] and Miho Wakizawa's singles match. The third match included some wrestlers from [[DDT Pro-Wrestling]] with [[Kota Ibushi]], Gota Ihashi, [[Lin Byron]], and [[Mayu Iwatani]] taking on Eri Susa, [[Hikaru Sato]], [[Makoto]], and Michael Nakazawa. [[Takumi Iroha]] made her debut against [[Meiko Satomura]] who she had requested to face on the March 17 [[Korakuen Hall]] show, to which Satomura accepted. [[Dark Angel]] defeated [[Act Yasukawa]] to win the new [[Wonder of Stardom Championship]], which [[Yuzuki Aikawa]] had recently vacated ahead of her retirement. [[Natsuki Taiyo]] retained her [[High Speed Championship]] against Yuhi. Ho-Show Tennyo ([[Kairi Hojo]] and [[Natsumi Showzuki]]) defeated Kimura Monster-gun ([[Kyoko Kimura]] and [[Hailey Hatred]]) to become the new Goddesses of Stardom Champions. [[Mika Nagano]] made her first appearance for Stardom since 2011, teaming with [[Nanae Takahashi]], and Ice Ribbon's [[Tsukasa Fujimoto]] to take on [[Hiroyo Matsumoto]], [[Kaori Yoneyama]], and Wrestling New Classic's [[Syuri]]. In the semi-main event, [[Io Shirai]] defeated [[Alpha Female]] to win her first [[World of Stardom Championship]].
