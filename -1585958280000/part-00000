Forest herbs in this zone commonly vegetate and flower in spring, as the crown of beech is very dense, and little light reaches the ground once the leaves appear.  Examples are ''[[Anemone]]'' spp. and ''[[Corydalis]]'' spp.  Oak (''[[Quercus robur]]'' and ''[[Quercus petraea]]'') forest occurs on poor soils.  Forest of alder (''[[Alnus glutinosa]]''), ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]'') and elm (''[[Ulmus glabra]]'') form in nutrient-rich wet soil, but most of these areas have long since been drained and converted to arable fields.\n\nMost of Sweden below the mountains is covered by [[conifer]] forest and forms part of the [[circumboreal]] zone. South of river [[Dal\u00e4lven]], there are scattered deciduous trees like oak (''Quercus robur''), and this zone is referred to as boreo-nemoral. North of Dal\u00e4lven, in the proper [[boreal]] ([[taiga]]) zone, deciduous trees are rarer, but birches (''[[Betula pubescens]]'' and ''[[Betula pendula]]'') and aspen (''[[Populus tremula]]'') may be abundant in early successional stages, such as after fire or in recently clear-cut areas. There are a total of four native conifers in Sweden, and of these only Norway spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') and Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') form forests, in pure or mixed stands. Spruce grows wetter and pine drier, but in bogs there are often numerous dwarfed pines. Undergrowth in spruce forest is commonly almost pure stands of bilberry (''[[Vaccinium myrtillus]]''). In wetter types ferns (e. g. ''[[Athyrium filix-femina]]'' and ''[[Dryopteris]]'' spp.) are abundant and in richer parts herbs (e. g., ''[[Paris quadrifolia]]'', ''[[Actaea spicata]]'') and broad-leaved grasses (e. g. ''[[Milium effusum]]''). In pine forest, lingonberries (''[[Vaccinium vitis-idaea]]''), heather (''[[Calluna vulgaris]]'') and/or ''[[Cladonia]]'' lichens are most common. Fires occur at irregular intervals, and usually kill all spruce and most pines. Fireweed (''[[Epilobium angustifolium]]''), raspberry (''[[Rubus idaeus]]'') and ''[[Geranium bohemicum]]'' are among the first plants to germinate in the ashes.\n\nThe forests of Sweden are intensively managed, excluding only some of the coldest areas and extremely rocky terrain. Fragments of [[old growth forest]] still remain near the mountains, but these mostly lack protection and are rapidly being lost. Native conifers are usually used, but some exotic species, particularly the North American lodgepole pine ''[[Pinus contorta]]'', are sometimes planted.\n\nIn the mountains, the conifers are replaced by birch (''Betula pubescens'' ssp. ''tortuosa''), which forms the tree-line in most areas. The undergrowth in these forests is quite variable. Under wet and nutrient-rich conditions, a luxuriant vegetation may develop, consisting of tall herbs such as ''[[Aconitum septentrionale]]'', ''[[Angelica archangelica]]''and ''[[Cicerbita alpina]]''. Above the birch forest, starting at 300\u20131000 m, depending on latitude, there are usually [[willow]]-thickets, and above these alpine heath or meadows, the former dominated by dwarf shrubs of the family [[Ericaceae]], the latter by sedges, [[rushes]] and various herbs such as ''[[Saxifraga]]'' spp., ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'' and ''[[Draba]]'' spp. ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]'' reaches the highest altitude of all plants, often growing near the ever-shrinking glaciers.\n\nWetlands cover large areas in Sweden; around 13%. In the south, [[raised bog]]s are a common variety. They are largely consisting of living and dead ''[[Sphagnum]]'' spp., with scattered dwarf shrubs and sedges such as ''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]''. In the wet southwest, ''[[Narthecium ossifragum]]'' and ''[[Erica tetralix]]'' occur in the bogs, while in the north and the east, the dwarf birch ''[[Betula nana]]'' and''[[Ledum palustre]]'', an evergreen shrub, are common. Rich [[fen]]s, with many [[sedges]] and orchids, are rather rare, except on [[Gotland]] and [[\u00d6land]], two large limestone islands in the Baltic, where ''[[Cladium]]''-dominated fens are common. In the north of Sweden, there are many large [[mire]] complexes with both fen- and bog-like parts.\n\nLakes are numerous (ca. 90000 larger than 1 hectare) and cover large areas (ca. 9% of the country). Most Swedish lakes are either nutrient poor with clear water and few plants (e.g. ''[[Lobelia dortmanna]]'' and ''[[Iso\u00ebtes]]'' spp.) or small [[ponds]] with brown water surrounded by floating mats of bog vegetation (e.g. sedges and ''[[Menyanthes trifoliata]]''). Nutrient rich lakes are found mostly in the south, and typically have dense [[reed]] stands, other emergent plants (e.g. ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'' and ''[[Sparganium erectum]]''), free-floating plants such as ''[[Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'' and ''[[Stratiotes aloides]]'', and submerged vegetation with spp. of ''[[Potamogeton]]'', ''[[Ranunculus]]'' etc.\n\nThe coast of Sweden is long, and conditions are quite different at the endpoints. Near the Norwegian border, conditions are typical North Atlantic, turning to subarctic near the Finnish border, where [[salinity]] is down to 0,1-0,2 %. A common seashore species there is the endemic, tussock-forming grass ''[[Deschampsia bottnica]]'', which survives the destructive force of the up to 2 m thick sea-ice. Common submerged vascular plants in this area, the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], are, among others ''[[Myriophyllum sibiricum]]'', ''[[Callitriche hermaphroditica]]'' and ''[[Stuckenia pectinata]]''. On the west coast, one may instead find ''[[Zostera marina]]'' in similar localities.\n\nThe highest part of the country is part of the [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands|Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands]] ecoregion. At the highest altitude is high [[alpine tundra]] with very modest vegetation and bare rock, skree, snowfields and glaciers. At lower altitude is low alpine tundra with continuous plant cover; [[Betula nana|dwarf birch]] and [[willow]]s up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and grasslands, as well as numerous lakes and [[bog]]s. At still lower altitude is the adjacent montane birch zone with small ({{convert|2|to|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) mountain downy birch (''Betula pubescens'') above the [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[tree line]]; some stunted [[Picea abies|spruce]] and [[Scots pine|pine]] also occur here.<ref name=WWF>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308074042/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/pa/pa1110.html |title=Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt lower altitudes in the northern and central parts of the country, coniferous forests in the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]] ecoregion occur. These are dominated by [[Scots pine]] (in drier locations), often with an understory of [[Juniperus communis|common juniper]], [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]] and [[Picea obovata|Siberian spruce]] and a significant admixture of [[Betula pubescens|downy birch]] and [[Betula pendula|silver birch]]. [[Aspen]] and birch occur throughout this region, and [[Larix sibirica|Siberian larch]] is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion. In the south east, there are scattered broad-leafed trees such as elm, ash and lime, but no oak.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/norra-barrskogsregionen/ |title=Norra barrskogsregionen |date=18 April 2017 |publisher=Skogskunskap |accessdate=22 February 2019|language=sv}}</ref>\n\nIn the south of the country there is a southern coniferous forest region, demarcated by the northerly limit of the oak and the southern limit of the natural regeneration of spruce.

Fires occur at irregular intervals, and usually kill all spruce and most pines. Fireweed (''[[Epilobium angustifolium]]''), raspberry (''[[Rubus idaeus]]'') and ''[[Geranium bohemicum]]'' are among the first plants to germinate in the ashes.\n\nThe forests of Sweden are intensively managed, excluding only some of the coldest areas and extremely rocky terrain. Fragments of [[old growth forest]] still remain near the mountains, but these mostly lack protection and are rapidly being lost. Native conifers are usually used, but some exotic species, particularly the North American lodgepole pine ''[[Pinus contorta]]'', are sometimes planted. \n\nIn the mountains, the conifers are replaced by birch (''Betula pubescens'' ssp. ''tortuosa''), which forms the tree-line in most areas. The undergrowth in these forests is quite variable. Under wet and nutrient-rich conditions, a luxuriant vegetation may develop, consisting of tall herbs such as ''[[Aconitum septentrionale]]'', ''[[Angelica archangelica]]''and ''[[Cicerbita alpina]]''. Above the birch forest, starting at 300-1000 m, depending on latitude, there are usually [[willow]]-thickets, and above these alpine heath or meadows, the former dominated by dwarf shrubs of the [[Ericaceae]] family, the latter by sedges, [[rushes]] and various herbs such as ''[[Saxifraga]]'' spp., ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'' and ''[[Draba]]'' spp. ''[[Ranunculus glacialis]]'' reaches the highest altitude of all plants, often growing near the ever-shrinking glaciers.\n\nWetlands cover large areas in Sweden; around 13 %. In the south, [[raised bog]]s are a common variety. They are largely consisting of living and dead ''[[Sphagnum]]'' spp., with scattered dwarf shrubs and sedges such as ''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]''. In the wet south-west, ''[[Narthecium ossifragum]]'' and ''[[Erica tetralix]]'' occur in the bogs, while in the north and the east, the dwarf birch ''[[Betula nana]]'' and''[[Ledum palustre]]'', an evergreen shrub, are common. Rich [[fen]]s, with many [[sedges]] and orchids, are rather rare, except on [[Gotland]] and [[\u00d6land]], two large limestone islands in the Baltic, where ''[[Cladium]]''-dominated fens are common. In the north of Sweden, there are many large [[mire]] complexes with both fen- and bog-like parts. \n\nLakes are numerous (ca. 90000 larger than 1 hectare) and cover large areas (ca. 9 % of the country). Most Swedish lakes are either nutrient poor with clear water and few plants (e.g. ''[[Lobelia dortmanna]]'' and ''[[Iso\u00ebtes]]'' spp.) or small [[ponds]] with brown water surrounded by floating mats of bog vegetation (e.g. sedges and ''[[Menyanthes trifoliata]]''). Nutrient rich lakes are found mostly in the south, and typically have dense [[reed]] stands, other emergent plants (e.g. ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'' and ''[[Sparganium erectum]]''), free-floating plants such as ''[[Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'' and ''[[Stratiotes aloides]]'', and submerged vegetation with spp. of ''[[Potamogeton]]'', ''[[Ranunculus]]'' etc.\n\nThe coast of Sweden is long, and conditions are quite different at the endpoints. Near the Norwegian border, conditions are typical North Atlantic, turning to subarctic near the Finnish border, where [[salinity]] is down to 0,1-0,2 %. A common seashore species there is the endemic, tussock-forming grass ''[[Deschampsia bottnica]]'', which survives the destructive force of the up to 2 m thick sea-ice. Common submerged vascular plants in this area, the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], are, among others ''[[Myriophyllum sibiricum]]'', ''[[Callitriche hermaphroditica]]'' and ''[[Stuckenia pectinata]]''. On the west coast, one may instead find ''[[Zostera marina]]'' in similar localities. \n\nThe highest part of the country is part of the [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands|Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands]] ecoregion. At the highest altitude is high [[alpine tundra]] with very modest vegetation and bare rock, skree, snowfields and glaciers. At lower altitude is low alpine tundra with continuous plant cover; [[Betula nana|dwarf birch]] and [[willow]]s up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and grasslands, as well as numerous lakes and [[bog]]s. At still lower altitude is the adjacent montane birch zone with small ({{convert|2|to|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) mountain downy birch (''Betula pubescens'') above the [[Pinophyta |conifer]] [[tree line]]; some stunted [[Picea abies|spruce]] and [[Scots pine|pine]] also occur here.<ref name=WWF>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308074042/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/pa/pa1110.html |title=Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt lower altitudes in the northern and central parts of the country, coniferous forests in the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]] ecoregion occur. These are dominated by [[Scots pine]] (in drier locations), often with an understory of [[Juniperus communis|common juniper]], [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]] and [[Picea obovata|Siberian spruce]] and a significant admixture of [[Betula pubescens|downy birch]] and [[Betula pendula|silver birch]]. [[Aspen]] and birch occur throughout this region, and [[Larix sibirica|Siberian larch]] is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion. In the south east, there are scattered broad-leafed trees such as elm, ash and lime, but no oak.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/norra-barrskogsregionen/ |title=Norra barrskogsregionen |date=18 April 2017 |publisher=Skogskunskap |accessdate=22 February 2019|language=sv}}</ref>\n\nIn the south of the country there is a southern coniferous forest region, demarcated by the northerly limit of the oak and the southern limit of the natural regeneration of spruce.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. Steered by two [[ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] to its north, the depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, with warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg), as measured by the [[Hurricane Hunters]]; this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. The hurricane's [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] shrank to as small as {{convert|2.3|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cyclone.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n[[File:Huricane Wilma.ogg|right|thumb|Satellite video of Wilma's lifespan]]\nAn [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]]. The hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===Cayman Islands and Central America===\n\n[[file:WilmaPeakFloater.gif|right|thumb|Animation of Hurricane Wilma at peak intensity, then undergoes an [[eyewall replacement cycle]] on October 19.]]\nThe [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) issued many [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches]] throughout Wilma's duration.

March 25, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Records and naming==\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe storm was named \"Wilma,\" the first time the 'W' name was used in the Atlantic Basin, since alphabetical naming began in 1950. With Wilma, the 2005 hurricane season broke the record for most storms in a season, previously held by the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]]. Moving slowly over warm water with little [[wind shear]], Wilma strengthened steadily and became a hurricane on October 18. The thirteenth hurricane of the season, Wilma broke the record set in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]] for most storms of hurricane strength in one season for the Atlantic Basin.\n\nThe [[barometric pressure]] measured in Wilma, {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, is currently the lowest recorded pressure for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin, as well as the second-lowest pressure for any cyclone measured in the Western Hemisphere, only after [[Hurricane Patricia]] ten years later in the Eastern Pacific. It also reached its {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} pressure in a span of 24&nbsp;hours, making it the fastest pressure drop of any storm in the Atlantic Basin, although [[Hurricane Felix]] of 2007 reached a greater windspeed rise in 51&nbsp;hours. At its peak intensity, the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma was about {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} in diameter, the smallest known eye of a tropical cyclone.<ref name=\"tcr\"/> In Mexico, [[Isla Mujeres]] reported 64&nbsp;inches (1,625.6&nbsp;mm) of rainfall\u2014five times what [[Hurricane Gilbert]] dropped. This set a 24-hour rainfall record for the country of Mexico, and was the highest point total for rainfall from a tropical cyclone since [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998. Wilma is also the costliest hurricane in Mexican history.\n\nWilma was the first retired \"W\" name since the World Meteorological Organization started retiring names in 1954; it was the strongest Atlantic hurricane to be retired, and when it was retired, it made 2005 the season with the most retired names, with five; the old record was a three-way tie with four names retired in 1955, 1995, and 2004. Wilma was replaced with the name ''Whitney''. Had the unnamed [[2005 Azores subtropical storm]] been operationally recognized, it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October 4 would have been moved one name down the list. Wilma would have consequently been given the name ''Alpha'', in accordance with the convention to name tropical cyclones after the Greek alphabet if the scheduled list of names runs out.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bob King |publisher=Palm Beach Post |date=April 11, 2006 |accessdate=October 10, 2011 |title=Wilma should've been Alpha |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/storm/content/shared-blogs/palmbeach/storm/entries/2006/04/wilma_should_ha.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004218/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/storm/content/shared-blogs/palmbeach/storm/entries/2006/04/wilma_should_ha.html |archivedate=June 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"AOML_FAQ\">{{cite web|author=Neal Dorst|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|date=May 8, 2007|accessdate=October 10, 2011|title=What happens if they run out of names on the list?|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B6.html}}</ref> Had Wilma been named Alpha, it could not have been retired, as the World Meteorological Association determined that it \"was not practical to 'retire into hurricane history' a letter in the Greek Alphabet.\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|date=March 30 \u2013 April 4, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2016|title=RA IV Hurricane Committee Twenty-Eighth Session: Final Report|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/FINAL-REPORT-HC-28.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Tropical cyclone|Mexico|United States|Florida}}\n* [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes]]\n* [[List of Cuba hurricanes]]\n* [[List of Florida hurricanes (2000\u2013present)]]\n* [[List of natural disasters in Haiti]]\n* [[List of wettest tropical cyclones]]\n* [[Timeline of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]\n* [[Hurricane Irma]]\n* [[Typhoon Forrest (1983)]]\n* [[Typhoon Hagibis (2019)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<small>\n<!-- Dead note \"185fcn\": [http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/usworld/news-article.aspx?storyid=48357 First Coast News: photograph of NHC giant wall map showing Wilma at {{convert|185|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}] -->\n<!-- Dead note \"wfor-0120-23\": [http://cbs4.com/topstories/topstoriesmia_story_295075217.html Wilma's Rain Bands cause Flooding in Broward] -->\n<!-- Dead note \"crystal\": [http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-wilma.pg,0,7074860.photogallery?index=37 Sun-Sentinel photograph of damage at the Kathleen C.

Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. Steered by two [[ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] to its north, the depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, with warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg), as measured by the [[Hurricane Hunters]]; this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. The hurricane's [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] shrank to as small as {{convert|2.3|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cyclone.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n[[File:Huricane Wilma.ogg|right|thumb|Satellite video of Wilma's lifespan]]\nAn [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). Abuot six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]]. The hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===Cayman Islands and Central America===\n\n[[file:WilmaPeakFloater.gif|right|thumb|Animation of Hurricane Wilma at peak intensity, then undergoes an [[eyewall replacement cycle]] on October 19.]]\nThe [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) issued many [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches]] throughout Wilma's duration.

It was replaced by Whitney in [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season|2011]].<ref>\"[http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2607.htm Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma \"Retired\" from List of Storm Names].\" ''[[NOAA]].'' March 25, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Records and naming==\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe storm was named \"Wilma,\" the first time the 'W' name was used in the Atlantic Basin, since alphabetical naming began in 1950. With Wilma, the 2005 hurricane season broke the record for most storms in a season, previously held by the [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933 season]]. Moving slowly over warm water with little [[wind shear]], Wilma strengthened steadily and became a hurricane on October 18. The thirteenth hurricane of the season, Wilma broke the record set in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]] for most storms of hurricane strength in one season for the Atlantic Basin.\n\nThe [[barometric pressure]] measured in Wilma, {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, is currently the lowest recorded pressure for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin, as well as the second-lowest pressure for any cyclone measured in the Western Hemisphere, only after [[Hurricane Patricia]] ten years later in the Eastern Pacific. It also reached its {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} pressure in a span of 24&nbsp;hours, making it the fastest pressure drop of any storm in the Atlantic Basin, although [[Hurricane Felix]] of 2007 reached a greater windspeed rise in 51&nbsp;hours. At its peak intensity, the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma was about {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} in diameter, the smallest known eye of a tropical cyclone.<ref name=\"tcr\"/> In Mexico, [[Isla Mujeres]] reported 64&nbsp;inches (1,625.6&nbsp;mm) of rainfall\u2014five times what [[Hurricane Gilbert]] dropped. This set a 24-hour rainfall record for the country of Mexico, and was the highest point total for rainfall from a tropical cyclone since [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998. Wilma is also the costliest hurricane in Mexican history.\n\nWilma was the first retired \"W\" name since the World Meteorological Organization started retiring names in 1954; it was the strongest Atlantic hurricane to be retired, and when it was retired, it made 2005 the season with the most retired names, with five; the old record was a three-way tie with four names retired in 1955, 1995, and 2004. Wilma was replaced with the name ''Whitney''. Had the unnamed [[2005 Azores subtropical storm]] been operationally recognized, it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October 4 would have been moved one name down the list. Wilma would have consequently been given the name ''Alpha'', in accordance with the convention to name tropical cyclones after the Greek alphabet if the scheduled list of names runs out.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bob King |publisher=Palm Beach Post |date=April 11, 2006 |accessdate=October 10, 2011 |title=Wilma should've been Alpha |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/storm/content/shared-blogs/palmbeach/storm/entries/2006/04/wilma_should_ha.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004218/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/storm/content/shared-blogs/palmbeach/storm/entries/2006/04/wilma_should_ha.html |archivedate=June 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"AOML_FAQ\">{{cite web|author=Neal Dorst|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|date=May 8, 2007|accessdate=October 10, 2011|title=What happens if they run out of names on the list?|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B6.html}}</ref> Had Wilma been named Alpha, it could not have been retired, as the World Meteorological Association determined that it \"was not practical to 'retire into hurricane history' a letter in the Greek Alphabet.\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|date=March 30 \u2013 April 4, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2016|title=RA IV Hurricane Committee Twenty-Eighth Session: Final Report|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/FINAL-REPORT-HC-28.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Tropical cyclone|Mexico|United States|Florida}}\n* [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes]]\n* [[List of Cuba hurricanes]]\n* [[List of Florida hurricanes (2000\u2013present)]]\n* [[List of natural disasters in Haiti]]\n* [[List of wettest tropical cyclones]]\n* [[Timeline of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]\n* [[Hurricane Irma]]\n* [[Typhoon Forrest (1983)]]\n* [[Typhoon Hagibis (2019)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<small>\n<!-- Dead note \"185fcn\": [http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/usworld/news-article.aspx?storyid=48357 First Coast News: photograph of NHC giant wall map showing Wilma at {{convert|185|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}] -->\n<!-- Dead note \"wfor-0120-23\": [http://cbs4.com/topstories/topstoriesmia_story_295075217.html Wilma's Rain Bands cause Flooding in Broward] -->\n<!-- Dead note \"crystal\": [http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-wilma.pg,0,7074860.photogallery?index=37 Sun-Sentinel photograph of damage at the Kathleen C.

This accounts for the common name that both father and son share. Another tradition states that before he was born, his father fell ill, and dreamed that he would recover in the merit of the son that would be born to him. In the merit of his future son, the father took his name-to-be.<ref>\"M'Gedolei HaTorah V'HaChassidus\" (Bromberg) vol. 12 pg. 10</ref>.

According to one tradition, his father, Rabbi [[Yaakov Moshe Lorberbaum|Yaakov Moshe]], died before he was born, and his relative, Rabbi Yosef Teomim, the rabbi of Bursztyn, brought him up. This accounts for the common name that both father and son share. Another tradition states that before he was born, his father fell ill, and dreamed that he would recover in the merit of the son that would be born to him. In the merit of his future son, the father took his name-to-be.<ref>\"M'Gedolei HaTorah V'HaChassidus\" (Bromberg) vol. 12 pg. 10</ref>. Yet another legend told, is that at his naming ceremony his father was preoccupied with his learning and thought they asked for his own name. He studied under Rabbi [[Meshulam Igra]].<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\n\nHe was head of the ''[[Beth din|Beis Din]]'' in [[Kalush, Ukraine]].<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> In 1809, he agreed to become the Rav in [[Leszno|Lissa]] (today known as Leszno, Poland), where he enlarged his [[Yeshiva]]'s enrollment. Hundreds of scholars came to study there in the years of his leadership. Among his students were Rabbi [[Elijah Gutmacher]], Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]], and [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Rabbi Shraga Feivel Danziger]].\n\nAlong with Rabbi [[Akiva Eiger]] and Rabbi Eiger's son-in-law, the [[Moses Sofer|Chasam Sofer]], Rabbi Lorberbaum vehemently fought against the [[maskilim]], the reformers of the [[haskalah|Jewish Enlightenment]]. In 1822, he left Lissa and returned to Kalish, where he wrote many of his works.

Meanwhile, two bank robbers are escorting two hostages, Sylvia and her child back from a local diner to her home. A busboy from the diner returns a toy the child left behind, notices the two men, and engages them diffusing the situation by killing one of the men and chasing away the other. Before Sylvia can dial 911 the busboy dissapears. Danny finds Steve at John's, Steve's fathers, grave. Steve reveals to Danny that the letter Doris left is only a [[cipher]], confiding in Danny how much things have changed in the ten-years since his father died, that he doesn't plan on solving the cipher because he doesn't need another mystery in his life.\n\nFive-0 begins looking for the two men along with the mysterious busboy who is found to be living under an assumed identity of a person who's been dead for three years. Adam searches the busboy's hotel room and finds DNA which matches to Lincoln Cole, a former marine who went [[Desertion#United_States|AWOL]]. McGarrett and Junior go to see Lee Phillips, a former [[Commanding Officer]] of Cole's. They find Cole and take him into custody. The brother of the man Cole killed takes Sylvia and her child hostage again and orders Five-0 to give Cole up or he will kill Sylvia and her child. [[United States Military Police|Military Police]] arrive to take Cole into their custody for going AWOL, with no other options McGarrett releases Cole into their custody. While in transport, Cole manages to break free. Cole exchanges himself for Sylvia and her child, the man's brother is about to shoot Cole but Five-0, who suspected Cole's next move, engages him and his men in a gun battle saving everyone.\n\nMcGarrett arranges for Cole's charges to be dropped. In McGarrett's office Cole notices the cipher and offers to reach out to his contacts to have it solved and McGarrett takes him up on the offer. Danny, concerned about McGarrett's [[mental health]] reaches out to him; McGarrett talks about needing a break in the near future. In McGarrett's house Danny finds a burglar going through McGarrett's stuff.
