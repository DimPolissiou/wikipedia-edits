The church was a meeting place of [[Francis Asbury|Asbury]] and [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Coke]].]]\nThe '''history of Methodism in the United States''' dates back to the mid-18th century with the ministries of early [[Methodism|Methodist]] preachers such as [[Laurence Coughlan]] and [[Robert Strawbridge]]. Following the [[American Revolution]] most of the Anglican clergy who had been in America came back to England. [[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism, sent [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] to America where he and [[Francis Asbury]] founded the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], which was to later establish itself as the largest denomination in America during the 19th century.\n\nMethodism thrived in America thanks to the [[First Great Awakening|First]] and [[Second Great Awakening]]s beginning in the 1700s. Various African-American denominations were formed during this period, including the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, many of the splintered Methodist groups joined together to form [[The Methodist Church (USA)]]. Another merger in 1968 resulted in the formation of [[United Methodist Church|The United Methodist Church]] from the [[Evangelical United Brethren]] (EUB) and the Methodist Church. \n\nOther smaller Methodist denominations in the United States, including those that split from the Methodist Episcopal Church, exist, such as the [[Free Methodist Church]], [[Evangelical Methodist Church]], [[Congregational Methodist Church]], [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and [[Bible Methodist Connection of Churches]], among others.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Further|Methodism#Origins}}\nIn 1735, the Wesley brothers, [[John Wesley|John]] and [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], went to the [[Georgia Colony]] to minister to the colonialists and teach the Gospel to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. John Wesley returned to England and met with a group of [[Moravian Church]] clergymen he respected. He said, \"they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity\". The Wesley ministers retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, apprehended through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:\n\n# People are all, by nature, \"dead in sin,\" and, consequently, \"children of wrath.\"\n# They are \"justified by faith alone.\"\n# Faith produces inward and outward holiness.\n\nVery quickly, these clergymen became popular, attracting large congregations. The nickname students had used against the Wesleys was revived; they and their followers became known as ''Methodists''.<ref>Wesley, John. ''A Short History of Methodism.''

Heritage.nf.ca. Retrieved on 2011-12-11.</ref> In the late 1760s, two Methodist lay preachers emigrated to America and formed societies. [[Philip Embury]] began the work in New York at the instigation of fellow Irish Methodist [[Barbara Heck]]. Soon, Captain Webb from the British Army aided him. He formed a society in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and traveled along the coast.\n\nIn 1770, two authorized Methodist preachers, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmoor, arrived from the British Connexion. They were immediately preceded by the unauthorized Robert Williams who quietly set about supporting himself by publishing American editions of Wesley's hymnbooks without obtaining permission to do so. These men were soon followed by others, including [[Francis Asbury]]. Asbury reorganized the mid-Atlantic work in accordance with the Wesleyan model. Internal conflict characterized this period. Missionaries displaced most of the local preachers and irritated many of the leading lay members. During the American Revolution, \"the mid-Atlantic work\" (as Wesley called it) diminished, and, by 1778, the work was reduced to one circuit. Asbury refused to leave. He remained in [[Delaware]] during this period.\n\n[[Robert Strawbridge]] began a Methodist work in [[Maryland]] at the same time as Embury began his work in New York. They did not work together and did not know of each other's existence. Strawbridge ordained himself and organized a circuit. He trained many very influential assistants who became some of the first leaders of American Methodism. His work grew rapidly both in numbers and in geographical spread. The British missionaries discovered Strawbridge's work and annexed it into the American connection. However, the native preachers continued to work side by side with the missionaries, and they continued to recruit and dispatch more native preachers. Southern Methodism was not dependent on missionaries in the same way as mid-Atlantic Methodism.\n\n[[Image:BpThomasCoke.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]], the first Methodist bishop]]\nUp until this time, with the exception of Strawbridge, none of the missionaries or American preachers was ordained. Consequently, the Methodist people received the sacraments at the hands of ministers from established Anglican churches. Most of the Anglican priests were Loyalists who fled to England, New York or Canada during the war. In the absence of Anglican ordination, a group of native preachers ordained themselves. This caused a split between the Asbury faction and the southern preachers. Asbury mediated the crisis by convincing the southern preachers to wait for Wesley's response to the sacramental crisis. That response came in 1784.\n\n[[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism, came to believe that the New Testament evidence did not leave the power of ordination to the priesthood in the hands of [[bishops]] but that other priests could do ordination. In 1784, he ordained preachers for Scotland and England and America, with power to administer the sacraments (this was a major reason for Methodism's final split from the Church of England after Wesley's death). At that time, Wesley sent the [[Thomas Coke (Bishop)|Rev. Dr. Thomas Coke]] to America to form an independent American Methodist church. The native circuit riders met in late December. Coke had orders to ordain Asbury as a joint superintendent of the new church. However, Asbury turned to the assembled conference and said he would not accept it unless the preachers voted him into that office. This was done, and from that moment forward, the general superintendents received their authority from the conference. Later, Coke convinced the general conference that he and Asbury were bishops and added the title to the discipline. It caused a great deal of controversy. Wesley did not approve of 'bishops' who had not been ordained by bishops. The first annual conference of the newly organized Methodist Episcopal Church was held at [[Green Hill House]] near [[Louisburg, North Carolina|Louisburg]], [[Franklin County, North Carolina]], April 19, 1785.  Four annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church were held at the house of Green Hill and Hill was their host.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web |author1=John Baxton Flowers, III |author2=Catherine W.

Ultimately, the delegates sided with Bishop Asbury. However, the [[Christian Connection|Republican Methodists]] split off from the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (MEC) in 1792. Also, William Hammet (a missionary ordained by Wesley who traveled to America from Antigua with Bishop Coke), led a successful revolt against the MEC in 1791. He opposed Bishop Asbury and the episcopacy. He formed his people into the American Primitive Methodist Church (not directly connected with the British Primitive Methodist Church). Both American churches operated in the Southeast and presaged the episcopal debates of later reformers. Regardless, Asbury remained the leading bishop of early American Methodism and did not share his \"appointing\" authority until Bishop McKendree was elected in 1808. Coke had problems with the American preachers. His authoritarian style alienated many. Soon, he became a missionary bishop of sorts and never had much influence in America.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell E. Richey|author2=Kenneth E.

The English Calvinist Methodist preacher [[George Whitefield]] played a major role, traveling up and down the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style, accepting everyone as his audience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard G.

People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious matters and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation.\n\nThe first American Methodist bishops were [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]], whose boyhood home, ''[[Bishop Asbury Cottage]]'', in [[West Bromwich]], England, is now a museum. Upon the formation of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in America at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] [[Christmas Conference (Methodism)|Christmas Conference]] in 1784, Coke (already ordained in the Church of England) ordained Asbury a [[deacon]], [[elder (Methodism)|elder]], and bishop each on three successive days. [[Circuit rider (religious)|Circuit riders]], many of whom were laymen, traveled by horseback to preach the gospel and establish churches until there was scarcely any crossroad community in America without a Methodist expression of Christianity. One of the most famous circuit riders was [[Robert Strawbridge]] who lived in the vicinity of [[Carroll County, Maryland]] soon after arriving in the Colonies around 1760.<ref>Frederick E. Maser, ''Robert Strawbridge: First American Methodist Circuit Rider'' (Rutland, Vt.: Academy Books, 1983), 11\u201325</ref>\n\n[[File:Growth of Denominations in America 1780 to 1860.jpg|thumb|left|the number of local Methodist churches (blue) grew rapidly in all parts of the country; it was the largest denomination by 1820.<ref>Data from Edwin Scott Gaustad, ''Historical Atlas of Religion in America'' (2nd ed. 1976) pp 4,4</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] was a nationwide wave of revivals, from 1790 to 1840. In [[New England]], the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism among Yankees; Methodism grew rapidly and established several colleges, notably [[Boston University]]. In the \"burned over district\" of western New York, the spirit of revival burned brightly. Methodism saw the emergence of a [[Holiness movement]]. In the west, especially at [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky]] and in Tennessee, the revival strengthened the Methodists and the [[Baptists]]. The Methodists appealed especially to the urban middle class.<ref>Richard Carwardine, \"The Second Great Awakening in the Urban Centers: An Examination of Methodism and the New Measures',\" ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 59#2 pp: 327-340. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1890193 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Civil War and Reconstruction==\nDisputes over slavery placed the church in difficulty in the first half of the 19th century, with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the South, and reluctant to take a stand. The [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Connexion]] (later became The Wesleyan Church) and the [[Free Methodist]] Churches were formed by staunch abolitionists, and the Free Methodists were especially active in the [[Underground Railroad]], which helped to free the slaves. Finally, in a much larger split, in 1845 at Louisville, the churches of the slaveholding states left the Methodist Episcopal Church and formed The [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]. The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939, when slavery was no longer an issue. In this merger also joined the [[Methodist Protestant Church]]. Some southerners, conservative in theology, and strongly segregationist, opposed the merger, and formed the [[Southern Methodist Church]] in 1940.\n\nMany Northerners had only recently become religious and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Carwardine argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the terror unleashed on godly abolitionists, release from the [[Slave Power]]'s evil grip on the state, and a new direction for the Union.<ref>Richard Carwardine, \"Methodists, Politics, and the Coming of the American Civil War,\" ''Church History,'' September 2000, Vol. 69 Issue 3, pp 578-609 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3169398 in JSTOR]</ref> Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the [[Radical Republicans]] with their hard line toward the white South.

Endres, \"A Voice for the Christian Family: The Methodist Episcopal 'Ladies' Repository' in the Civil War,\" ''Methodist History,'' January 1995, Vol. 33 Issue 2, pp 84-97</ref>\n\nDuring [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen, and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control, with Army help, of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church.<ref>William W. Sweet, \"Methodist Church Influence in Southern Politics,\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review,'' Vol. 1, No. 4 (Mar., 1915), pp. 546-560 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1886955 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Ralph E.

Luccock]], Paul Hutchinson, and Robert W. Goodloe, ''The Story of Methodism'' (1926)</ref> This organization, along with the church's Department of Education for Negroes of the Board of Education, helped provide education to former slaves and their children. Within three months of its organization, the Freedmen's Aid Society had begun work in the South. By the end of the first year, the society had more than fifty teachers.\n\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] from 1858 to 1908 saw enormous growth in Methodist membership, and a proliferation of institutions such as colleges (e.g., [[Morningside College]]). Methodists were often involved in the ''Missionary Awakening'' and the [[Social Gospel]] Movement. The awakening in so many cities in 1858 started the movement, but in the North it was interrupted by the Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals, especially in Lee's army.\n\n==Modern history==\n[[File:Meeting of the West Michigan Conference of The United Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=|Meeting of the West Michigan Conference of [[The United Methodist Church]].]]\nIn 1914\u20131917 many Methodist ministers made strong pleas for world peace. To meet their demands,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (a Presbyterian), promised \"a war to end all wars.\" In the 1930s many Methodists favored isolationist policies. Thus in 1936, Methodist Bishop James Baker, of the San Francisco Conference, released a poll of ministers showing 56% opposed warfare. However, the Methodist Federation did call for a boycott of Japan, which had invaded China and was disrupting missionary activity there.<ref>[Meyer 200, 354]</ref> In Chicago, sixty-two local African Methodist Episcopal churches voted their support for the Roosevelt administration's policy, while opposing any plan to send American troops overseas to fight. When war came in 1941, the vast majority of Methodists strongly supported the national war effort, but there were also a few (673<ref>Methodist World Peace Commission administered [[Civilian Public Service]] units at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina and Cherokee State (Psychiatric) Hospital in Cherokee, Iowa ([http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/CPScampsList.htm list of CPS Camps]).</ref>) [[conscientious objectors]].\n\nThe [[United Methodist Church]] was formed in 1968 as a result of a merger between the [[Evangelical United Brethren]] (EUB) and [[The Methodist Church (USA)]]. The former church had resulted from mergers of several groups of German Methodist heritage. There was no longer any need or desire to worship in the German language. The merged church had approximately 9 million members as of the late 1990s. While United Methodist Church in America membership has been declining, associated groups in developing countries are growing rapidly.<ref>[http://www.methodistreview.org/index.php/mr/article/view/48 World Growth of the United Methodist Church in Comparative Perspective: A Brief Statistical Analysis | Robert]. Methodist Review. Retrieved on 2011-12-11.</ref>\n\nAmerican Methodist churches are generally organized on a ''connectional'' model, related but not identical to that used in Britain. Pastors are assigned to congregations by bishops, distinguishing it from [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] government. Methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national meetings (conferences) at which the business of the church is conducted, making it different from most [[Episcopal polity|episcopal government]] (The Episcopal Church USA, however, has a representational polity giving lay members, priests, and bishops voting privileges). This connectional organizational model differs further from the [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] model, for example of [[Baptist]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalist Churches]], among others.\n\n[[File:Richard Allen crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bishop [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], the founder of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]].]]\nIn addition to the United Methodist Church, there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley's Methodist movement. Some, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church|AME Zion Church]],<ref>''The Doctrines and Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, with an Appendix; Revised by the General Conference, Atlanta, Georgia 16\u201322 July 2008''.

The [[Evangelical Church of North America|Evangelical Church]] was formed by a group of EUB congregations who dissented from the merger which formed the United Methodist Church. The [[United Methodist Church]] has also taken steps to strengthen ties with its fellow Methodist churches, as well as other Protestant denominations in the United States. Since 1985, the UMC has been exploring a possible [[church union|merger]] with three [[Black church|historically African-American]] Methodist [[Christian denominations|denominations]]: the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], and the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]].<ref name=\"UMC-Quick Facts\">{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=6&mid=2119| title = Quick Facts|publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 1 August 2007}}</ref> A ''Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union'' formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger.<ref name=\"Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation & Union\">{{cite web|url = http://www.panmethodist.org/panmeth/mission.htm|title = Mission|publisher = Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation & Union|accessdate = 1 August 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135215/http://www.panmethodist.org/panmeth/mission.htm|archive-date = 28 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|300px|Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church is a parish church of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and is located in [[Akron, Ohio]].]]\nThe holiness revival was primarily among people of Methodist persuasion,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} who felt that the church had once again become apathetic, losing the Wesleyan zeal. Some important events of this revival were the writings of [[Phoebe Palmer]] during the mid-19th century, the establishment of the first of many holiness [[camp meeting]]s at [[Vineland, New Jersey]] in 1867, and the founding of [[Asbury University|Asbury College]] (1890), and other similar institutions in the US around the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Allegheny Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church entered into a schism with the rest of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, a Methodist denomination in the holiness movement, because it favored a [[Connexionalism|connexional polity]] and opposed the merger of the Wesleyan Methodist Church with the [[Pilgrim Holiness Church]]; while the rest of the Wesleyan Methodist Church became the [[Wesleyan Church]], the Allegheny Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church became the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], which today, is one of the largest denominations in the [[conservative holiness movement]].<ref name=\"KurianDay2017\">{{cite book|last1=Kurian|first1=George Thomas|last2=Day|first2=Sarah Claudine|title=The Essential Handbook of Denominations and Ministries|date=14 March 2017|publisher=Baker Publishing Group|language=English|isbn=9781493406401|page=318}}</ref> \n\nFrom its beginning in England, Methodism laid emphasis on social service and education. Numerous originally Methodist institutions of higher education were founded in the United States in the early half of the 19th century, and today altogether there are about twenty universities and colleges named as \"Methodist\" or \"Wesleyan\" still in existence.\n\nAdditionally, the Methodist Church has created a number of [[Wesley Foundation]] establishments on college campuses. These ministries are created to reach out to students, and often provide student housing to a few students in exchange for service to the ministry.\n\nUnited Methodist elders and pastors may marry and have families. They are placed in congregations by their bishop. Elders and pastors can either ask for a new appointment or their church can request that they be re-appointed elsewhere. If the elder is a full-time pastor, the church is required to provide either a house or a housing allowance for the pastor.\n\nWhereas most American Methodist worship is modeled after the [[Anglican Communion]]'s Book of Common Prayer, a unique feature was the once practiced observance of the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which encompasses the last thirteen weeks before [[Advent]], thus dividing the long season after [[Pentecost]] into two discrete segments. During Kingdomtide, Methodist liturgy emphasizes charitable work and alleviating the suffering of the poor. This practice was last seen in ''The Book of Worship for Church and Home'' by The United Methodist Church, 1965, and ''The Book of Hymns'', 1966. While some congregations and their pastors might still follow this old calendar, the Revised Common Lectionary, with its naming and numbering of Days in the Calendar of the Church Year, is used widely. However, congregations who strongly identify with their African American roots and tradition would not usually follow the Revised Common Lectionary.\n\nAdding more complexity to the mix, there are United Methodist congregations who orient their worship to the \"free\" church tradition, so particular liturgies are not observed. ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'' and ''The Hymns of the United Methodist Church'' are voluntarily followed in varying degrees. Such churches employ the liturgy and rituals therein as optional resources, but their use is not mandatory.\n\n==Social principles and participation in movements==\nFrom the movement's beginnings, with its roots in [[Wesleyan]] theology, Methodism has distinguished itself as a religious movement strongly tied to social issues. As father of the movement, [[John Wesley]] injected much of his own social philosophy into the movement as a whole. Wesley's personal social philosophy was characterized by \"an instructive reluctance to criticize existing institutions [which] was overborne by indignation at certain abuses which cried out for rectification.\"<ref name=Society>Camerona, Richard M. Methodism and Society. Vol. 1\u20133. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1961. Print.</ref> The Methodist Church's responses to injustices in society are embodiments of the Wesleyan traditions of mercy and justice.\n\nAt the end of the 19th- and beginning of the 20th-centuries, the Methodist Church responded strongly to what it regarded as social ills (e.g., gambling, use of intoxicating beverages, etc.) with attention to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection through Christ. In the United States, today's [[United Methodist Church]] continues to embody Methodist traditions in their response to social needs through the [[General Board of Church and Society]] and the General Board of Global Ministries.\n\nIn the United States, the United Methodist Church is the second-largest sponsor of [[Boy Scout]] units, with 11078 chartered units, representing over 370,000 youth members; by way of contrast, the [[LDS Church]], which sponsors a total of 37,882 units - over three times as many - can boast a total youth membership of slightly over 420,000, only a 13.5% increase over the UMC's total.<ref>Boy Scouts of America http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125642/http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs.aspx |date=2016-02-01 }}</ref>\n\n===Rejection of LGBT marriages and clergy===\n\"Methodists stand almost alone among [[Mainline_Protestant|mainline]] denominations in not performing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]s, in contrast to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], and the [[United Church of Christ]].\"<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Reeling from contentious LGBT vote, some Methodists pledge to fight while others mull leaving\n|first1=Julie\n|last1=Zauzmer\n|first2=Sarah Pulliam\n|last2=Bailey\n|date=February 28, 2019\n|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]\n|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/religion/2019/02/27/reeling-contentious-lgbt-vote-some-methodists-pledge-fight-while-others-mull-leaving/}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Methodist Church]] delegates met in St. Louis February 26, 2019, and voted 438 to 384 to maintain its policies barring [[LGBTQ]] \u2014 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer \u2014 marriage and clergy in the church.

Both sides of the argument used the doctrines of the movement and scriptural evidence to support their case.\n\nThe initial statement of the Methodist position on slavery was delivered in the Conference minutes from 1780's annual conference. After a comprehensive statement of the varied reasons slavery goes against \"the laws of God, man, and nature,\" the Conference answered in the affirmative to the question, \"do we pass our disapprobation on all our friends who keep slaves and advise their freedom?\"<ref name=\"Society\"/> This position was put into action in 1783. Preachers from the Baltimore Conference were required, under threat of suspension, to free their slaves.<ref name=\"Society\"/> By 1784, similar requirements were made of Methodists as a whole, laity and clergy alike. The negative reaction to this requirement was so strong that it had to be abandoned, but the rule was kept in the [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]].\n\nAs slavery disputes intensified in the 19th century, there emerged two doctrines within the Methodist Church. Churches in the South were primarily proslavery, while northern churches started [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] movements. The [[apologia]] of the Southern churches was largely based in [[Old Testament]] scriptures, which often represent slavery as a part of the natural order of things.<ref name=\"Society\"/> [[New Testament]] writings were sometimes used to support the case for slavery as well. Some of the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], especially in [[Ephesians]], instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters. Southern ideology also argued that slavery was beneficial for slaves, as well as their owners, saying that they were offered protections from many ills because of their slavery.<ref name=\"Society\"/>\nThe antislavery movement in northern churches strengthened and solidified in response to the pro-slavery apologia of Southern churches.\n\n===Education of young people===\n[[File:Sunday school class in Community (Methodist) Church. Inland Steel Company, Wheelwright ^1 & 2 Mines, Wheelwright... - NARA - 541439.jpg|thumb|Sunday school at a Methodist church in [[Kentucky]], 1946]]\nThe Methodist church has always been strongly oriented towards the religious lives of the young. In 1848, the General Conference stated, \"when the Church has collected...a great population born within [her] bosom, she cannot fulfill her high mission unless she takes measure to prevent this population from being withdrawn from under her care in the period of its youth.\"<ref name=\"Society\"/> The first two American bishops of the Methodist Church, [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and Francis Asbury, opened a preparatory school in [[Abingdon, Maryland]] in 1787.<ref name=\"Society\"/> The school was a strict environment, with seven hours a day devoted to study. The venture ended when a fire destroyed the building in which the school was housed.\n\nIn the 1870s, there was a broad movement toward incorporating Sunday schools into the doctrines of churches as a way to take ownership of the Christian education of children. This was the first great [[interdenominational]] movement the United States had ever seen. Methodists invested heavily in the cause of Christian education because of their emphasis on the child's right to and ability to \"respond to divine influences from the beginning.\"<ref name=\"Story\"/>\n\nBeginning after World War II, the Methodist churches in the United States continued developing, at a much greater pace, ministries on Universities, Colleges, Junior Colleges and other higher education institutions, on campuses of both church-owned and state schools throughout the United States and Canada, and to a lesser degree in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methodism boasts the largest number of higher education ministries, including teaching positions, of any Protestant denomination in the world in close competition with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. This emphasis is, in part, a reflection of the Methodist movement's earliest roots in [[Holy Club|The Oxford Holy Club]], founded by [[John Wesley]], his brother Charles, [[George Whitefield]] and others as a response to what they saw as the pervasive permissiveness and debauchery of Oxford University, and specifically [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] when they attended. It is from the Holy Club that the earliest Methodist societies were formed and spread.<ref name=\"Story\"/><ref>United Methodist Board of Higher Education Ministries www.gbhem.org</ref>\n\n===Temperance movement===\nThe [[temperance movement]] was the social concern which most broadly captured the interest and enthusiasm of the Methodist Church. The movement was strongly tied to John Wesley's theology and social principles. Wesley's abhorrence of alcohol use was taken up by American Methodists, many of whom were active and prominent leaders within the movement.\n\nThe temperance movement appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of [[sanctification]] and [[Christian perfection]]. The Methodist presentation of sanctification includes the understanding that justification before God comes through faith. Therefore, those who believe are made new in Christ. The believer's response to this sanctification then is to uphold God's word in the world. A large part of this, especially in the late-19th century, was \"to be their brother's keepers, or [...] their brother's brothers.\"<ref name=\"History\">Agnew, Theodore L. The History of American Methodism: in three volumes. Volumes 1\u20133. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1964. Print.</ref> Because of this sense of duty toward the other members of the church, many Methodists were personally temperate out of a hope that their restraint would give strength to their brothers. The Methodist stance against drinking was strongly stated in the Book of Discipline. Initially, the issue taken was limited to distilled liquors, but quickly evolved into [[teetotalism]] and Methodists were commonly known to abstain from all alcoholic beverages.<ref name=\"Society\"/>\n\nIn 1880, the general conference included in the Discipline a broad statement which included, \"Temperance is a Christian virtue, Scripturally enjoined.\"<ref name=\"History\"/> Due to the temperate stance of the church, the practice of [[Eucharist]] was altered \u2014 to this day, Methodist churches most commonly use grape juice symbolically during [[Eucharist|Communion]] rather than wine. The Methodist church distinguished itself from many other denominations in their beliefs about state control of alcohol. Where many other denominations, including Roman Catholics, Protestant Episcopalians, [[Lutherans]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], believed that the ill-effects of liquor should be controlled by self-discipline and individual restraint, Methodists believed that it was the duty of the government to enforce restrictions on the use of alcohol.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 1904, the Board of Temperance was created by the General Conference to help push the Temperance agenda.\n\nThe women of the Methodist Church were strongly mobilized by the temperance movement. In 1879, a Methodist woman, [[Frances E. Willard]], was voted to the presidency of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], an organization that was founded in December 1873, and was characterized by heavy Methodist participation. To this day, the Women's Division of the General Board of Global Missions holds property on [[Capitol Hill]] in Washington, DC, which was built using funds provided by laypeople. Women of the church were responsible for 70% of the $650,000 it cost to construct the building in 1922. The building was intended to serve as the Methodist Church's social reform presence of the Hill. The Board of Temperance, Prohibition and Public Morals was especially prominent within the building.<ref>\"The United Methodist Building.\" General Board of Church and Society.

The church was a meeting place of [[Francis Asbury|Asbury]] and [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Coke]].]]\nThe '''history of Methodism in the United States''' dates back to the mid-18th century with the ministries of early [[Methodism|Methodist]] preachers such as [[Laurence Coughlan]] and [[Robert Strawbridge]]. Following the [[American Revolution]] most of the Anglican clergy who had been in America came back to England. [[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism, sent [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] to America where he and [[Francis Asbury]] founded the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], which was to later establish itself as the largest denomination in America during the 19th century.\n\nMethodism thrived in America thanks to the [[First Great Awakening|First]] and [[Second Great Awakening]]s beginning in the 1700s. Various African-American denominations were formed during this period, including the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, many of the splintered Methodist groups joined together to form [[The Methodist Church (USA)]]. Another merger in 1968 resulted in the formation of [[United Methodist Church|The United Methodist Church]] from the [[Evangelical United Brethren]] (EUB) and the Methodist Church. \n\nOther smaller Methodist denominations in the United States, including those that split from the Methodist Episcopal Church, exist, such as the [[Free Methodist Church]], [[Evangelical Methodist Church]], [[Congregational Methodist Church]], [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and [[Bible Methodist Connection of Churches]], among others.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Further|Methodism#Origins}}\nIn 1735, the Wesley brothers, [[John Wesley|John]] and [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], went to the [[Georgia Colony]] to minister to the colonialists and teach the Gospel to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. John Wesley returned to England and met with a group of [[Moravian Church]] clergymen he respected. He said, \"they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible-Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity\". The Wesley ministers retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, apprehended through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:\n\n# People are all, by nature, \"dead in sin,\" and, consequently, \"children of wrath.\"\n# They are \"justified by faith alone.\"\n# Faith produces inward and outward holiness.\n\nVery quickly, these clergymen became popular, attracting large congregations. The nickname students had used against the Wesleys was revived; they and their followers became known as ''Methodists''.<ref>Wesley, John. ''A Short History of Methodism.''

Heritage.nf.ca. Retrieved on 2011-12-11.</ref> In the late 1760s, two Methodist lay preachers emigrated to America and formed societies. [[Philip Embury]] began the work in New York at the instigation of fellow Irish Methodist [[Barbara Heck]]. Soon, Captain Webb from the British Army aided him. He formed a society in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and traveled along the coast.\n\nIn 1770, two authorized Methodist preachers, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmoor, arrived from the British Connexion. They were immediately preceded by the unauthorized Robert Williams who quietly set about supporting himself by publishing American editions of Wesley's hymnbooks without obtaining permission to do so. These men were soon followed by others, including [[Francis Asbury]]. Asbury reorganized the mid-Atlantic work in accordance with the Wesleyan model. Internal conflict characterized this period. Missionaries displaced most of the local preachers and irritated many of the leading lay members. During the American Revolution, \"the mid-Atlantic work\" (as Wesley called it) diminished, and, by 1778, the work was reduced to one circuit. Asbury refused to leave. He remained in [[Delaware]] during this period.\n\n[[Robert Strawbridge]] began a Methodist work in [[Maryland]] at the same time as Embury began his work in New York. They did not work together and did not know of each other's existence. Strawbridge ordained himself and organized a circuit. He trained many very influential assistants who became some of the first leaders of American Methodism. His work grew rapidly both in numbers and in geographical spread. The British missionaries discovered Strawbridge's work and annexed it into the American connection. However, the native preachers continued to work side-by-side with the missionaries, and they continued to recruit and dispatch more native preachers. Southern Methodism was not dependent on missionaries in the same way as mid-Atlantic Methodism.\n\n[[Image:BpThomasCoke.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]], the first Methodist bishop]]\nUp until this time, with the exception of Strawbridge, none of the missionaries or American preachers was ordained. Consequently, the Methodist people received the sacraments at the hands of ministers from established Anglican churches. Most of the Anglican priests were Loyalists who fled to England, New York or Canada during the war. In the absence of Anglican ordination, a group of native preachers ordained themselves. This caused a split between the Asbury faction and the southern preachers. Asbury mediated the crisis by convincing the southern preachers to wait for Wesley's response to the sacramental crisis. That response came in 1784.\n\n[[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism, came to believe that the New Testament evidence did not leave the power of ordination to the priesthood in the hands of [[bishops]] but that other priests could do ordination. In 1784, he ordained preachers for Scotland and England and America, with power to administer the sacraments (this was a major reason for Methodism's final split from the Church of England after Wesley's death). At that time, Wesley sent the [[Thomas Coke (Bishop)|Rev. Dr. Thomas Coke]] to America to form an independent American Methodist church. The native circuit riders met in late December. Coke had orders to ordain Asbury as a joint superintendent of the new church. However, Asbury turned to the assembled conference and said he would not accept it unless the preachers voted him into that office. This was done, and from that moment forward, the general superintendents received their authority from the conference. Later, Coke convinced the general conference that he and Asbury were bishops and added the title to the discipline. It caused a great deal of controversy. Wesley did not approve of 'bishops' who had not been ordained by bishops. The first annual conference of the newly organized Methodist Episcopal Church was held at [[Green Hill House]] near [[Louisburg, North Carolina|Louisburg]], [[Franklin County, North Carolina]], April 19, 1785.  Four annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church were held at the house of Green Hill and Hill was their host.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web |author1=John Baxton Flowers, III |author2=Catherine W.

Ultimately, the delegates sided with Bishop Asbury. However, the [[Christian Connection|Republican Methodists]] split off from the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (MEC) in 1792. Also, William Hammet (a missionary ordained by Wesley who traveled to America from Antigua with Bishop Coke), led a successful revolt against the MEC in 1791. He opposed Bishop Asbury and the episcopacy. He formed his people into the American Primitive Methodist Church (not directly connected with the British Primitive Methodist Church). Both American churches operated in the Southeast and presaged the episcopal debates of later reformers. Regardless, Asbury remained the leading bishop of early American Methodism and did not share his \"appointing\" authority until Bishop McKendree was elected in 1808. Coke had problems with the American preachers. His authoritarian style alienated many. Soon, he became a missionary bishop of sorts and never had much influence in America.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Russell E. Richey|author2=Kenneth E.

The English Calvinist Methodist preacher [[George Whitefield]] played a major role, traveling up and down the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style, accepting everyone as his audience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard G.

People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious matters and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation.\n\nThe first American Methodist bishops were [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]], whose boyhood home, ''[[Bishop Asbury Cottage]]'', in [[West Bromwich]], England, is now a museum. Upon the formation of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in America at the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] [[Christmas Conference (Methodism)|Christmas Conference]] in 1784, Coke (already ordained in the Church of England) ordained Asbury a [[deacon]], [[elder (Methodism)|elder]], and bishop each on three successive days. [[Circuit rider (religious)|Circuit riders]], many of whom were laymen, traveled by horseback to preach the gospel and establish churches until there was scarcely any crossroad community in America without a Methodist expression of Christianity. One of the most famous circuit riders was [[Robert Strawbridge]] who lived in the vicinity of [[Carroll County, Maryland]] soon after arriving in the Colonies around 1760.<ref>Frederick E. Maser, ''Robert Strawbridge: First American Methodist Circuit Rider'' (Rutland, Vt.: Academy Books, 1983), 11\u201325</ref>\n\n[[File:Growth of Denominations in America 1780 to 1860.jpg|thumb|left|the number of local Methodist churches (blue) grew rapidly in all parts of the country; it was the largest denomination by 1820.<ref>Data from Edwin Scott Gaustad, ''Historical Atlas of Religion in America'' (2nd ed. 1976) pp 4,4</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Second Great Awakening]] was a nationwide wave of revivals, from 1790 to 1840. In [[New England]], the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism among Yankees; Methodism grew rapidly and established several colleges, notably [[Boston University]]. In the \"burned over district\" of western New York, the spirit of revival burned brightly. Methodism saw the emergence of a [[Holiness movement]]. In the west, especially at [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky]] and in Tennessee, the revival strengthened the Methodists and the [[Baptists]]. The Methodists appealed especially to the urban middle class.<ref>Richard Carwardine, \"The Second Great Awakening in the Urban Centers: An Examination of Methodism and the New Measures',\" ''Journal of American History'' (1972) 59#2 pp: 327-340. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1890193 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Civil War and Reconstruction==\nDisputes over slavery placed the church in difficulty in the first half of the 19th century, with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the South, and reluctant to take a stand. The [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Connexion]] (later became The Wesleyan Church) and the [[Free Methodist]] Churches were formed by staunch abolitionists, and the Free Methodists were especially active in the [[Underground Railroad]], which helped to free the slaves. Finally, in a much larger split, in 1845 at Louisville, the churches of the slaveholding states left the Methodist Episcopal Church and formed The [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]. The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939, when slavery was no longer an issue. In this merger also joined the [[Methodist Protestant Church]]. Some southerners, conservative in theology, and strongly segregationist, opposed the merger, and formed the [[Southern Methodist Church]] in 1940.\n\nMany Northerners had only recently become religious and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Carwardine argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America.

Within three months of its organization, the Freedmen's Aid Society had begun work in the South. By the end of the first year, the society had more than fifty teachers.\n\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] from 1858 to 1908 saw enormous growth in Methodist membership, and a proliferation of institutions such as colleges (e.g., [[Morningside College]]). Methodists were often involved in the ''Missionary Awakening'' and the [[Social Gospel]] Movement. The awakening in so many cities in 1858 started the movement, but in the North it was interrupted by the Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals, especially in Lee's army.\n\n==Modern history==\n[[File:Meeting of the West Michigan Conference of The United Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=|Meeting of the West Michigan Conference of [[The United Methodist Church]].]]\nIn 1914\u20131917 many Methodist ministers made strong pleas for world peace. To meet their demands,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (a Presbyterian), promised \"a war to end all wars.\" In the 1930s many Methodists favored isolationist policies. Thus in 1936, Methodist Bishop James Baker, of the San Francisco Conference, released a poll of ministers showing 56% opposed warfare. However, the Methodist Federation did call for a boycott of Japan, which had invaded China and was disrupting missionary activity there.<ref>[Meyer 200, 354]</ref> In Chicago, sixty-two local African Methodist Episcopal churches voted their support for the Roosevelt administration's policy, while opposing any plan to send American troops overseas to fight.

The former church had resulted from mergers of several groups of German Methodist heritage. There was no longer any need or desire to worship in the German language. The merged church had approximately 9 million members as of the late 1990s. While United Methodist Church in America membership has been declining, associated groups in developing countries are growing rapidly.<ref>[http://www.methodistreview.org/index.php/mr/article/view/48 World Growth of the United Methodist Church in Comparative Perspective: A Brief Statistical Analysis | Robert]. Methodist Review. Retrieved on 2011-12-11.</ref>\n\nAmerican Methodist churches are generally organized on a ''connectional'' model, related but not identical to that used in Britain. Pastors are assigned to congregations by bishops, distinguishing it from [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] government. Methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national meetings (conferences) at which the business of the church is conducted, making it different from most [[Episcopal polity|episcopal government]] (The Episcopal Church USA, however, has a representational polity giving lay members, priests, and bishops voting privileges). This connectional organizational model differs further from the [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] model, for example of [[Baptist]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalist Churches]], among others.\n\n[[File:Richard Allen crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bishop [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], the founder of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]].]]\nIn addition to the United Methodist Church, there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley's Methodist movement. Some, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church|AME Zion Church]],<ref>''The Doctrines and Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, with an Appendix; Revised by the General Conference, Atlanta, Georgia 16\u201322 July 2008''.

The [[Evangelical Church of North America|Evangelical Church]] was formed by a group of EUB congregations who dissented from the merger which formed the United Methodist Church. The [[United Methodist Church]] has also taken steps to strengthen ties with its fellow Methodist churches, as well as other Protestant denominations in the United States. Since 1985, the UMC has been exploring a possible [[church union|merger]] with three [[Black church|historically African-American]] Methodist [[Christian denominations|denominations]]: the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], and the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]].<ref name=\"UMC-Quick Facts\">{{cite web|url = http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=6&mid=2119| title = Quick Facts|publisher = The United Methodist Church|accessdate = 1 August 2007}}</ref> A ''Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union'' formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger.<ref name=\"Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation & Union\">{{cite web|url = http://www.panmethodist.org/panmeth/mission.htm|title = Mission|publisher = Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation & Union|accessdate = 1 August 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135215/http://www.panmethodist.org/panmeth/mission.htm|archive-date = 28 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|300px|Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church is a parish church of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and is located in [[Akron, Ohio]].]]\nThe holiness revival was primarily among people of Methodist persuasion,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} who felt that the church had once again become apathetic, losing the Wesleyan zeal. Some important events of this revival were the writings of [[Phoebe Palmer]] during the mid-19th century, the establishment of the first of many holiness [[camp meeting]]s at [[Vineland, New Jersey]] in 1867, and the founding of [[Asbury University|Asbury College]] (1890), and other similar institutions in the US around the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The Allegheny Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church entered into a schism with the rest of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, a Methodist denomination in the holiness movement, because it favored a [[Connexionalism|connexional polity]] and opposed the merger of the Wesleyan Methodist Church with the [[Pilgrim Holiness Church]]; while the rest of the Wesleyan Methodist Church became the [[Wesleyan Church]], the Allegheny Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church became the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], which today, is one of the largest denominations in the [[conservative holiness movement]].<ref name=\"KurianDay2017\">{{cite book|last1=Kurian|first1=George Thomas|last2=Day|first2=Sarah Claudine|title=The Essential Handbook of Denominations and Ministries|date=14 March 2017|publisher=Baker Publishing Group|language=English|isbn=9781493406401|page=318}}</ref> \n\nFrom its beginning in England, Methodism laid emphasis on social service and education. Numerous originally Methodist institutions of higher education were founded in the United States in the early half of the 19th century, and today altogether there are about twenty universities and colleges named as \"Methodist\" or \"Wesleyan\" still in existence.\n\nAdditionally, the Methodist Church has created a number of [[Wesley Foundation]] establishments on college campuses. These ministries are created to reach out to students, and often provide student housing to a few students in exchange for service to the ministry.\n\nUnited Methodist elders and pastors may marry and have families. They are placed in congregations by their bishop. Elders and pastors can either ask for a new appointment or their church can request that they be re-appointed elsewhere. If the elder is a full-time pastor, the church is required to provide either a house or a housing allowance for the pastor.\n\nWhereas most American Methodist worship is modeled after the [[Anglican Communion]]'s Book of Common Prayer, a unique feature was the once practiced observance of the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which encompasses the last thirteen weeks before [[Advent]], thus dividing the long season after [[Pentecost]] into two discrete segments. During Kingdomtide, Methodist liturgy emphasizes charitable work and alleviating the suffering of the poor. This practice was last seen in ''The Book of Worship for Church and Home'' by The United Methodist Church, 1965, and ''The Book of Hymns'', 1966. While some congregations and their pastors might still follow this old calendar, the Revised Common Lectionary, with its naming and numbering of Days in the Calendar of the Church Year, is used widely. However, congregations who strongly identify with their African American roots and tradition would not usually follow the Revised Common Lectionary.\n\nAdding more complexity to the mix, there are United Methodist congregations who orient their worship to the \"free\" church tradition, so particular liturgies are not observed. ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'' and ''The Hymns of the United Methodist Church'' are voluntarily followed in varying degrees. Such churches employ the liturgy and rituals therein as optional resources, but their use is not mandatory.\n\n==Social principles and participation in movements==\nFrom the movement's beginnings, with its roots in [[Wesleyan]] theology, Methodism has distinguished itself as a religious movement strongly tied to social issues. As father of the movement, [[John Wesley]] injected much of his own social philosophy into the movement as a whole. Wesley's personal social philosophy was characterized by \"an instructive reluctance to criticize existing institutions [which] was overborne by indignation at certain abuses which cried out for rectification.\"<ref name=Society>Camerona, Richard M. Methodism and Society. Vol. 1\u20133. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1961. Print.</ref> The Methodist Church's responses to injustices in society are embodiments of the Wesleyan traditions of mercy and justice.\n\nAt the end of the 19th- and beginning of the 20th-centuries, the Methodist Church responded strongly to what it regarded as social ills (e.g., gambling, use of intoxicating beverages, etc.) with attention to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection through Christ. In the United States, today's [[United Methodist Church]] continues to embody Methodist traditions in their response to social needs through the [[General Board of Church and Society]] and the General Board of Global Ministries.\n\nIn the United States, the United Methodist Church is the second-largest sponsor of [[Boy Scout]] units, with 11078 chartered units, representing over 370,000 youth members; by way of contrast, the [[LDS Church]], which sponsors a total of 37,882 units - over three times as many - can boast a total youth membership of slightly over 420,000, only a 13.5% increase over the UMC's total.<ref>Boy Scouts of America http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125642/http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs.aspx |date=2016-02-01 }}</ref>\n\n===Rejection of LGBT marriages and clergy===\n\"Methodists stand almost alone among [[Mainline_Protestant|mainline]] denominations in not performing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]s, in contrast to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], and the [[United Church of Christ]].\"<ref>{{cite news\n|title=Reeling from contentious LGBT vote, some Methodists pledge to fight while others mull leaving\n|first1=Julie\n|last1=Zauzmer\n|first2=Sarah Pulliam\n|last2=Bailey\n|date=February 28, 2019\n|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]\n|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/religion/2019/02/27/reeling-contentious-lgbt-vote-some-methodists-pledge-fight-while-others-mull-leaving/}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Methodist Church]] delegates met in St. Louis February 26, 2019, and voted 438 to 384 to maintain its policies barring [[LGBTQ]] \u2014 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer \u2014 marriage and clergy in the church.

Both sides of the argument used the doctrines of the movement and scriptural evidence to support their case.\n\nThe initial statement of the Methodist position on slavery was delivered in the Conference minutes from 1780's annual conference. After a comprehensive statement of the varied reasons slavery goes against \"the laws of God, man, and nature,\" the Conference answered in the affirmative to the question, \"do we pass our disapprobation on all our friends who keep slaves and advise their freedom?\"<ref name=\"Society\"/> This position was put into action in 1783. Preachers from the Baltimore Conference were required, under threat of suspension, to free their slaves.<ref name=\"Society\"/> By 1784, similar requirements were made of Methodists as a whole, laity and clergy alike. The negative reaction to this requirement was so strong that it had to be abandoned, but the rule was kept in the [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]].\n\nAs slavery disputes intensified in the 19th century, there emerged two doctrines within the Methodist Church. Churches in the South were primarily proslavery, while northern churches started [[abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] movements. The [[apologia]] of the Southern churches was largely based in [[Old Testament]] scriptures, which often represent slavery as a part of the natural order of things.<ref name=\"Society\"/> [[New Testament]] writings were sometimes used to support the case for slavery as well. Some of the writings of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], especially in [[Ephesians]], instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters. Southern ideology also argued that slavery was beneficial for slaves, as well as their owners, saying that they were offered protections from many ills because of their slavery.<ref name=\"Society\"/>\nThe antislavery movement in northern churches strengthened and solidified in response to the pro-slavery apologia of Southern churches.\n\n===Education of young people===\n[[File:Sunday school class in Community (Methodist) Church. Inland Steel Company, Wheelwright ^1 & 2 Mines, Wheelwright... - NARA - 541439.jpg|thumb|Sunday school at a Methodist church in [[Kentucky]], 1946]]\nThe Methodist church has always been strongly oriented towards the religious lives of the young. In 1848, the General Conference stated, \"when the Church has collected...a great population born within [her] bosom, she cannot fulfill her high mission unless she takes measure to prevent this population from being withdrawn from under her care in the period of its youth.\"<ref name=\"Society\"/> The first two American bishops of the Methodist Church, [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and Francis Asbury, opened a preparatory school in [[Abingdon, Maryland]] in 1787.<ref name=\"Society\"/> The school was a strict environment, with seven hours a day devoted to study. The venture ended when a fire destroyed the building in which the school was housed.\n\nIn the 1870s, there was a broad movement toward incorporating Sunday schools into the doctrines of churches as a way to take ownership of the Christian education of children. This was the first great [[interdenominational]] movement the United States had ever seen. Methodists invested heavily in the cause of Christian education because of their emphasis on the child's right to and ability to \"respond to divine influences from the beginning.\"<ref name=\"Story\"/>\n\nBeginning after World War II, the Methodist churches in the United States continued developing, at a much greater pace, ministries on Universities, Colleges, Junior Colleges and other higher education institutions, on campuses of both church-owned and state schools throughout the United States and Canada, and to a lesser degree in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methodism boasts the largest number of higher education ministries, including teaching positions, of any Protestant denomination in the world in close competition with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. This emphasis is, in part, a reflection of the Methodist movement's earliest roots in [[Holy Club|The Oxford Holy Club]], founded by [[John Wesley]], his brother Charles, [[George Whitefield]] and others as a response to what they saw as the pervasive permissiveness and debauchery of Oxford University, and specifically [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] when they attended. It is from the Holy Club that the earliest Methodist societies were formed and spread.<ref name=\"Story\"/><ref>United Methodist Board of Higher Education Ministries www.gbhem.org</ref>\n\n===Temperance movement===\nThe [[temperance movement]] was the social concern which most broadly captured the interest and enthusiasm of the Methodist Church. The movement was strongly tied to John Wesley's theology and social principles. Wesley's abhorrence of alcohol use was taken up by American Methodists, many of whom were active and prominent leaders within the movement.\n\nThe temperance movement appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of [[sanctification]] and [[Christian perfection]]. The Methodist presentation of sanctification includes the understanding that justification before God comes through faith. Therefore, those who believe are made new in Christ. The believer's response to this sanctification then is to uphold God's word in the world. A large part of this, especially in the late-19th century, was \"to be their brother's keepers, or [...] their brother's brothers.\"<ref name=\"History\">Agnew, Theodore L. The History of American Methodism: in three volumes. Volumes 1\u20133. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1964. Print.</ref> Because of this sense of duty toward the other members of the church, many Methodists were personally temperate out of a hope that their restraint would give strength to their brothers. The Methodist stance against drinking was strongly stated in the Book of Discipline. Initially, the issue taken was limited to distilled liquors, but quickly evolved into [[teetotalism]] and Methodists were commonly known to abstain from all alcoholic beverages.<ref name=\"Society\"/>\n\nIn 1880, the general conference included in the Discipline a broad statement which included, \"Temperance is a Christian virtue, Scripturally enjoined.\"<ref name=\"History\"/> Due to the temperate stance of the church, the practice of [[Eucharist]] was altered \u2014 to this day, Methodist churches most commonly use grape juice symbolically during [[Eucharist|Communion]] rather than wine. The Methodist church distinguished itself from many other denominations in their beliefs about state control of alcohol. Where many other denominations, including Roman Catholics, Protestant Episcopalians, [[Lutherans]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], believed that the ill-effects of liquor should be controlled by self-discipline and individual restraint, Methodists believed that it was the duty of the government to enforce restrictions on the use of alcohol.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 1904, the Board of Temperance was created by the General Conference to help push the Temperance agenda.\n\nThe women of the Methodist Church were strongly mobilized by the temperance movement. In 1879, a Methodist woman, [[Frances E. Willard]], was voted to the presidency of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], an organization that was founded in December 1873, and was characterized by heavy Methodist participation. To this day, the Women's Division of the General Board of Global Missions holds property on [[Capitol Hill]] in Washington, DC, which was built using funds provided by laypeople. Women of the church were responsible for 70% of the $650,000 it cost to construct the building in 1922. The building was intended to serve as the Methodist Church's social reform presence of the Hill. The Board of Temperance, Prohibition and Public Morals was especially prominent within the building.<ref>\"The United Methodist Building.\" General Board of Church and Society.

An exception exists for Viscounts in the peerage of Scotland, who were traditionally styled \"The Viscount ''of'' [X]\", such as the [[Viscount of Arbuthnott]]. In practice, however, very few maintain this style, instead using the more common version \"The Viscount [X]\" in general parlance, for example [[Viscount of Falkland]] who is referred to as Viscount Falkland.\n\nA British viscount is addressed in speech as ''Lord [X]'', while his wife is ''Lady [X]'', and he is formally styled \"[[The Right Honourable]] The Viscount [X]\". The children of a viscount are known as ''[[The Honourable]] [Forename] [Surname]''.<ref name=\"Debretts: Viscount and Viscountess\">{{cite web|title=Viscount and Viscountess|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/viscount-and-viscountess|date=n.d.|accessdate=18 June 2014|publisher=[[Debretts]]}}</ref>\n====Ireland====\nThe title of viscount ({{Lang-ga|b\u00edocunta}}) was introduced to the [[Peerage of Ireland]] in 1478 with the creation of the title of [[Viscount Gormanston]], the senior viscountcy of Britain and Ireland, held today by [[Jenico Preston, 17th Viscount Gormanston]]. Other early Irish viscountcies were [[Viscount Baltinglass]] (1541), [[John Rawson, 1st Viscount Clontarf| Viscount Clontarf]] (1541), [[Viscount Mountgarret]] (1550) and [[Viscount Decies]] (1569).\n====Use as a courtesy title====\nA specifically British custom is the use of viscount as a [[courtesy title]] for the heir of an earl or marquess. The peer's [[heir apparent]] will sometimes be referred to as a viscount, if the second most senior title held by the head of the family is a viscountcy. For example, the eldest son of the [[Earl Howe]] is [[Viscount Curzon]], because this is the second most senior title held by the Earl.<ref name=\"Debretts: Courtesy Titles\">{{cite web|title=Courtesy Titles|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/courtesy-titles|date=n.d.|publisher=[[Debretts]]|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the son of a marquess or an earl can be referred to as a viscount when the title of viscount is not the second most senior if those above it share their name with the [[substantive title]]. For example, the second most senior title of the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] is the [[Earl of Salisbury]], so his heir uses the lower title of [[Viscount Cranborne]].\n\nSometimes the son of a peer can be referred to as a viscount even when he could use a more senior courtesy title which differs in name from the substantive title. Family tradition plays a role in this. For example, the eldest son of the [[Marquess of Londonderry]] is Viscount Castlereagh, even though the Marquess is also the Earl Vane.\n\nOn occasion, the title of viscount may be the courtesy title used for the grandson of a duke, provided that he is the eldest son of the duke's eldest son.  This is because the eldest son of the duke will be given the second highest title of his father (marquess or earl), and so the third-highest is left for his eldest son.  It is possible for the great-grandson of a duke to hold the courtesy title of viscount if the duke's eldest son has the courtesy title marquess and his eldest son, in turn, uses the title of earl.\n\n====Coronet====\n[[File:Coronet of a British Viscount.svg|right|thumb|150px|[[Coronet]] of a British viscount.]]\n[[File:Coronet of a British Viscount.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Coronet]] of the 6th [[Viscount Clifden]].]]\nA viscount's [[coronet]] of rank bears 16 silver balls around the rim. Like all heraldic coronets, it is mostly worn at the [[coronation]] of a sovereign, but a viscount has the right to bear his coronet of rank on his [[coat of arms]], above the shield. In this guise, the coronet is shown face-on, featuring 9 silver balls.<ref name=\"Debretts:Ceremonial Robes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/ceremonial-robes|publisher=[[Debretts]]|date=n.d.|accessdate=18 June 2014|title=Ceremonial Robes}}</ref>\n\n===Jersey===\nThe island of [[Jersey]] still retains an officer whose function is purely to administer orders of the island's judiciary, and whose position remains non-hereditary. The role of the [[Viscount of Jersey]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Vicomte de Jersey'') involves managing fines, bail monies, seizures, confiscations, evictions, service of process, arrests for non-appearance in court and other enforcement procedures, as well acting as [[coroner]] for sudden or unexpected deaths and managing [[jury selection]].<ref name=\"Function of the Viscount's department\">{{cite web|title=Functions of the Viscount's Department|publisher=States of Jersey|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/Viscount/Pages/Functions.aspx|date=n.d.|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Portugal===\nIn the former kingdom of [[Portugal]] a ''visconde'' ranks above a ''bar\u00e3o'' (baron) and below a ''conde'' (count). The first Portuguese viscountcy, that of D. Leonel de Lima, visconde de Vila Nova de Cerveira, dates from the reign of [[Alfonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]. A flood of viscountcies, some 86 new titles, were awarded in Portugal between 1848 and 1880.\n\n===Spain===\nThe Spanish title of ''vizconde'' is ranked between the title ''conde'' (count/earl) and the relatively rare title of ''bar\u00f3n''.\n\nIn Spain, nobles are classified as either Grandee of Spain (Grandes de Espa\u00f1a), as titled nobles, or as untitled nobles. A grandee of any rank outranks a non-grandee, even if that non-grandee's title is of a higher degree, thus, a viscount-grandee enjoys higher precedence than a marquis who is not a grandee.\n\nIn the kingdom of Spain the title was awarded from the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain|Felipe IV]] (1621\u201365; Habsburg dynasty) until 1846.\n\n==Equivalent titles==\n\n===Germanic counterparts===\nThere are non-etymological equivalents to the title of viscount (''i.e.'', 'vice-count') in several languages, including German.\n\nHowever, in such case titles of the etymological [[Burgrave]] family (not in countries with a viscount-form, such as Italian ''burgravio'' alongside ''visconte'') bearers of the title could establish themselves at the same gap, thus at generally the same level. Consequently, a ''Freiherr'' (or Baron) ranks not immediately below a ''Graf'', but below a ''Burggraf''.\n\nThus in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Burggraaf'' is the rank above Baron, below Graaf (''i.e.'', Count) in the kingdoms of the Netherlands and of Belgium (by Belgian law, its equivalents in the other official languages are ''Burggraf'' in [[German language|German]] and ''vicomte'' in [[French language|French]]). In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the title is rendered as [[Welsh Peers|''Isiarll'']].\n\n===Non-Western counterparts===\nLike other major Western noble titles, viscount is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-western languages with their own traditions. Even though they are considered 'equivalent' in relative rank, they are as a rule historically unrelated and thus hard to compare.\n\nThe Japanese cognate ''shishaku'' (''shi'') ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|\u5b50\u7235}}) was the fourth of the five peerage ranks established in the [[Meiji era]]. The Japanese system of nobility, [[Kazoku]], which existed between 1884 and 1947 was based heavily on the British peerage. At the creation of the system, viscounts were the most numerous of all the ranks, with 324 being created compared to 11 non-imperial princes or dukes, 24 marquesses, 76 counts and 74 barons, for a total of 509 peers.<ref>Jansen, ''The Making of Modern Japan'', p. 391.</ref>\n\nOther equivalent titles existed, such as:\n* the Chinese ''tzu-chueh'' (''tzu'') or ''zijue'' (''zi'') ({{zh|c=\u5b50\u7235}}), hereditary title of nobility first established in the [[Zhou dynasty]]\n* the Korean cognate ''jajak'' or Pans\u014f\n* the Vietnamese cognate T\u1eed\n* the Manchu ''jingkini hafan''\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Viscountcies|List of British Viscountcies]]\n*[[List of Viscountcies in Portugal]]\n* Several Italian noble dynasties\n** [[Visconti of Milan]], ruled Milan from 1277 to 1447\n*** [[Visconti di Modrone]], collateral branch of the Visconti of Milan\n** [[Visconti of Pisa and Sardinia]], ruled Gallura in Sardinia from 1207 to 1250\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Terms for types of country subdivisions}}\n\n[[Category:Viscounts| ]]\n[[Category:Viscountcies| ]]\n[[Category:Men's social titles]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n[[Category:Peerage]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Royal and noble ranks}}\n\nA '''viscount''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-viscount.ogg|\u02c8|v|a\u026a|k|a\u028a|n|t}} {{respell|VY|kownt}}, for male<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/viscount?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Viscount|date=n.d.|publisher=[[Collins Dictionary]]|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>) or '''viscountess''' ({{IPAc-en|'|v|a\u026a|k|a\u028a|n|t|\u026a|s}}, for female<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/viscountess?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Viscountess|date=n.d.|publisher=[[Collins Dictionary]]|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>) is a [[Title#Aristocratic titles|title]] used in certain [[Europe]]an countries for a [[nobility|noble]] of varying status.\n\nIn many countries a viscount, and its historical equivalents, was a non-hereditary, administrative or [[judiciary|judicial]] position{{When|date=January 2020}}, and did not develop into an [[hereditary title]] until much later{{When|date=January 2020}}.<ref name=\"Upshur, Terry, Holoka, Goff & Cassar\" /> In the case of French viscounts, it is customary to leave the title untranslated as '''vicomte''' {{IPA-fr|vi.k\u0254\u0303t|}}.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''viscount'' comes from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|visconte}} ([[French language|Modern French]]: {{lang|fr|vicomte}}), itself from [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|vicecomitem}}, [[accusative case|accusative]] of {{lang|la|vicecomes}}, from [[Vulgar Latin|Late Latin]] {{lang|la|vice-}} \"deputy\" + [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[comes]]}} (originally \"companion\"; later Roman imperial courtier or trusted appointee, ultimately count).<ref name=\"Online Etymology\">{{cite dictionary |title=Viscount (n.) |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=18 June 2014 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=viscount }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Carolingian Empire]], the kings appointed [[count]]s to administer [[Government of the Carolingian Empire#subdivision|provinces]] and other smaller regions, as [[governors]] and military commanders.

The peer's [[heir apparent]] will sometimes be referred to as a viscount, if the second most senior title held by the head of the family is a viscountcy. For example, the eldest son of the [[Earl Howe]] is [[Viscount Curzon]], because this is the second most senior title held by the Earl.<ref name=\"Debretts: Courtesy Titles\">{{cite web|title=Courtesy Titles|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/courtesy-titles|date=n.d.|publisher=[[Debretts]]|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the son of a marquess or an earl can be referred to as a viscount when the title of viscount is not the second most senior if those above it share their name with the [[substantive title]]. For example, the second most senior title of the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] is the [[Earl of Salisbury]], so his heir uses the lower title of [[Viscount Cranborne]].\n\nSometimes the son of a peer can be referred to as a viscount even when he could use a more senior courtesy title which differs in name from the substantive title. Family tradition plays a role in this. For example, the eldest son of the [[Marquess of Londonderry]] is Viscount Castlereagh, even though the Marquess is also the Earl Vane.\n\nOn occasion, the title of viscount may be the courtesy title used for the grandson of a duke, provided that he is the eldest son of the duke's eldest son.  This is because the eldest son of the duke will be given the second highest title of his father (marquess or earl), and so the third-highest is left for his eldest son.  It is possible for the great-grandson of a duke to hold the courtesy title of viscount if the duke's eldest son has the courtesy title marquess and his eldest son, in turn, uses the title of earl.\n\n====Coronet====\n[[File:Coronet of a British Viscount.svg|right|thumb|150px|[[Coronet]] of a British viscount.]]\n[[File:Coronet of a British Viscount.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Coronet]] of the 6th [[Viscount Clifden]].]]\nA viscount's [[coronet]] of rank bears 16 silver balls around the rim. Like all heraldic coronets, it is mostly worn at the [[coronation]] of a sovereign, but a viscount has the right to bear his coronet of rank on his [[coat of arms]], above the shield. In this guise, the coronet is shown face-on, featuring 9 silver balls.<ref name=\"Debretts:Ceremonial Robes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/essential-guide-peerage/ceremonial-robes|publisher=[[Debretts]]|date=n.d.|accessdate=18 June 2014|title=Ceremonial Robes}}</ref>\n\n===Jersey===\nThe island of [[Jersey]] still retains an officer whose function is purely to administer orders of the island's judiciary, and whose position remains non-hereditary. The role of the [[Viscount of Jersey]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Vicomte de Jersey'') involves managing fines, bail monies, seizures, confiscations, evictions, service of process, arrests for non-appearance in court and other enforcement procedures, as well acting as [[coroner]] for sudden or unexpected deaths and managing [[jury selection]].<ref name=\"Function of the Viscount's department\">{{cite web|title=Functions of the Viscount's Department|publisher=States of Jersey|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/Viscount/Pages/Functions.aspx|date=n.d.|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Portugal===\nIn the former kingdom of [[Portugal]] a ''visconde'' ranks above a ''bar\u00e3o'' (baron) and below a ''conde'' (count). The first Portuguese viscountcy, that of D. Leonel de Lima, visconde de Vila Nova de Cerveira, dates from the reign of [[Alfonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]. A flood of viscountcies, some 86 new titles, were awarded in Portugal between 1848 and 1880.\n\n===Spain===\nThe Spanish title of ''vizconde'' is ranked between the title ''conde'' (count/earl) and the relatively rare title of ''bar\u00f3n''.\n\nIn Spain, nobles are classified as either Grandee of Spain (Grandes de Espa\u00f1a), as titled nobles, or as untitled nobles. A grandee of any rank outranks a non-grandee, even if that non-grandee's title is of a higher degree, thus, a viscount-grandee enjoys higher precedence than a marquis who is not a grandee.\n\nIn the kingdom of Spain the title was awarded from the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain|Felipe IV]] (1621\u201365; Habsburg dynasty) until 1846.\n\n==Equivalent titles==\n\n===Germanic counterparts===\nThere are non-etymological equivalents to the title of viscount (''i.e.'', 'vice-count') in several languages, including German.\n\nHowever, in such case titles of the etymological [[Burgrave]] family (not in countries with a viscount-form, such as Italian ''burgravio'' alongside ''visconte'') bearers of the title could establish themselves at the same gap, thus at generally the same level. Consequently, a ''Freiherr'' (or Baron) ranks not immediately below a ''Graf'', but below a ''Burggraf''.\n\nThus in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Burggraaf'' is the rank above Baron, below Graaf (''i.e.'', Count) in the kingdoms of the Netherlands and of Belgium (by Belgian law, its equivalents in the other official languages are ''Burggraf'' in [[German language|German]] and ''vicomte'' in [[French language|French]]). In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the title is rendered as [[Welsh Peers|''Isiarll'']].\n\n===Non-Western counterparts===\nLike other major Western noble titles, viscount is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-western languages with their own traditions. Even though they are considered 'equivalent' in relative rank, they are as a rule historically unrelated and thus hard to compare.\n\nThe Japanese cognate ''shishaku'' (''shi'') ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|\u5b50\u7235}}) was the fourth of the five peerage ranks established in the [[Meiji era]]. The Japanese system of nobility, [[Kazoku]], which existed between 1884 and 1947 was based heavily on the British peerage. At the creation of the system, viscounts were the most numerous of all the ranks, with 324 being created compared to 11 non-imperial princes or dukes, 24 marquesses, 76 counts and 74 barons, for a total of 509 peers.<ref>Jansen, ''The Making of Modern Japan'', p. 391.</ref>\n\nOther equivalent titles existed, such as:\n* the Chinese ''tzu-chueh'' (''tzu'') or ''zijue'' (''zi'') ({{zh|c=\u5b50\u7235}}), hereditary title of nobility first established in the [[Zhou dynasty]]\n* the Korean cognate ''jajak'' or [[Pans\u014f]]\n* the Vietnamese cognate [[T\u1eed]]\n* the Manchu ''jingkini hafan''\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Viscountcies|List of British Viscountcies]]\n*[[List of Viscountcies in Portugal]]\n* Several Italian noble dynasties\n** [[Visconti of Milan]], ruled Milan from 1277 to 1447\n*** [[Visconti di Modrone]], collateral branch of the Visconti of Milan\n** [[Visconti of Pisa and Sardinia]], ruled Gallura in Sardinia from 1207 to 1250\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Terms for types of country subdivisions}}\n\n[[Category:Viscounts| ]]\n[[Category:Viscountcies| ]]\n[[Category:Men's social titles]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n[[Category:Peerage]]\n", "name_user": "ViscountVismut", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNon-Western counterparts:Removing broken links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscount"}

He initially made a number of real estate purchases including the Cross estate and the Manse estate, on which he built his famous house Chiromo.<ref>http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Ewart-Grogan-and-origins-of-Chiromo-name/-/539444/1371464/-/iorrb4z/-/index.html</ref> Grogan then began to look for further business opportunities including the potential of developing commercial logging near the Mau summit and for cattle grazing on the Uasin Gishu plateau. In 1907 Grogan was involved in what became publicly known as the \u2018Nairobi Incident\u2019 after his sister Dorothy and her friend alleged to have been shamefully treated by three Kikuyu rickshaw drivers, Grogan took it upon himself to punish the men by walking them into Nairobi and publicly flogging them, Grogan flogged the first man, the two others being flogged by other members of the settler community, amongst them [[William Bowker]]. The event was widely reported around the world often erroneously reporting that one of the Kikuyu men had been killed. In response to this disregard for colonial authority Grogan and the two other men were tried and convicted; Grogan was sentenced to one month\u2019s prison and a Rs500 fine.<ref>''Lost Lion of Empire'', Edward Paice pp 211\u2013223</ref>\n\nGrogan continued to expand his business interests in Kenya both before and after the First World War, as well as completing the railway line to his logging concession. He subsequently sunk a large portion of his wealth into building the first deep water harbour in Mombasa.\n\nHe later built the Torr's Hotel in Nairobi<ref name=\"Ulf\">{{cite book |last1=Aschan |first1=Ulf |title=The Man Whom Women Loved |url=https://archive.org/details/manwhomwomenlove00asch |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=9780312022495 |page=[https://archive.org/details/manwhomwomenlove00asch/page/136 136]}}</ref> and was a proprietor with Lord Delamere of the ''East African Standard'' newspaper. After World War I, Grogan had built significant business interests in Kenya including a ranch at Longonot, the Equator Saw mill, a rice mill and factory in Mwanza, land at Turi, a ranch on the Athi plains and a Kingatori coffee farm. These assets were sold to finance his next project the development of land in Taveta in southern Kenya, where he now spent most of his time. He invested a fortune to successfully irrigate and develop arid scrub into fertile productive land.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War Grogan, who was now aged in his sixties, immediately reported to Nairobi to General Dickinson. He was appointed Belgian liaison officer and carried out reconnaissance across the Congolese border. Later in the war he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and put in charge of three prisoner of war camps in Gilgil and Nairobi. After the war Grogan returned to Taveta, living in \u2018Grogan\u2019s Castle\u2019, the large house he built on a hill overlooking the area. In 1943 Gertrude Grogan died from a heart attack in Nairobi. Grogan, seeking a fitting memorial for his wife, founded the Gertrude\u2019s Garden Children Hospital<ref>[http://www.gerties.org Gertrude\u2019s Garden Children Hospital]</ref> of which there are now seven in present-day Nairobi.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gerties.org/about-us/brief-history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427092212/http://www.gerties.org/about-us/brief-history.html |archive-date=27 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nGrogan was involved in politics all his life in Kenya, serving on the Colonial Association and the legislative council. Grogan took an interest in the advancement and education of the indigenous African population, believing that \u2018the road of advancement must be open to all Africans\u2019 and only then could his vision of a \u2018reasonable and decent society in Africa\u2019 be fulfilled.<ref>Ruminations on Monetary Hysteria, E. S. Grogan, ''East African Star'' Oct-Dec 1945</ref> Grogan had intended his Jipe Estate to be used as an agricultural college for Africans, offering it to the colonial government but never receiving a reply. Grogan kept abreast of politics in the colony during the struggle for independence, lunching on several occasions with [[Tom Mboya]] at the Torrs Hotel and proclaiming him a \u2018very remarkable young African\u2019. <ref>''Star of East Africa'' 22 April 1956</ref> Grogan served on the Legislative Council throughout Kenya\u2019s move to independence. In his later years Grogan lived with companion Camilla Towers at his house in [[Taveta, Kenya]], until his death in South Africa at the age of 92.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2007, American journalist [[Julian Smith (author)|Julian Smith]] retraced Grogan's route from South Africa to southern Sudan, and wrote about it in the book ''Crossing the Heart of Africa'' (2010).<ref>Julian Smith.

He initially made a number of real estate purchases including the Cross estate and the Manse estate, on which he built his famous house Chiromo.<ref>http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Ewart-Grogan-and-origins-of-Chiromo-name/-/539444/1371464/-/iorrb4z/-/index.html</ref> Grogan then began to look for further business opportunities including the potential of developing commercial logging near the Mau summit and for cattle grazing on the Uasin Gishu plateau. In 1907 Grogan was involved in what became publicly known as the \u2018Nairobi Incident\u2019 after his sister Dorothy and her friend alleged to have been shamefully treated by three Kikuyu rickshaw drivers, Grogan took it upon himself to punish the men by walking them into Nairobi and publicly flogging them, Grogan flogged the first man, the two others being flogged by other members of the settler community, amongst them [[William Bowker]]. The event was widely reported around the world often erroneously reporting that one of the Kikuyu men had been killed. In response to this disregard for colonial authority Grogan and the two other men were tried and convicted; Grogan was sentenced to one month\u2019s prison and a Rs500 fine.<ref>''Lost Lion of Empire'', Edward Paice pp 211\u2013223</ref>\n\nGrogan continued to expand his business interests in Kenya both before and after the First World War, as well as completing the railway line to his logging concession. He subsequently sunk a large portion of his wealth into building the first deep water harbour in Mombasa.\n\nHe later built the Torr's Hotel in Nairobi<ref name=\"Ulf\">{{cite book |last1=Aschan |first1=Ulf |title=The Man Whom Women Loved |url=https://archive.org/details/manwhomwomenlove00asch |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=9780312022495 |page=[https://archive.org/details/manwhomwomenlove00asch/page/136 136]}}</ref> and was a proprietor with Lord Delamere of the ''East African Standard'' newspaper. After World War I, Grogan had built significant business interests in Kenya including a ranch at Longonot, the Equator Saw mill, a rice mill and factory in Mwanza, land at Turi, a ranch on the Athi plains and a Kingatori coffee farm. These assets were sold to finance his next project the development of land in Taveta in southern Kenya, where he now spent most of his time. He invested a fortune to successfully irrigate and develop arid scrub into fertile productive land.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War Grogan, who was now aged in his sixties, immediately reported to Nairobi to General Dickinson. He was appointed Belgian liaison officer and carried out reconnaissance across the Congolese border. Later in the war he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and put in charge of three prisoner of war camps in Gilgil and Nairobi. After the war Grogan returned to Taveta, living in \u2018Grogan\u2019s Castle\u2019, the large house he built on a hill overlooking the area. In 1943 Gertrude Grogan died from a heart attack in Nairobi. Grogan, seeking a fitting memorial for his wife, founded the Gertrude\u2019s Garden Children Hospital<ref>[http://www.gerties.org Gertrude\u2019s Garden Children Hospital]</ref> of which there are now seven in present-day Nairobi.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gerties.org/about-us/brief-history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427092212/http://www.gerties.org/about-us/brief-history.html |archive-date=27 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nGrogan was involved in politics all his life in Kenya, serving on the Colonial Association and the legislative council. Grogan took an interest in the advancement and education of the indigenous African population, believing that \u2018the road of advancement must be open to all Africans\u2019 and only then could his vision of a \u2018reasonable and decent society in Africa\u2019 be fulfilled.<ref>Ruminations on Monetary Hysteria, E. S. Grogan, ''East African Star'' Oct-Dec 1945</ref> Grogan had intended his Jipe Estate to be used as an agricultural college for Africans, offering it to the colonial government but never receiving a reply. Grogan kept abreast of politics in the colony during the struggle for independence, lunching on several occasions with [[Tom Mboya]] at the Torrs Hotel and proclaiming him a \u2018very remarkable young African\u2019. <ref>''Star of East Africa'' 22 April 1956</ref> Grogan served on the Legislative Council throughout Kenya\u2019s move to independence. In his later years Grogan lived with companion Camilla Towers at his house in [[Taveta, Kenya]], until his death in South Africa at the age of 92.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2007, American journalist [[Julian Smith (author)|Julian Smith]] retraced Grogan's route from South Africa to southern Sudan, and wrote about it in the book ''Crossing the Heart of Africa'' (2010).<ref>Julian Smith.

Originally [[Proxy marriage|married via proxy]] at [[Notre Dame Cathedral|Notre Dame]] (with the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] standing in for Philip) prior to leaving France,{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}} the actual ceremony took place in [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]], Spain, upon her arrival. The marriage was a result of the [[Peace of Cateau Cambr\u00e9sis]] (1559).{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}} His second wife, [[Mary I of England]], had recently died, making Elisabeth of Valois Philip's third wife.\n\nAt her wedding, she met the famous painter [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] and [[Ana de Mendoza, Princess of Eboli|Ana de Mendoza]], who would live with her the rest of her life.{{sfn|Nader|2003|p=1}} [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] appointed Anguissola to be a lady-in-waiting and court painter for his queen. Under Anguissola's tutelage, Elisabeth improved her amateur painting skills. Anguissola also influenced the artistic works of her children, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] and [[Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain|Caterina Michaela]], during her time at the court.\n\nPhilip was completely enchanted by his 14-year-old bride,{{sfn|Carri\u00f3n|2010|p=74}} and by 1564 had given up his infidelities.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=90}} Despite the significant age difference, Elisabeth was also quite pleased with her husband. (In letters to her mother, she proclaimed herself to be fortunate to have married so charming a prince.) Philip enjoyed hosting [[Chivalry in Spain|chivalric]] tournaments to entertain his wife.  Elisabeth would play liege lady to the three young princes of the Spanish Court: [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], [[John of Austria]] (illegitimate son of Charles V), and [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (son of Charles V's illegitimate daughter Margaret).\n\nElisabeth had originally been betrothed to Philip's son, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], but political complications unexpectedly necessitated instead a marriage to Philip. Her relationship with her troubled stepson Carlos was warm and friendly. Despite reports of his progressively bizarre behavior, Carlos was always kind and gentle to Elisabeth.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=120-121}}  When it eventually became necessary for Philip to lock him away (which shortly led to the Prince's demise), Elisabeth cried for days.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=121}}\n[[File:Felipe&Elisabeth.jpeg|thumb|Coronation of Elisabeth de Valois  as Queen of Spain ]]\nPhilip was very attached to Elisabeth, staying close by her side even when she was ill with [[smallpox]]. Elisabeth's first pregnancy in 1564 ended with a [[miscarriage]] of twin girls. She later gave birth to [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]] on 12 August 1566, and then to Isabella's younger sister [[Catherine Michelle of Spain]] on 10 October 1567. Phillip and Elisabeth were very close to both of their daughters buying them jams, dolls, toys and more. It is said 'both rejoiced at the birth of Isabella as if it had been the birth of a son'.  Elisabeth had another miscarriage on 3 October 1568, and died the same day,{{sfn|Knecht|1988|p=134}} along with her newborn infant daughter.\n\nAfter the death of Elisabeth, [[Catherine de' Medici]] offered her younger daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for Philip.{{sfn|Knecht|1988|p=134}} Philip declined the offer.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=125}}\n\n==In fiction==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Elisabeth of France (1545-1568), Queen Consort of Spain.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of Elisabeth of France, Queen of Spain.]]\n\nElisabeth of Valois is a central character in [[Thomas Otway]]'s play ''Don Carlos'', in [[Schiller]]'s [[Don Carlos (play)|play of the same name]],  in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera adapted from Schiller's play, also titled ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and in [[Don Carlos (play)#Opera adaptations|several other, less well-known operas]]; [[Antonio Buzzolla]]'s version of 1850 is actually named \"Elisabetta di Valois\". All these works imply a tragic romance between Elisabeth and Carlos, suggesting that they were really in love with each other when Elisabeth was forced to break off her engagement to Carlos and marry his father Philip.\n\nIn [[Madame de Lafayette]]'s novella ''The Princesse de Cleves'', Elisabeth of Valois' marriage to Philip II is the occasion for the wedding games at which her father [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] dies; her role is brief but it substantially affects the novella's narrative arc.\n\nElisabeth of Valois is portrayed by Caoimhe O'Malley (in the Pilot) on the CW show, [[Reign (TV series)|Reign]], then later by [[Anastasia Phillips]] in the fourth season of the show. Rather than the \u201cplain Jane\u201d of her family the character is portrayed as beautiful and her timid and shy personality is changed to that of one more forceful, cold, insensitive and quite controlling which is driven out of her legitimate desire for her [[Catherine de' Medici|mother's]] affections. Her name ''Elisabeth'' is spelled with an S instead of a Z though in the fourth season she is simply called ''Leeza'' as not to be confused with [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. In the first episode, Leeza is married to King Philip of Spain, leaves for Spain with her husband without speaking any lines, and isn't physically seen until fourth season of the show. Though not seen until the fourth season, she is mentioned as a possible option for god-mother to her King Francis' (her brother's) son John in the second season. In the third season, her kingdom is chosen as a safe haven for her younger sisters and brothers after a group calling themselves \"The Red Knights\" threaten revenge on the Valois family. Making her physical return to the show, she is one of the four Queens ([[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen Mary]], Queen Elizabeth I and her mother, regent Queen Catherine) to be featured during the season. During her appearance, she spends time in French court as an [[Diplomacy|envoy]] of Spain and voice of her husband's wishes as well rival for her mother.\n\nElisabeth of Valois is a major character in ''The Creation of Eve'', a novel by Lynn Cullen based on the history of [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], the first renowned female artist of the Italian Renaissance. In the novel, Sofonisba is the painting tutor and premier lady-in-waiting for young Queen Elisabeth.\n\n[[File:DianedAndouins1565.jpg|alt=sometimes regareced as DianedAndouins|thumb|Portrait of Elisabeth of valois and Isabella Clara Eugenia ]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |title=Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France |volume=1 |trans-title=Genealogical and chronological history of the royal house of France |last=Anselme de Sainte-Marie |first=P\u00e8re |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76026j/f149.image |publisher=La compagnie des libraires |location=Paris |language=fr |edition=3rd |year=1726 |ref={{harvid|Anselme|1726}} }}\n*{{cite book |title=Henry II, King of France:1547-1559 |last=Baumgartner |first=Frederic J. |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1988 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Subject Stages: Marriage, Theatre and the Law in Early Modern Spain |first=Mar\u00eda M. |last=Carri\u00f3n |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2010 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |first=Eug\u00e8ne |last=Isabey |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url=http://art.thewalters.org/detail/30480 |title=The Departure of Elisabeth of France for Spain |year=1858 |ref=harv}} \n*{{cite book |title=Philip of Spain |url=https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame |url-access=registration |first=Henry |last=Kamen |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1997 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Catherine de'Medici |first=R.J. |last=Knecht |publisher=Longman |year=1999 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor-first1=Helen |editor-last1=Nader |title=Power and Gender in Renaissance Spain: Eight Women of the Mendoza Family, 1450-1650 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2003 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Natalie R. |last=Tomas |title=The Medici Women: Gender and Power in Renaissance Florence. |location=Aldershot, UK |publisher=Ashgate |year=2003 |isbn=0-7546-0777-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/latrmoillefami00whalrich#page/n65 |title=The La Tr\u00e9moille family |last=Whale |first=Winifred Stephens |date=1914 |publisher=Boston, Houghton Mifflin |pages=43 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-hou|[[House of Valois-Angoul\u00eame|House of Valois, Angoul\u00eame branch]]|2 April|1545|3 October|1568|[[Capetian dynasty]]}}\n{{S-roy|es}}\n{{S-bef|rows=|before=[[Mary I of England]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[List of Spanish consorts|Queen consort of Spain]]|years=1559\u20131568}}\n{{S-aft|rows=|after=[[Anne of Austria, Queen of Spain|Anne of Austria]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Spanish consorts}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elizabeth Of Valois}}\n[[Category:People from Fontainebleau]]\n[[Category:1545 births]]\n[[Category:1568 deaths]]\n[[Category:Smallpox survivors]]\n[[Category:French princesses|Elisabeth of Valois]]\n[[Category:Spanish royal consorts]]\n[[Category:Royal consorts of Naples]]\n[[Category:Royal consorts of Sicily]]\n[[Category:House of Valois-Angoul\u00eame|Elisabeth of Valois]]\n[[Category:Deaths in childbirth]]\n[[Category:Burials in the Pantheon of Infantes at El Escorial]]\n[[Category:Philip II of Spain]]\n[[Category:16th-century Spanish women]]\n[[Category:16th-century French women]]\n[[Category:16th-century Spanish people]]\n[[Category:16th-century French people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty|name=Elisabeth of Valois|image=Isabel de Valois2..jpg|caption=\u00c9lisabeth de Valois, by [[Juan Pantoja de la Cruz]], (also attributed to [[Sofonisba Anguissola]])|succession=[[List of Spanish consorts|Queen consort of Spain]]|reign=22 June 1559 \u2013 3  October 1568|birth_date=2 April 1545|birth_place=[[Palace of Fontainebleau]]|death_date={{Death date and age|1568|10|3|1545|4|13|df=y}}|death_place=[[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]]|burial_place=[[El Escorial]]|consort=yes|spouse={{marriage|[[Philip II of Spain]]|1559}}|issue={{plain list|\n* [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella, Lady of the Netherlands]]\n* [[Catherine Michelle of Spain|Catherine Michelle, Duchess of Savoy]]\n}}|full name=|house=[[House of Valois-Angoul\u00eame|Valois-Angoul\u00eame]]|father=[[Henry II of France]]|mother=[[Catherine de' Medici]]|religion=[[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]}}\n'''Elisabeth of Valois''' ({{lang-es|Isabel de Valois}}; {{lang-fr|\u00c9lisabeth de France}}) (2 April 1545 &ndash; 3 October 1568) was a [[List of Spanish consorts|Spanish queen consort]] as the third spouse of [[Philip II of Spain]].

Originally [[Proxy marriage|married via proxy]] at [[Notre Dame Cathedral|Notre Dame]] (with the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] standing in for Philip) prior to leaving France,{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}} the actual ceremony took place in [[Guadalajara (province)|Guadalajara]], Spain, upon her arrival. The marriage was a result of the [[Peace of Cateau Cambr\u00e9sis]] (1559).{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=74}} His second wife, [[Mary I of England]], had recently died, making Elisabeth of Valois Philip's third wife.\n\nAt her wedding, she met the famous painter [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] and [[Ana de Mendoza, Princess of Eboli|Ana de Mendoza]], who would live with her the rest of her life.{{sfn|Nader|2003|p=1}} [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] appointed Anguissola to be a lady-in-waiting and court painter for his queen. Under Anguissola's tutelage, Elisabeth improved her amateur painting skills. Anguissola also influenced the artistic works of her children, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]] and [[Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain|Caterina Michaela]], during her time at the court.\n\nPhilip was completely enchanted by his 14-year-old bride,{{sfn|Carri\u00f3n|2010|p=74}} and by 1564 had given up his infidelities.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=90}} Despite the significant age difference, Elisabeth was also quite pleased with her husband. (In letters to her mother, she proclaimed herself to be fortunate to have married so charming a prince.) Philip enjoyed hosting [[Chivalry in Spain|chivalric]] tournaments to entertain his wife.  Elisabeth would play liege lady to the three young princes of the Spanish Court: [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], [[John of Austria]] (illegitimate son of Charles V), and [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (son of Charles V's illegitimate daughter Margaret).\n\nElisabeth had originally been betrothed to Philip's son, [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], but political complications unexpectedly necessitated instead a marriage to Philip. Her relationship with her troubled stepson Carlos was warm and friendly. Despite reports of his progressively bizarre behavior, Carlos was always kind and gentle to Elisabeth.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=120-121}}  When it eventually became necessary for Philip to lock him away (which shortly led to the Prince's demise), Elisabeth cried for days.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=121}}\n[[File:Felipe&Elisabeth.jpeg|thumb|Coronation of Elisabeth de Valois  as Queen of Spain ]]\nPhilip was very attached to Elisabeth, staying close by her side even when she was ill with [[smallpox]]. Elisabeth's first pregnancy in 1564 ended with a [[miscarriage]] of twin girls. She later gave birth to [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]] on 12 August 1566, and then to Isabella's younger sister [[Catherine Michelle of Spain]] on 10 October 1567.Phillip and Elisabeth were very close to both of their daughters buying them jams, dolls, toys and more.It is said ' both rejoiced at the birth of Isabella as if it had been the birth of a son'.  Elisabeth had another miscarriage on 3 October 1568, and died the same day,{{sfn|Knecht|1988|p=134}} along with her newborn infant daughter.\n\nAfter the death of Elisabeth, [[Catherine de' Medici]] offered her younger daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for Philip.{{sfn|Knecht|1988|p=134}} Philip declined the offer.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|p=125}}\n\n==In fiction==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Elisabeth of France (1545-1568), Queen Consort of Spain.svg|thumb|150px|Coat of arms of Elisabeth of France, Queen of Spain.]]\n\nElisabeth of Valois is a central character in [[Thomas Otway]]'s play ''Don Carlos'', in [[Schiller]]'s [[Don Carlos (play)|play of the same name]],  in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera adapted from Schiller's play, also titled ''[[Don Carlos]]'', and in [[Don Carlos (play)#Opera adaptations|several other, less well-known operas]]; [[Antonio Buzzolla]]'s version of 1850 is actually named \"Elisabetta di Valois\". All these works imply a tragic romance between Elisabeth and Carlos, suggesting that they were really in love with each other when Elisabeth was forced to break off her engagement to Carlos and marry his father Philip.\n\nIn [[Madame de Lafayette]]'s novella ''The Princesse de Cleves'', Elisabeth of Valois' marriage to Philip II is the occasion for the wedding games at which her father [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] dies; her role is brief but it substantially affects the novella's narrative arc.\n\nElisabeth of Valois is portrayed by Caoimhe O'Malley (in the Pilot) on the CW show, [[Reign (TV series)|Reign]], then later by [[Anastasia Phillips]] in the fourth season of the show. Rather than the \u201cplain Jane\u201d of her family the character is portrayed as beautiful and her timid and shy personality is changed to that of one more forceful, cold, insensitive and quite controlling which is driven out of her legitimate desire for her [[Catherine de' Medici|mother's]] affections. Her name ''Elisabeth'' is spelled with an S instead of a Z though in the fourth season she is simply called ''Leeza'' as not to be confused with [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. In the first episode, Leeza is married to King Philip of Spain, leaves for Spain with her husband without speaking any lines, and isn't physically seen until fourth season of the show. Though not seen until the fourth season, she is mentioned as a possible option for god-mother to her King Francis' (her brother's) son John in the second season. In the third season, her kingdom is chosen as a safe haven for her younger sisters and brothers after a group calling themselves \"The Red Knights\" threaten revenge on the Valois family. Making her physical return to the show, she is one of the four Queens ([[Mary, Queen of Scots|Queen Mary]], Queen Elizabeth I and her mother, regent Queen Catherine) to be featured during the season. During her appearance, she spends time in French court as an [[Diplomacy|envoy]] of Spain and voice of her husband's wishes as well rival for her mother.\n\nElisabeth of Valois is a major character in ''The Creation of Eve'', a novel by Lynn Cullen based on the history of [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], the first renowned female artist of the Italian Renaissance. In the novel, Sofonisba is the painting tutor and premier lady-in-waiting for young Queen Elisabeth.\n\n[[File:DianedAndouins1565.jpg|alt=sometimes regareced as DianedAndouins|thumb|Portrait of Elisabeth of valois and Isabella Clara Eugenia ]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |title=Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France |volume=1 |trans-title=Genealogical and chronological history of the royal house of France |last=Anselme de Sainte-Marie |first=P\u00e8re |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76026j/f149.image |publisher=La compagnie des libraires |location=Paris |language=fr |edition=3rd |year=1726 |ref={{harvid|Anselme|1726}} }}\n*{{cite book |title=Henry II, King of France:1547-1559 |last=Baumgartner |first=Frederic J. |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1988 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Subject Stages: Marriage, Theatre and the Law in Early Modern Spain |first=Mar\u00eda M. |last=Carri\u00f3n |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2010 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web |first=Eug\u00e8ne |last=Isabey |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url=http://art.thewalters.org/detail/30480 |title=The Departure of Elisabeth of France for Spain |year=1858 |ref=harv}} \n*{{cite book |title=Philip of Spain |url=https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame |url-access=registration |first=Henry |last=Kamen |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1997 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=Catherine de'Medici |first=R.J. |last=Knecht |publisher=Longman |year=1999 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor-first1=Helen |editor-last1=Nader |title=Power and Gender in Renaissance Spain: Eight Women of the Mendoza Family, 1450-1650 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2003 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Natalie R. |last=Tomas |title=The Medici Women: Gender and Power in Renaissance Florence. |location=Aldershot, UK |publisher=Ashgate |year=2003 |isbn=0-7546-0777-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/latrmoillefami00whalrich#page/n65 |title=The La Tr\u00e9moille family |last=Whale |first=Winifred Stephens |date=1914 |publisher=Boston, Houghton Mifflin |pages=43 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-hou|[[House of Valois-Angoul\u00eame|House of Valois, Angoul\u00eame branch]]|2 April|1545|3 October|1568|[[Capetian dynasty]]}}\n{{S-roy|es}}\n{{S-bef|rows=|before=[[Mary I of England]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=[[List of Spanish consorts|Queen consort of Spain]]|years=1559\u20131568}}\n{{S-aft|rows=|after=[[Anne of Austria, Queen of Spain|Anne of Austria]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Spanish consorts}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elizabeth Of Valois}}\n[[Category:People from Fontainebleau]]\n[[Category:1545 births]]\n[[Category:1568 deaths]]\n[[Category:Smallpox survivors]]\n[[Category:French princesses|Elisabeth of Valois]]\n[[Category:Spanish royal consorts]]\n[[Category:Royal consorts of Naples]]\n[[Category:Royal consorts of Sicily]]\n[[Category:House of Valois-Angoul\u00eame|Elisabeth of Valois]]\n[[Category:Deaths in childbirth]]\n[[Category:Burials in the Pantheon of Infantes at El Escorial]]\n[[Category:Philip II of Spain]]\n[[Category:16th-century Spanish women]]\n[[Category:16th-century French women]]\n[[Category:16th-century Spanish people]]\n[[Category:16th-century French people]]\n", "name_user": "Jowhuang", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eQueen of Spain:adding spaces", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Valois"}

The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade [[stenosis|narrowing]] of the coronary arteries can induce transient [[ischemia]] which leads to the induction of a [[ventricular arrhythmia]], which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as [[ventricular fibrillation]], which often leads to death.<ref name=\"AmbroseSingh2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrose JA, Singh M | title = Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes | journal = F1000prime Reports | volume = 7 | pages = 08 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25705391 | pmc = 4311268 | doi = 10.12703/P7-08 }}</ref>\n\nTypically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] \u2013 to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]]. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of [[calciphylaxis]] as it occurs in [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[hemodialysis]] (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these people suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large \"pimples\" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow.

Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the \"[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]\", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] (\"clot buster\" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a \"non-ST elevation MI\" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term \"unstable angina\" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s \u2013 irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.\n\n===Risk assessment===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThere are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is [[Framingham Score]], used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure. When it comes to predicting risk in younger adults (18-39 years old), Framingham Risk Score remains below 10-12% for all deciles of baseline-predicted risk<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berry|first=Jarett D.|last2=Lloyd-Jones|first2=Donald M.|last3=Garside|first3=Daniel B.|last4=Greenland|first4=Philip|date=2007-07|title=Framingham risk score and prediction of coronary heart disease death in young men|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584558|journal=American Heart Journal|volume=154|issue=1|pages=80\u201386|doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2007.03.042|issn=1097-6744|pmc=2279177|pmid=17584558}}</ref>.\n\n[[Polygenic score]] is another way of risk assessment and increasingly getting popularity.

The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade [[stenosis|narrowing]] of the coronary arteries can induce transient [[ischemia]] which leads to the induction of a [[ventricular arrhythmia]], which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as [[ventricular fibrillation]], which often leads to death.<ref name=\"AmbroseSingh2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrose JA, Singh M | title = Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes | journal = F1000prime Reports | volume = 7 | pages = 08 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25705391 | pmc = 4311268 | doi = 10.12703/P7-08 }}</ref>\n\nTypically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] \u2013 to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]]. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of [[calciphylaxis]] as it occurs in [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[hemodialysis]] (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these people suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease.

Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the \"[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]\", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] (\"clot buster\" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a \"non-ST elevation MI\" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term \"unstable angina\" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s \u2013 irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.\n\n===Risk assessment===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThere are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is [[Framingham Score]], used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.\n\n==Prevention==\nUp to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McGill HC, McMahan CA, Gidding SS | title = Preventing heart disease in the 21st century: implications of the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study | journal = Circulation | volume = 117 | issue = 9 | pages = 1216\u201327 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18316498 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.717033 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeal CJ, Dajani T, Wilson D, Cassidy-Bushrow AE, Dickerson JB, Ory M | title = Hypercholesterolemia in youth: opportunities and obstacles to prevent premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 20\u20138 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20425267 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-009-0072-0 }}</ref> Prevention involves adequate physical [[exercise]], decreasing [[obesity]], treating [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], eating a [[healthy diet]], decreasing [[cholesterol]] levels, and [[smoking cessation|stopping smoking]].
