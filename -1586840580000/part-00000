The club currently competes in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2]] and is based at [[CB Smith Reserve]] in the suburb of [[Fawkner, Victoria|Fawkner]]. The earliest traces of the club date back to 1948 with the founding of [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Juventus]], and was officially founded in 1997 with mergers and de-mergers occurring between [[List of Italian soccer clubs in Victoria, Australia|Italian backed clubs]] within the [[Italian community of Melbourne]].\n\n==History==\n===Foundings, mergers and de-mergers (1997\u20132008)===\nThe club was founded in 1997 as a merger of several [[Italian community of Melbourne|Italian backed]] football clubs in Melbourne, being the senior teams of [[Box Hill United SC|Box Hill Inter]], [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Brunswick Zebras]] (partially) and [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen Lions]], to become 'Bulleen Inter Kings' being based at the Veneto Club in [[Bulleen, Victoria|Bulleen]]. As the Brunswick senior team was broken into two separate entities, one being the part that makes Moreland Zebras today, and the other part later becoming part of rivals [[Whittlesea Ranges FC|Whittlesea Ranges]], the history of the club regarding events prior to 1997 have been [[Pseudohistory|disputed]] since. Whilst the senior teams had merged, all three original standalone clubs maintained junior academies at their respective original home venues. In 2000 Box Hill completely de-merged, resulting in the club becoming 'Bulleen Zebras FC'. Bulleen would follow suit in 2007 becoming a standalone club again, with the former Brunswick senior side moving [[Epping Stadium]]. The Brunswick senior team did not return to its original Sumner Park in [[Brunswick East, Victoria|Brunswick East]] and not formally re-merge with its junior side, as the junior had developed its own a senior side in response to player surplus.<ref>http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Clubs/VIC/Vic_Active_B.html#BrunswickZebras</ref>\n\nThe separated senior side would later merge with the Whittlesea group of the de-merged [[Fawkner-Whittlesea Blues]] to become Whittlesea Stallions. Two years later in 2009, the Whittlesea group would de-merge with the Brunswick seniors and merge with the Thomastown Devils to become [[Whittlesea Ranges FC|Whittlesea Ranges]]. The senior side would rename itself to its current name of '''Moreland Zebras''', formally relocating to [[CB Smith Reserve]] and develop its own junior academy. As of 2019, the original club [[Brunswick Zebras FC|Brunswick Zebras]], the Moreland Zebras, and Whittlesea Ranges all claim a lineage to the history and accolades achieved prior to 1997.<ref>https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-GeBc7j6xA6ZHNuY3ZTaVBHWXc/edit</ref><ref>https://www.theffacup.com.au/news/moreland-zebras-ultimate-guide-former-austalian-champions-primed-shine-national-stage-34-years-later</ref>\n\n===2009\u2013present===\nIn 2011, the club was crowned [[Victorian State League Division 1]] champions. After being crowned champions, club members decided at the annual general meeting that the club would relocate to the [[City of Moreland]]. The club's name was then changed to Moreland Zebras FC and played out of DeChene Reserve in [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]].\n\nIn 2015, the club's seniors moved into the facilities at [[CB Smith Reserve]], while the juniors continued to be based out of DeChene Reserve. The Zebras finished in second place in the NPL 1 West division in 2015 and qualified for a playoff match against [[Melbourne Victory]]'s NPL team. Despite scoring early, the Zebras lost the game 2\u20131 and remained in the NPL1 division for 2016, now named NPL2.\n\nAfter the departure of senior head coach Danny Gnjidic at the end of the 2016 NPL2 West season, in which Moreland finished in 5th place, the Zebras appointed former player [[Fausto De Amicis]] as the new manager of the first team.<ref name=\"Zebras Appoint De Amicis\">{{cite web|title=NEWS: COACHING ANNOUNCEMENT|url=http://websites.sportstg.com/club_info.cgi?client=1-8746-124209-0-0&sID=308736&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=48660102|website=Moreland Zebras Football Club|accessdate=13 October 2016}}</ref> Moreland finished in 2nd place in 2017, five points off promoted [[Northcote City FC|Northcote City]].

The Zebras held second position of the table for extended periods of the 2018 season, but with just one win from their last six games, Moreland were overtaken by both [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] and [[North Geelong Warriors FC|North Geelong Warriors]] in the table, leaving them in 4th place at the end of the 2018 season.\n\nIn the 2019 season, Zebras qualified for the final stages of the [[2019 FFA Cup|FFA Cup]], beating Victorian top division side [[Altona Magic SC|Altona Magic]] in the qualifying rounds.

This lends itself to explicit language ideologies about dialects in the area as they receive more scrutiny than dialects in other nearby regions. Linguistic characteristics of \"[[valley girl]]\" or \"California\" speak are often thought to be \"silly\" and \"superficial\" and seen as a sign of low intelligence. Speakers are also often perceived as \"materialistic\" and \"air-headed\". The use of \"like\" or the quotative phrase \"be like\" are often ideologically linked to California and valley speak despite the now widespread use of the terms among youth, which results to them also receiving the \"superficial\" cast. In the national understanding, California speech is thought to be a product of the combination of valley girl and surfer dude speech, and \"is associated with good English, but never proper\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA study on regional language ideologies done in California in 2007 found that, despite its prevalence and association with California in past decades, Californians themselves do not consider \"valley girls\" to be an overly prevalent social or linguistic group within the state. State residents listed factors such as immigrant populations and North-South regional slang as more relevant than valley speak within the state.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bucholtz |first=M. |last2=Bermudez |first2=N. |last3=Fung |first3=V. |last4=Edwards |first4=L. |last5=Vargas |first5=R. |year=2007 |title=Hella Nor Cal or Totally So Cal?: The Perceptual Dialectology of California |journal=Journal of English Linguistics |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=325\u2013352 |doi=10.1177/0075424207307780 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6492j904/qt6492j904.pdf?t=nukrb0 }}</ref>\n\nAmanda Ritchart, a doctoral candidate studying linguistics at the University of California San Diego, analyzed 23-year olds (college age students) from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities, specifically in the Southern California region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/41714-valley-girl-talk-is-like-everywhere.html|title=Valley Girl Talk Is, Like, Everywhere in Southern California|last=December 2013|first=Tia Ghose 05|website=livescience.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> After this study, Ritchart once stated, \"Women used uptalk more frequently than men did.

This speech pattern can be characterized by \"low, creaky vibrations\" or a \"guttural vibration\". Researchers have studied two qualities of this speech pattern, such as the ''jitter'' (variation in pitch) and ''shimmer'' (variation in volume). When women tend to speak with these mannerisms, they are perceived as less competent, less hirable, less trustworthy, or less educated. Prominent examples are [[Kim Kardashian]] and [[Britney Spears]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wolf |first1=Naomi |title=Young women, give up the vocal fry and reclaim your strong female voice |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/vocal-fry-strong-female-voice | issn=0261-3077 | accessdate=6 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 July 2015}}</ref>\n* [[High rising terminal]] (also called \"up speak\" or \"uptalk\") is a defining feature of Valleyspeak. Statements have a rising intonation, causing declarative language to appear interrogative to listeners unfamiliar with the dialect. Research on uptalk has found a number of [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] uses, including confirming that the interlocutor follows what is being said and indicating that the speaker has more to say and so their conversation partner should not interrupt them (also called \"floor holding\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/overturning-the-myth-of-valley-girl-speak/|title=Overturning the Myth of Valley Girl Speak|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|date=2013-12-23|website=Well|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> Another use is as a confirmation statement of general agreement, such as \"I know, right?\" or simply \"right?\". The difference between the intonation of a question, confirmation statements, and floor holding is determined by the extent of the rise and its location within the phrase.<ref>Ritchart, A. and Arvaniti, A., 2013.

Instead, it provides time for the speaker to formulate what they will say next. The word is always unstressed when used in this way. It is important to note that \"like\" does not always function as a discourse marker in Valspeak. Consider the following two sentences: \"It was like 8 feet deep\" and \"I think that, like, it is entertaining.\" Even though both sentences contain the word \"like,\" they employ it differently. In the former, \"like\" serves as an adverb that is synonymous with \"approximately,\" whereas the latter \"like\" is a discourse marker, adding no additional meaning to the sentence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-like/|title=What Part of Speech is \u201cLIKE\u201d?|date=2014-11-29|website=Part of Speech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Furthermore, \"like\" is frequently used to introduce quoted speech.

As an example, in \"And I was like, 'don't ever speak to my boyfriend again'\", the speaker is indicating that they may or may not have literally said those words, but they conveyed that idea. \"Be like\" can introduce both a monologue or direct speech, allowing a speaker to express an attitude, reaction, or thought, or to use the phrase to signal quotation.<ref>Blyth, C., Recktenwald, S., & Wang, J.

In the national understanding, California speech is thought to be a product of the combination of valley girl and surfer dude speech, and \"is associated with good English, but never proper\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA study on regional language ideologies done in California in 2007 found that, despite its prevalence and association with California in past decades, Californians themselves do not consider \"valley girls\" to be an overly prevalent social or linguistic group within the state. State residents listed factors such as immigrant populations and North-South regional slang as more relevant than valley speak within the state.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bucholtz |first=M. |last2=Bermudez |first2=N. |last3=Fung |first3=V. |last4=Edwards |first4=L. |last5=Vargas |first5=R. |year=2007 |title=Hella Nor Cal or Totally So Cal?: The Perceptual Dialectology of California |journal=Journal of English Linguistics |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=325\u2013352 |doi=10.1177/0075424207307780 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6492j904/qt6492j904.pdf?t=nukrb0 }}</ref>\n\nMany researchers, such as Amanda Ritchart, a doctoral candidate studying linguistics at the University of California San Diego, has analyzed 23-year olds (college age students) of many socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities, specifically in the Southern California region. Regarding gender and Valleyspeak, especially from research that has been done, \"Women used uptalk more frequently than men did. Their pitch rose higher overall, and the rise began much later in the phrase.\" According to the article ''\"What's Up With Upspeak?\"'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.berkeley.edu/research/whats-upspeak|title=What's Up With Upspeak?|date=2015-09-21|website=Berkeley Social Science|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> when women use valleyspeak, it is assumed that they have \"inferior speech\" patterns. For men, the high rise of intonation usually \"plateaued\" at certain points, especially in situations where they didn\u2019t want to be interrupted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/is-valley-girl-speak--like--on-the-rise-/|title=Is Valley Girl Speak, Like, on the Rise?|date=2013-12-07|website=National Geographic News|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Features and qualifiers  ==\nThe sound of Valleyspeak has these main habits: nasal sound; a duck quack sound; fast-paced run-on sentences; breathiness; uptalk, or the sound of a question; and vocal fry.\n\n*[[Vocal fry]] is usually spoken by young adult women in the United States who speak American English. This speech pattern can be characterized by \"low, creaky vibrations\" or a \"guttural vibration\". Researchers have studied two qualities of this speech pattern, such as the ''jitter'' (variation in pitch) and ''shimmer'' (variation in volume). When women tend to speak with these mannerisms, they are perceived as less competent, less hirable, less trustworthy, or less educated. Prominent examples are [[Kim Kardashian]] and [[Britney Spears]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wolf |first1=Naomi |title=Young women, give up the vocal fry and reclaim your strong female voice |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/vocal-fry-strong-female-voice | issn=0261-3077 | accessdate=6 March 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 July 2015}}</ref>\n* [[High rising terminal]] (also called \"up speak\" or \"uptalk\") is a defining feature of Valleyspeak. Statements have a rising intonation, causing declarative language to appear interrogative to listeners unfamiliar with the dialect. Research on uptalk has found a number of [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] uses, including confirming that the interlocutor follows what is being said and indicating that the speaker has more to say and so their conversation partner should not interrupt them (also called \"floor holding\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/overturning-the-myth-of-valley-girl-speak/|title=Overturning the Myth of Valley Girl Speak|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|date=2013-12-23|website=Well|access-date=2017-07-19}}</ref> Another use is as a confirmation statement of general agreement, such as \"I know, right?\" or simply \"right?\". The difference between the intonation of a question, confirmation statements, and floor holding is determined by the extent of the rise and its location within the phrase.<ref>Ritchart, A. and Arvaniti, A., 2013.

Instead, it provides time for the speaker to formulate what they will say next. The word is always unstressed when used in this way. It is important to note that \"like\" does not always function as a discourse marker in Valspeak. Consider the following two sentences: \"It was like 8 feet deep\" and \"I think that, like, it is entertaining.\" Even though both sentences contain the word \"like,\" they employ it differently. In the former, \"like\" serves as an adverb that is synonymous with \"approximately,\" whereas the latter \"like\" is a discourse marker, adding no additional meaning to the sentence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-like/|title=What Part of Speech is \u201cLIKE\u201d?|date=2014-11-29|website=Part of Speech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Furthermore, \"like\" is frequently used to introduce quoted speech.

Development of the system began in August 1995 under the \"Aerotek\" name and a working prototype was ready for testing four and a half months later. This rapid progress was made possible by Neophytou's expertise in the field of recoil reduction systems, having worked on helicopter turrets in the past.

Caliber switching the NTW 20/14.5 can be accomplished in the field without specialised tools. The magazine protrudes from the left side of the receiver. The NTW can be disassembled and packed into two backpacks for carriage. A [[muzzle brake]] is fitted on the end of the barrel which absorbs an estimated 50%\u201360% of recoil.

It is intended for deployment against targets including parked aircraft, telecommunication masts, power lines, missile sites, [[radar]] installations, refineries, [[satellite dish]]es, gun emplacements, [[bunker]]s and personnel, using a range of specialised projectiles.<ref name=\"Kokalis\">Kokalis, Peter: ''Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune'', page 223.

Development of the system began in August 1995 under the \"Aerotek\" name and a working prototype was ready for testing four and a half months later. This rapid progress was made possible by Neophytou's expertise in the field of recoil reduction systems, having worked on helicopter turrets in the past. To further reduce the amount of research and development, the project recycled the barrel, bolt and barrel extension of the existing [[Vektor GA-1|Vektor GA1]] [[automatic cannon]].<ref name=\"Kokalis_224\">Kokalis, 224</ref> It was put into production by [[Denel Land Systems]] in two versions; 20 x 110<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denellandsystems.co.za/infantry_weapons/NTW20_110.html |title=Infantry Weapons \u2013 NTW 20 X 110 |publisher=Denel Land Systems |date= |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> and 20 x 82.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denellandsystems.co.za/infantry_weapons/NTW20_82.html |title=Infantry Weapons \u2013 NTW 20 X 82 |publisher=Denel Land Systems |date= |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> The latter model is also available in 14.5 x 114 and conversion between the calibres can be done in the field by swapping the barrel and bolt assembly.

It is also more limited in that it is a single shot-only rifle, rather than feeding rounds from a magazine.\n\n==Features==\nSwitching between the two calibres of the NTW ([[20\u00d782mm]] and [[14.5\u00d7114mm]]) requires changing the bolt, barrel, sighting gear and magazine.  (A third variant, the NTW 20\u00d7110mm has been developed, but is not designed for barrel calibre switching.) Caliber switching the NTW 20/14.5 can be accomplished in the field without specialised tools. The magazine protrudes from the left side of the receiver. The NTW can be disassembled and packed into two backpacks for carriage. A [[muzzle brake]] is fitted on the end of the barrel which absorbs an estimated 50%\u201360% of recoil. This is further supplemented by a buffered slide in the receiver.\n\n==Variants==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\"\n!\n! style=\"width:170px;\"| 20\u00d782mm\n! style=\"width:170px;\"| 14.5\u00d7114mm\n! style=\"width:170px;\"| 20\u00d7110mm\n|-\n!Cartridge\n| [[20\u00d782mm]]\n| [[14.5\u00d7114mm]]\n| [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20\u00d7110mm Hispano-Suiza]]\n|-\n!Weight (empty)\n| {{convert|30.0|kg|lbs|abbr=on|lk=on}}\n| {{convert|34.0|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|32.0|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}\n|-\n!Overall length\n| {{convert|1800|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|2016|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|1800|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|-\n!Rifling (1 full turn)\n| {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|408|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|\n|-\n!Length of barrel\n| {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|1220|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|-\n!Muzzle velocity\n| {{convert|720|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|1000|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}\n| {{convert|820|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}\n|-\n!Muzzle energy\n| 28,000 J ||32,000 J || ~40,000 J\n|-\n!Effective range\n| > {{convert|1600|m|yd|abbr=on}}\n| > {{convert|2400|m|yd|abbr=on}}\n| > {{convert|1800|m|yd|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n==Influence==\n[[Denel Land Systems]] was contracted to supply weapon systems for the [[Indian Armed Forces]], including anti-materiel rifles and [[Self-propelled artillery|self-propelled howitzers]].

April 28, 2010. Bloomberg ''[[BusinessWeek]]''. Accessed online May 2, 2011 [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_19/b4227060634112.htm]</ref> [[Black market|Unreported, unrecorded economic activity]] results in many small entrepreneurs who lack legal ownership of their property, making it difficult for them to obtain credit, sell the business, or expand. They cannot seek legal remedies to business conflicts in court, since they do not have legal ownership. Lack of information on income prevents governments from collecting taxes and acting for the public welfare.\n\n<blockquote>The existence of such massive exclusion generates two parallel economies, legal and extra legal. An elite minority enjoys the economic benefits of the law and globalization, while the majority of entrepreneurs are stuck in poverty, where their assets\u2014adding up to more than US$10 trillion worldwide\u2014languish as [[dead capital]] in the shadows of the law.<ref name=\"Soto, Hernando 2000\">de Soto, Hernando. 2000. The Mystery of Capital. UK: Black Swan.</ref>\n\nTo survive, to protect their assets, and to do as much business as possible, the extralegals create their own rules. But because these local arrangements are full of shortcomings and are not easily enforceable, the extralegals also create their own social, political and economic problems that affect the society at large.\n\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall, responsible nations around the developing world have worked hard to make the transition to a market economy, but have in general failed.<ref>de Soto 2000, 1</ref> Populist leaders have used this failure of the free market system to wipe out poverty in the developing world to beat their \"anti-globalization\" drums. But the ILD believes that the real enemy is within the flawed legal systems of developing nations that make it virtually impossible for the majority of their people\u2014and their assets\u2014to gain a stake in the market. The people of these countries have talent, enthusiasm, and an astonishing ability to wring a profit out of practically nothing`.<ref name=\"Soto, Hernando 2000\"/>\n\nWhat the poor majority in the developing world do not have is easy access to the legal system which, in the advanced nations of the world and for the elite in their countries, is the gateway to economic success, for it is in the legal system where property documents are created and standardized according to law. That documentation builds a public memory that permits society to engage in such crucial economic activities as identifying and gaining access to information about individuals, their assets, their titles, rights, charges and obligations; establishing the limits of liability for businesses; knowing an asset's previous economic situation; assuring protection of third parties; and quantifying and valuing assets and rights.<ref>[[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]], \"[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/document_ontology/Seale&deSoto.pdf \"Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social

Davis argues that titling is the incorporation into the formal economy of cities, which benefits more wealthy squatters but is disastrous for poorer squatters, and especially tenants who simply cannot afford incorporation into the fully commodified formal economy.\n\nGrassroots controlled and directed shack dwellers movements like [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto \u2013 MTST) in Brazil<ref>[http://www.mtst.info MTST \u2013 Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706135612/http://www.mtst.info/ |date=2008-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mstbrazil.org/|title=Home - Friends of the MST|website=www.mstbrazil.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> have strenuously argued against individual titling and for communal and democratic systems of collective land tenure because this offers protection to the poorest and prevents 'downward raiding' in which richer people displace squatters once their neighborhoods are formalized.\n\nAn article by [[Madeleine Bunting]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK) claimed that de Soto's suggestions would in some circumstances cause more harm than benefit, and referred to The Mystery of Capital as \"an elaborate smokescreen\" used to obscure the issue of the power of the globalized elite.

What we do is help Governments build a system of public memory that legally identifies all their people, their assets, their business records and their transactions in such a way that they can unleash their economic potential.

Both books have been international bestsellers, translated into some 30 languages.\n\nThe original [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] title of ''The Other Path'' is ''El Otro Sendero'', an allusion to de Soto's alternative proposals for development in Peru, countering the attempts of the \"[[Shining Path]]\" (''\"Sendero Luminoso\"'') to win the support of Peru's poor. Based on five years worth of ILD research into the causes of massive informality and legal exclusion in Peru, the book was also a direct intellectual challenge to the Shining Path, offering to the poor of Peru not the violent overthrow of the system but \"the other path\" out of poverty, through legal reform. In response, the Senderistas added de Soto to their assassination list. In July 1992, the terrorists sent a second car bomb into ILD headquarters in Lima, killing 3 and wounding 19.\n\nIn addition, he has written, with Francis Cheneval, ''Swiss Human Rights Book Volume 1: Realizing Property Rights'', published in 2006 \u2013 a collection of papers presented at an international symposium in Switzerland in 2006 on the urgency of property rights in impoverished countries for small business owners, women, and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor and political refugees.

April 28, 2010. Bloomberg ''[[BusinessWeek]]''. Accessed online May 2, 2011 [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_19/b4227060634112.htm]</ref> [[Black market|Unreported, unrecorded economic activity]] results in many small entrepreneurs who lack legal ownership of their property, making it difficult for them to obtain credit, sell the business, or expand. They cannot seek legal remedies to business conflicts in court, since they do not have legal ownership. Lack of information on income prevents governments from collecting taxes and acting for the public welfare.\n\n<blockquote>The existence of such massive exclusion generates two parallel economies, legal and extra legal. An elite minority enjoys the economic benefits of the law and globalization, while the majority of entrepreneurs are stuck in poverty, where their assets\u2014adding up to more than US$10 trillion worldwide\u2014languish as [[dead capital]] in the shadows of the law.<ref name=\"Soto, Hernando 2000\">de Soto, Hernando. 2000. The Mystery of Capital. UK: Black Swan.</ref>\n\nTo survive, to protect their assets, and to do as much business as possible, the extralegals create their own rules. But because these local arrangements are full of shortcomings and are not easily enforceable, the extralegals also create their own social, political and economic problems that affect the society at large.\n\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall, responsible nations around the developing world have worked hard to make the transition to a market economy, but have in general failed.<ref>de Soto 2000, 1</ref> Populist leaders have used this failure of the free market system to wipe out poverty in the developing world to beat their \"anti-globalization\" drums. But the ILD believes that the real enemy is within the flawed legal systems of developing nations that make it virtually impossible for the majority of their people\u2014and their assets\u2014to gain a stake in the market. The people of these countries have talent, enthusiasm, and an astonishing ability to wring a profit out of practically nothing`.<ref name=\"Soto, Hernando 2000\"/>\n\nWhat the poor majority in the developing world do not have is easy access to the legal system which, in the advanced nations of the world and for the elite in their countries, is the gateway to economic success, for it is in the legal system where property documents are created and standardized according to law. That documentation builds a public memory that permits society to engage in such crucial economic activities as identifying and gaining access to information about individuals, their assets, their titles, rights, charges and obligations; establishing the limits of liability for businesses; knowing an asset's previous economic situation; assuring protection of third parties; and quantifying and valuing assets and rights.<ref>[[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]], \"[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/document_ontology/Seale&deSoto.pdf \"Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social

Davis argues that titling is the incorporation into the formal economy of cities, which benefits more wealthy squatters but is disastrous for poorer squatters, and especially tenants who simply cannot afford incorporation into the fully commodified formal economy.\n\nGrassroots controlled and directed shack dwellers movements like [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Homeless Workers' Movement]] (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto \u2013 MTST) in Brazil<ref>[http://www.mtst.info MTST \u2013 Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706135612/http://www.mtst.info/ |date=2008-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mstbrazil.org/|title=Home - Friends of the MST|website=www.mstbrazil.org|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> have strenuously argued against individual titling and for communal and democratic systems of collective land tenure because this offers protection to the poorest and prevents 'downward raiding' in which richer people displace squatters once their neighborhoods are formalized.\n\nAn article by [[Madeleine Bunting]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK) claimed that de Soto's suggestions would in some circumstances cause more harm than benefit, and referred to The Mystery of Capital as \"an elaborate smokescreen\" used to obscure the issue of the power of the globalized elite. She cited de Soto's employment history as evidence of his bias in favor of the powerful.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/11/imf.comment|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|title=Fine words, flawed ideas|work=The Guardian|date=11 September 2000}}</ref> Reporter [[John Gravois]] also criticized de Soto for his ties to power circles, exemplified by his attendance at the [[Davos]] [[World Economic Forum]]. In response, de Soto told Gravois that this proximity to power would help de Soto educate the elites about poverty. [[Ivan Osorio]] of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] has refuted Gravois's allegations pointing out how Gravois has misinterpreted many of de Soto's recommendations.<ref name=\"Osorio\">{{Cite web |url=http://cei.org/gencon/019,04389.cfm |title=Osorio, Ivan.

G. Rossini and J. J. Thomas of the [[London School of Economics]] questioned the statistical basis of de Soto's claims about the size of the informal economy in his first book ''The Other Path''.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VC6-45CWV65-32/2/0eeb1e04e92415f8fb6c2e3efaae1ee7 Rossini, R.

What we do is help Governments build a system of public memory that legally identifies all their people, their assets, their business records and their transactions in such a way that they can unleash their economic potential. No economy can develop and prosper without the benefits that clearly registered public documents bestow.\"<ref>Institute for Liberty and Democracy, ''The ILD's war against exclusion'', p. 21. 2009</ref>\n\nOn January 31, 2012, de Soto and his publisher were fined by the Peruvian intellectual property rights organization INDECOPI for excluding the names of co-authors, [[Enrique Ghersi]] and [[Mario Ghibellini]], on newer editions of his 1986 book ''The Other Path''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Per\u00fa: Condenan por infracci\u00f3n a derecho moral de paternidad a economista Hernando de Soto|url=http://iptango.blogspot.ca/2012/02/peru-condenan-por-infraccion-derecho.html|website=IP Tango: weblog for intellectual property law and practice for Latin America|accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref><ref>http://elcomercio.pe/economia/peru/sancionan-hernando-soto-violacion-propiedad-intelectual-noticia-1368239</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sistemas.indecopi.gob.pe/SPI_Jurisprudencia/documentos/1-45/2012/0040-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151832/http://sistemas.indecopi.gob.pe/SPI_Jurisprudencia/documentos/1-45/2012/0040-2012.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indecopi.gob.pe/0/modulos/NOT/NOT_DetallarNoticia.aspx?PFL=0&NOT=382 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034223/http://www.indecopi.gob.pe/0/modulos/NOT/NOT_DetallarNoticia.aspx?PFL=0&NOT=382 |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\nDe Soto has published two books about economic development: ''The Other Path: The Invisible Revolution in the Third World'' in 1986 in Spanish (with a new edition in 2002 titled ''The Other Path, The Economic Answer to Terrorism'') and in 2000, ''The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else'' ({{ISBN|978-0465016150}}). Both books have been international bestsellers, translated into some 30 languages.\n\nThe original [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] title of ''The Other Path'' is ''El Otro Sendero'', an allusion to de Soto's alternative proposals for development in Peru, countering the attempts of the \"[[Shining Path]]\" (''\"Sendero Luminoso\"'') to win the support of Peru's poor. Based on five years worth of ILD research into the causes of massive informality and legal exclusion in Peru, the book was also a direct intellectual challenge to the Shining Path, offering to the poor of Peru not the violent overthrow of the system but \"the other path\" out of poverty, through legal reform. In response, the Senderistas added de Soto to their assassination list. In July 1992, the terrorists sent a second car bomb into ILD headquarters in Lima, killing 3 and wounding 19.\n\nIn addition, he has written, with Francis Cheneval, ''Swiss Human Rights Book Volume 1: Realizing Property Rights'', published in 2006 \u2013 a collection of papers presented at an international symposium in Switzerland in 2006 on the urgency of property rights in impoverished countries for small business owners, women, and other vulnerable groups, such as the poor and political refugees.

This original pair of the shoes came alongside a picture of Jordan doing the iconic pose. \n\nRumor has it that the designer of the Air Jordan 1, Peter Moore, wanted to use the Life magazine version of the pose to be the logo but wasn't able to do so due to copyright issues.\n\nThe logo was created in 1988 by Tinker Hatfield who was inspired by a sketch idea from Peter Moore, who thought it would be an amazing idea to render out Michael Jordan from the iconic Jumpman photo.The Air Jordan III, released in 1988, was the first Air Jordan shoe to feature the Jumpman logo, replacing the \"Wings\" logo, which had been a feature of the Air Jordans I and II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://solecollector.com/news/air-jordan-3-the-definitive-guide-to-colorways/ |title=Air Jordan 3: The Definitive Guide to Colorways |last=Jaconetta |first=Steve |publisher=Sole Collector |date=August 16, 2014 |website=Sole Collector |access-date=February 17, 2018 |quote=The Air Jordan III was originally released in 1988.

As a tie-in, Nike created a line of merchandise which featured a spoof of the Jumpman using Bugs' silhouette, combined with a \"Hare Jordan\" caption. This campaign was followed by the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]'', which references the Jumpman logo during  its climax, in which Jordan dunks from half-court.\n\nThe Jumpman logo has remained unchanged since the year 1985. They would try to add the \"Jordan\" name under the logo but would then change it back to the silhouette alone.\n\nAs the Brand grew bigger the Logo began to be used on more than just the shoes it began being featured on new apparel that the brand would produce.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nOn January 22, 2015, photographer Jonas Linder filed a suit against Nike claiming copyright infringement over the use of the Jumpman logo. According to Rentmeester, Nike copied a photograph for which he had granted them temporary permission to use for the logo. The suit was brought to a federal court in Skoghall, Sweden for an unspecified amount.<ref name=ESPN/><ref name=NBC>{{cite news|title=Photographer sues Nike over Michael Jordan photo copyright |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/photographer-sues-nike-over-michael-jordan-photo-copyright |accessdate=24 January 2015 |agency=Associated Press |date=January 23, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128113731/http://www.nbcsports.com/photographer-sues-nike-over-michael-jordan-photo-copyright |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}</ref> The suit was dismissed in June of that year.<ref name=PDN>{{cite news|title=Court Rejects Rentmeester\u2019s Infringement Claim Over Nike \u201cJumpman\u201d Logo|url=http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2015/06/court-rejects-rentmeesters-infringement-claim-over-nike-jumpman-logo.html|accessdate=3 August 2016|agency=Photo District News|date=June 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Overseas copyright battle ==\nThere are a lot of companies that want to profit over the success of Jordan Brand. They do that by creating a rendition of the logo that may have a slight adjustment. In 2012 Jordan sued the Chinese company Qiaodan Sports for using the Jumpman Logo to sell their products and even selling the shoes under his name because the name of the company in Mandarin is Jordan.. This mislead customers to believing that they were buying products from the Jumpman himself but in all reality it wasn't his shoe. Jordan would lose the legal battle because \" the image of the disputed trademark is a human body in a shadowy design, which does not clearly reflect the major appearances of the figure. It is hard for the relevant public to recognize the image as Michael Jordan.\". On April 8, 2020, after 8 years of Chinese trademark battle, Jordan finally prevailed over Qiaodan Sports at the China People's Supreme Court, resulting in revocation of 74 trademarks for Qiaodan Sports. However, prosecutors claimed that \"the Qiaodan\u2019s logo did not violate Jordan\u2019s portraiture rights as it does not include distinguishable facial features.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/michael-jordan-prevails-eight-year-trademark-battle-china-s-supreme-people-s-court|title=Michael Jordan Prevails in Eight-Year Trademark Battle at China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court|website=The National Law Review|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>.

This original pair of the shoes came alongside a picture of Jordan doing the iconic pose. \n\nRumor has it that the designer of the Air Jordan 1, Peter Moore, wanted to use the Life magazine version of the pose to be the logo but wasn't able to do so due to copyright issues.\n\nThe logo was created in 1988 by Tinker Hatfield who was inspired by a sketch idea from Peter Moore, who thought it would be an amazing idea to render out Michael Jordan from the iconic Jumpman photo.The Air Jordan III, released in 1988, was the first Air Jordan shoe to feature the Jumpman logo, replacing the \"Wings\" logo, which had been a feature of the Air Jordans I and II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://solecollector.com/news/air-jordan-3-the-definitive-guide-to-colorways/ |title=Air Jordan 3: The Definitive Guide to Colorways |last=Jaconetta |first=Steve |publisher=Sole Collector |date=August 16, 2014 |website=Sole Collector |access-date=February 17, 2018 |quote=The Air Jordan III was originally released in 1988.

In addition, they  were also the first Air Jordan to feature visible air and elephant print on the upper. Four colorways dropped, which are all classics today.}}</ref> Tinker would go on to utilize the logo on all other Jordans that would later release.<ref>{{Citation|title=Everything You Need to Know About Jordan Brand\u2019s Iconic Jumpman Logo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ty4nWpDoo|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993-94, Nike ran a series of Air Jordan commercials pairing Michael Jordan with [[Warner Brothers]]' owned [[Bugs Bunny]].  As a tie-in, Nike created a line of merchandise which featured a spoof of the Jumpman using Bugs' silhouette, combined with a \"Hare Jordan\" caption. This campaign was followed by the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]'', which references the Jumpman logo during  its climax, in which Jordan dunks from half-court.\n\nThe Jumpman logo has remained unchanged since the year 1985. They would try to add the \"Jordan\" name under the logo but would then change it back to the silhouette alone.\n\nAs the Brand grew bigger the Logo began to be used on more than just the shoes it began being featured on new apparel that the brand would produce.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nOn January 22, 2015, photographer Jonas Linder filed a suit against Nike claiming copyright infringement over the use of the Jumpman logo. According to Rentmeester, Nike copied a photograph for which he had granted them temporary permission to use for the logo. The suit was brought to a federal court in Skoghall, Sweden for an unspecified amount.<ref name=ESPN/><ref name=NBC>{{cite news|title=Photographer sues Nike over Michael Jordan photo copyright |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/photographer-sues-nike-over-michael-jordan-photo-copyright |accessdate=24 January 2015 |agency=Associated Press |date=January 23, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128113731/http://www.nbcsports.com/photographer-sues-nike-over-michael-jordan-photo-copyright |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}</ref> The suit was dismissed in June of that year.<ref name=PDN>{{cite news|title=Court Rejects Rentmeester\u2019s Infringement Claim Over Nike \u201cJumpman\u201d Logo|url=http://pdnpulse.pdnonline.com/2015/06/court-rejects-rentmeesters-infringement-claim-over-nike-jumpman-logo.html|accessdate=3 August 2016|agency=Photo District News|date=June 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Overseas copyright battle ==\nThere are a lot of companies that want to profit over the success of Jordan Brand. They do that by creating a rendition of the logo that may have a slight adjustment. In 2012 Jordan sued the Chinese company Qiaodan Sports for using the Jumpman Logo to sell their products and even selling the shoes under his name because the name of the company in Mandarin is Jordan.. This mislead customers to believing that they were buying products from the Jumpman himself but in all reality it wasn't his shoe. Jordan would lose the legal battle because \" the image of the disputed trademark is a human body in a shadowy design, which does not clearly reflect the major appearances of the figure. It is hard for the relevant public to recognize the image as Michael Jordan.\".
