The basin contains the waters of the [[Indian Ocean]] south of the [[equator]], and west of [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]]. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]]'s meteorological office in [[R\u00e9union]] (MFR), the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the South-West Indian Ocean, tracked 15&nbsp;tropical disturbances, of which eleven attained [[gale]]-force winds. The season began in October 2006 with a short-lived tropical disturbance, followed by Anita in November, which was the first [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the season. [[Cyclone Bondo]] was the first of six intense tropical cyclones, which took a rare track through the southern [[Seychelles]] before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on northwest [[Madagascar]], killing 11&nbsp;people. Severe Tropical Storm Clovis lasted from December 2006 to January 2007; it struck eastern Madagascar, killing four people.\n\nIn January 2007, Cyclone Dora became one of the two strongest storms of the season, with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 195&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]] (120&nbsp;[[miles per hour]]); Dora only lightly affected the [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] island of [[Rodrigues]]. The season was most active in February, beginning with Severe Tropical Storm Enok, which formed off eastern Madagascar and later struck the island of [[St. Brandon]]. The next storm, [[Cyclone Favio]], tied Dora as the season's strongest storm. Favio took an unusual path south of Madagascar before entering the [[Mozambique Channel]] and striking southern [[Mozambique]], killing 10&nbsp;people and causing widespread flooding. [[Cyclone Gamede]] stalled northwest of the [[Mascarene Islands]] for a few days in late February, resulting in historic rainfall totals on the French island of [[R\u00e9union]]. Over a nine day period, Gamede dropped 5512&nbsp;mm (217&nbsp;in) of rainfall at [[Commerson Crater]], making it among the  [[List of wettest tropical cyclones by country|wettest tropical cyclones on record]]. February concluded with Cyclone Humba, which remained over the eastern portion of the basin.\n\nThe season's deadliest storm was [[Cyclone Indlala]], which struck northeastern Madagascar on March&nbsp;15. The cyclone killed 150&nbsp;people and caused over [[United States dollar|US$240&nbsp;million]] in damage, after resulting in widespread flooding. Less than three weeks after Indlala, Cyclone Jaya struck northeastern Madagascar at a similar location, disrupting ongoing relief efforts and causing one death. The season concluded on April&nbsp;12, when a [[subtropical cyclone]] in the Mozambique Channel transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]].\n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecast and summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/10/2006 till:01/05/2007\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/10/2006\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)   legend:Tropical_Disturbance\n  id:MTS    value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)   legend:Moderate_Tropical_Storm\n  id:STS    value:rgb(0.80,1,1)      legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm\n  id:TC     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)      legend:Tropical_Cyclone\n  id:ITC    value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)   legend:Intense_Tropical_Cyclone\n  id:VITC   value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)   legend:Very_Intense_Tropical_Cyclone\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=  \n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:19/10/2006 till:23/10/2006 color:TD text:\"One\"\n  from:26/11/2006 till:04/12/2006 color:MTS text:\"Anita\"\n  from:15/12/2006 till:28/12/2006 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Bondo|Bondo]]\"\n  from:25/12/2006 till:28/12/2006 color:TD text:\"Four\"\n  from:29/12/2006 till:04/01/2007 color:STS text:\"Clovis\"\n  from:05/01/2007 till:08/01/2007 color:TD text:\"Six\"\n  from:26/01/2007 till:08/02/2007 color:ITC text:\"Dora\"\n   barset:break\n  from:06/02/2007 till:13/02/2007 color:STS text:\"Enok\"\n  from:11/02/2007 till:23/02/2007 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Favio|Favio]]\"\n  from:19/02/2007 till:01/03/2007 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Gamede|Gamede]]\"\n  from:20/02/2007 till:26/02/2007 color:TC text:\"Humba\"\n  from:09/03/2007 till:19/03/2007 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Indlala|Indlala]]\"\n  from:13/03/2007 till:17/03/2007 color:TD text:\"Thirteen\"\n  from:26/03/2007 till:08/04/2007 color:ITC text:\"Jaya\"\n   barset:break\n  from:09/04/2007 till:12/04/2007 color:TD text:\"Fifteen\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/10/2006 till:01/11/2006 text:October\n  from:01/11/2006 till:01/12/2006 text:November\n  from:01/12/2006 till:01/01/2007 text:December\n  from:01/01/2007 till:01/02/2007 text:January\n  from:01/02/2007 till:01/03/2007 text:February\n  from:01/03/2007 till:01/04/2007 text:March\n  from:01/04/2007 till:01/05/2007 text:April\nTextData =\n   pos:(569,23)\n   text:\"(For further details, please see\"\n   pos:(713,23)\n   text:\"[[Tropical_cyclone_scales#Comparisons_across_basins|scales]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nOn October 13, 2006, the [[Mauritius Meteorological Services]] (MMS) issued their seasonal outlook for the South-west Indian Ocean, anticipating a normal season with about 10&nbsp;named storms. They forecast [[El Ni\u00f1o]] conditions for the southern hemisphere, meaning that normal to slightly above normal activity was likely. They also forecast a weak [[Quasi-Biennial Oscillation]], which would promote [[tropical cyclogenesis|cyclone formation]] in the basin. Other seasonal indicators that were conducive for storm formation included above normal [[sea surface temperature|water temperatures]], sustained convective activity, and above normal humidity. The seasonal forecast anticipated that most storms would form west of Diego Garcia, with at least one forming in the Mozambique Channel.<ref name=\"Mauritius preseason\">{{cite report|title=The 2006-2007 Summer Season Outlook|url=http://metservice.intnet.mu/wsoutluk.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206000012/http://metservice.intnet.mu/wsoutluk.htm|archivedate=December 6, 2006|publisher=Mauritius Meteorological Services|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]]'s meteorological office in [[R\u00e9union]] (MFR) &ndash; the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the South-West Indian Ocean &ndash; tracked and named all tropical cyclones from the east coast of Africa to [[90th meridian west|90\u00b0 E]], and south of the equator.<ref>{{cite report|author=Philippe Caroff|date=June 2011|title=Operational procedures of TC satellite analysis at RSMC La Reunion|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=April 22, 2013|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/RSMCLaReunionforIWSATC.pdf|format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC), which is a joint [[United States Navy]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region, also issued advisories for storms during the season.<ref name=\"atcr\"/>\n\nDuring the season, the MFR monitored 15&nbsp;tropical disturbances, including a [[subtropical cyclone]] southwest of Madagascar that ended the season in April.<ref name=\"mms\"/><ref name=\"agp\"/> There were ten systems that attained the intensity of a [[Tropical_cyclone_scales#South-Western_Indian_Ocean|moderate tropical storm]], which has 10&ndash;minute [[maximum sustained winds|sustained winds]] of at least 65&nbsp;km/h (40&nbsp;mph); this is near the long-term average, but much more active than the [[2005\u201306 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|previous season]].

That day, the MFR designated it as a tropical disturbance. Located in an area of low wind shear, the system slowly organized while moving southwestward, developing more convection and outflow over time. On January&nbsp;28, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 10S. On the next day, the MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Dora. The storm quickly intensified, and the JTWC upgraded Dora to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on January&nbsp;30. On February&nbsp;1, the MFR upgraded Dora to tropical cyclone status. By that time, the cyclone was moving slowly south-southeastward between two ridges. Dora turned back to the southwest on February&nbsp;2, and briefly weakened before re-intensifying, possibly the result of an eyewall replacement cycle. On February&nbsp;3, the MFR upgraded Dora to an intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10&ndash;minute winds of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). The JTWC meanwhile estimated peak 1&ndash;minute winds of 215&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph). While at its peak intensity, Dora resembled an [[annular cyclone]], with a large eye and a symmetrical cloud pattern. Cyclone Dora maintained peak intensity for about 12&nbsp;hours before weakening due to cooler, drier air from the southeast. On February&nbsp;5, Dora weakened below tropical cyclone status, as its forward movement also slowed. On February&nbsp;6, Dora passed about 165&nbsp;km (105&nbsp;mi) east of Rodrigues. The thunderstorms around the thunderstorms dwindled due to higher wind shear, until the circulation was entirely exposed on February&nbsp;9. On that day, the MFR reclassified Dora as an extratropical cyclone. The agency tracked the storm for four more days as the storm curved to the south.<ref name=\"mms\"/><ref name=\"jgp\">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|title=Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary January 2007|accessdate=December 13, 2018|url=http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2007/summ0701.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"dbt\">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

[[Tropical_cyclone_scales#South-Western_Indian_Ocean|intense tropical cyclones]] for a season in the [[tropical cyclone basin]], only behind the [[2018\u201319 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|2018\u201319 season]]. The basin contains the waters of the [[Indian Ocean]] south of the [[equator]], and west of [[90th meridian east|90\u00b0E]]. [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]]'s meteorological office in [[R\u00e9union]] (MFR), the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the South-West Indian Ocean, tracked 15&nbsp;tropical disturbances, of which eleven attained [[gale]]-force winds. The season began in October 2006 with a short-lived tropical disturbance, followed by Anita in November, which was the first [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the season. [[Cyclone Bondo]] was the first of six intense tropical cyclones, which took a rare track through the southern [[Seychelles]] before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on northwest [[Madagascar]], killing 11&nbsp;people. Severe Tropical Storm Clovis lasted from December 2006 to January 2007; it struck eastern Madagascar, killing four people.\n\nIn January 2007, Cyclone Dora became one of the two strongest storms of the season, with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 195&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]] (120&nbsp;[[miles per hour]]); Dora only lightly affected the [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] island of [[Rodrigues]]. The season was most active in February, beginning with Severe Tropical Storm Enok, which formed off eastern Madagascar and later struck the island of [[St. Brandon]]. The next storm, [[Cyclone Favio]], tied Dora as the season's strongest storm. Favio took an unusual path south of Madagascar before entering the [[Mozambique Channel]] and striking southern [[Mozambique]], killing 10&nbsp;people and causing widespread flooding. [[Cyclone Gamede]] stalled northwest of the [[Mascarene Islands]] for a few days in late February, resulting in historic rainfall totals on the French island of [[R\u00e9union]]. Over a nine day period, Gamede dropped 5512&nbsp;mm (217&nbsp;in) of rainfall at [[Commerson Crater]], making it among the  [[List of wettest tropical cyclones by country|wettest tropical cyclones on record]]. February concluded with Cyclone Humba, which remained over the eastern portion of the basin.\n\nThe season's deadliest storm was [[Cyclone Indlala]], which struck northeastern Madagascar on March&nbsp;15. The cyclone killed 150&nbsp;people and caused over [[United States dollar|US$240&nbsp;million]] in damage, after resulting in widespread flooding. Less than three weeks after Indlala, Cyclone Jaya struck northeastern Madagascar at a similar location, disrupting ongoing relief efforts and causing one death. The season concluded on April&nbsp;12, when a [[subtropical cyclone]] in the Mozambique Channel transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]].\n\n__TOC__\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecast and summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/10/2006 till:01/05/2007\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/10/2006\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)   legend:Tropical_Disturbance\n  id:MTS    value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)   legend:Moderate_Tropical_Storm\n  id:STS    value:rgb(0.80,1,1)      legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm\n  id:TC     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)      legend:Tropical_Cyclone\n  id:ITC    value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)   legend:Intense_Tropical_Cyclone\n  id:VITC   value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)   legend:Very_Intense_Tropical_Cyclone\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=  \n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:19/10/2006 till:23/10/2006 color:TD text:\"One\"\n  from:26/11/2006 till:04/12/2006 color:MTS text:\"Anita\"\n  from:15/12/2006 till:28/12/2006 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Bondo|Bondo]]\"\n  from:25/12/2006 till:28/12/2006 color:TD text:\"Four\"\n  from:29/12/2006 till:04/01/2007 color:STS text:\"Clovis\"\n  from:05/01/2007 till:08/01/2007 color:TD text:\"Six\"\n  from:26/01/2007 till:08/02/2007 color:ITC text:\"Dora\"\n   barset:break\n  from:06/02/2007 till:13/02/2007 color:STS text:\"Enok\"\n  from:11/02/2007 till:23/02/2007 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Favio|Favio]]\"\n  from:19/02/2007 till:01/03/2007 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Gamede|Gamede]]\"\n  from:20/02/2007 till:26/02/2007 color:TC text:\"Humba\"\n  from:09/03/2007 till:19/03/2007 color:ITC text:\"[[Cyclone Indlala|Indlala]]\"\n  from:13/03/2007 till:17/03/2007 color:TD text:\"Thirteen\"\n  from:26/03/2007 till:08/04/2007 color:ITC text:\"Jaya\"\n   barset:break\n  from:09/04/2007 till:12/04/2007 color:TD text:\"Fifteen\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/10/2006 till:01/11/2006 text:October\n  from:01/11/2006 till:01/12/2006 text:November\n  from:01/12/2006 till:01/01/2007 text:December\n  from:01/01/2007 till:01/02/2007 text:January\n  from:01/02/2007 till:01/03/2007 text:February\n  from:01/03/2007 till:01/04/2007 text:March\n  from:01/04/2007 till:01/05/2007 text:April\nTextData =\n   pos:(569,23)\n   text:\"(For further details, please see\"\n   pos:(713,23)\n   text:\"[[Tropical_cyclone_scales#Comparisons_across_basins|scales]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nOn October 13, 2006, the [[Mauritius Meteorological Services]] (MMS) issued their seasonal outlook for the South-west Indian Ocean, anticipating a normal season with about 10&nbsp;named storms.

That day, the MFR designated it as a tropical disturbance.

On January&nbsp;28, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 10S. On the next day, the MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Dora. The storm quickly intensified, and the JTWC upgraded Dora to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on January&nbsp;30. On February&nbsp;1, the MFR upgraded Dora to tropical cyclone status. By that time, the cyclone was moving slowly south-southeastward between two ridges. Dora turned back to the southwest on February&nbsp;2, and briefly weakened before re-intensifying, possibly the result of an eyewall replacement cycle. On February&nbsp;3, the MFR upgraded Dora to an intense tropical cyclone, estimating peak 10&ndash;minute winds of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph). The JTWC meanwhile estimated peak 1&ndash;minute winds of 215&nbsp;km/h (135&nbsp;mph). While at its peak intensity, Dora resembled an [[annular cyclone]], with a large eye and a symmetrical cloud pattern. Cyclone Dora maintained peak intensity for about 12&nbsp;hours before weakening due to cooler, drier air from the southeast. On February&nbsp;5, Dora weakened below tropical cyclone status, as its forward movement also slowed. On February&nbsp;6, Dora passed about 165&nbsp;km (105&nbsp;mi) east of Rodrigues. The thunderstorms around the thunderstorms dwindled due to higher wind shear, until the circulation was entirely exposed on February&nbsp;9.
