The suggested format was one where after the first round the top six teams would continue while the bottom three teams would have other matches arranged for them.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 86\n| date = 1924-04-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240410.2.136.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-04}}</ref> However all nine teams remained in the grade until the end of the season. The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref>.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. The Secretary of the club, C. J, Williams disputed the way the Auckland Rugby League had handled the matter and several of the facts in a letter to the [[Auckland Star]]. The ARL Chairman, Mr. W.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15-7\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n \n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.

Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXI, Issue 18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref>.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>. On the 18th of July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LV, Issue 162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref>.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, August 23 onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

In addition, increasing numbers of Arabs are studying hi-tech related subjects at tertiary level: whereas there were only 1,600 Arab graduates in high-tech academic studies between 1985 and 2014, over 2,200 Arab students enrolled in high-tech academic studies in 2016 alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://innovationisrael.org.il/sites/default/files/SNC_2018_Human_Capital_Report_Final_0.pdf |title=Human Capital Survey Report 2018 |publisher=Israel Innovation Authority/Start-Up Nation Central |date=December 16, 2018|website=Israel Innovation Authority |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTsofen is a member of [http://www.co-impact.org.il Co-Impact] (formerly Collective Impact), the partnership for a Breakthrough in Arab Employment, which is a partner in President [[Reuven Rivlin]]\u2019s [https://www.israeli-hope.gov.il/en Israeli Hope] initiative focusing on four aspects of Israeli society: Academia, Education, Sports and Employment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.co-impact.org.il/collective-impact-partners |website=Co-Impact |access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Tsofen's theory of change==\nBy supporting the integration of Arab engineers in Israel\u2019s hi-tech industry\u2014especially at a time when it is in great need of qualified personnel\u2014Tsofen aims to influence a deep institutional effect on the industry\u2019s make-up and culture, towards a wider impact: (a) As the Arab community contributes a greater share to Israel\u2019s economic growth it will also enjoy its benefits more equally, improving the socio-economic status of the Arab community and reducing disparities, and (b) Arabs and Jews live will develop a shared society, beginning in the technological work-space, where daily work interactions and relationships are developed that change prejudice, stereotypes and biases.\n \n==Tsofen's model==\n* Nurturing human talent in Arab society by exposing high school students to hi-tech, providing applied technological training to academic students and graduates, and building networks for Arab hi-tech professionals, in cooperation with leading hi-tech firms.  \n* Changing the hi-tech industry landscape by placing thousands of Arab engineers in jobs, by working with hi-tech firms to make recruitment and hiring policies more inclusive, and by bringing hi-tech businesses to Arab cities.  \n* Changing national policies and priorities by \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 its programs within the government, academia, and business sectors.\n\n==Key Tsofen Accomplishments and Impact 2008-2018==\n* Exposing 4,000 Arab high school students to the hi-tech industry and opening to them the option of a hi-tech career. \n* 800 Arab undergraduate students and recent graduates completed 37 applied technological courses.\n* Some 2,000 Arab engineers were placed in hi-tech jobs.\n* 1,200 Arab engineers working in 80 hi-tech firms that opened in Nazareth since 2008, including: [[Microsoft]], Amdocs, [[Broadcom]], Alpha Omega, Galil Software, [[Salesforce.com|SalesForce]].\n* In 2018, the [[Israeli government]] resolved to allocate 25 million [[New Israel Shekel]]s to developing hi-tech parks in two Arab cities.\n\n==Awards==\n* 2012: Sami Saadi (Founding CEO) named in [[The Marker]] 100 Most Influential List<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/israel-s-100-most-influential-people-this-jewish-year-the-full-list-1.5163470 |title=Israel's 100 Most Influential People This Jewish Year / The Full List |publisher=The Marker |date=September 16, 2012 |website=Haaretz |access-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>\n* 2015: Speaker of the [[Knesset|Knesset (Israel's parliament)]] Quality of Life prize for promoting mutual understanding between Jews and Arabs<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.knesset.gov.il/EN/News/PressReleases/pages/Pr11938_pg.aspx |title=Knesset Speakers' Quality of Life Prize awarded to three NGOs;

The road, one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome, became soon one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]], and until the mid of 18th century was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility, which enlivened it with feasts and games. After a two-century eclipse, from the mid-twentieth century the road has been living a rebirth, and now it is again one of the city's most prestigious addresses.\n==Location==\nThe road stretches in south-southeast  north - northwest direction on the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]], between ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], and ''Piazza dell'Oro''. Along its length of about 1 km, it connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road has been named after his builder, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who let it built in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref>It has been also called ''Via Magistralis'' (\"Master road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and also ''Via recta'' (\"Straight road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of the shape of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient ''[[Campus Martius]]'' developed since the early [[Middle Ages]] into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by only three narrow thoroughfares: the ''Via Papalis'' (\"Papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the ''Via Peregrinorum'' (pilgrims' road) <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the ''Via Recta'' (\"Straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> Through these streets, towards the bottleneck of the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]], solemn [[procession]]s squeezed through almost daily since the [[Middle Ages]]. Already in the first [[Jubilee in the Catholic Church|Holy Year]] 1300, proclaimed by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303), the crowds on the bridge to the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] were so large that, as [[Dante Alighieri]] describes in the [[Divine Comedy]], a kind of two-way traffic system had to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Western_Schism#Resolution|the return]] of [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) to Rome in 1420, the masses of pilgrims increased enormously again, especially in the Jubilee years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge, in which more than 300 people died.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe of 1450, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the reconstruction of the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]], thus connecting the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons were also decisive for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI. Pont.

The road, one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome, became soon one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]], and until the mid of 18th century was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility, which enlivened it with feasts and games. After a two-century eclipse, from the mid-twentieth century the road has been living a rebirth, and now it is again one of the city's most prestigious addresses.\n==Location==\nThe road stretches in south-southeast  north - northwest direction on the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]], between ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], and ''Piazza dell'Oro''. Along its length of about 1 km, it connects the [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]] [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road has been named after his builder, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who let it built in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref>It has been also called ''Via Magistralis'' (\"Master road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and also ''Via recta'' (\"Straight road\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) because of the shape of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient ''[[Campus Martius]]'' developed since the early [[Middle Ages]] into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by only three narrow thoroughfares: the ''Via Papalis'' (\"Papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the ''Via Peregrinorum'' (pilgrims' road) <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the ''Via Recta'' (\"Straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> Through these streets, towards the bottleneck of the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]], solemn [[procession]]s squeezed through almost daily since the [[Middle Ages]]. Already in the first [[Jubilee in the Catholic Church|Holy Year]] 1300, proclaimed by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303), the crowds on the bridge to the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] were so large that, as [[Dante Alighieri]] describes in the [[Divine Comedy]], a kind of two-way traffic system had to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Western_Schism#Resolution|the return]] of [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) to Rome in 1420, the masses of pilgrims increased enormously again, especially in the Jubilee years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge, in which more than 300 people died.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe of 1450, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the reconstruction of the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]], thus connecting the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons were also decisive for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nBesides the reconstruction of [[St. Peter's Basilica]],  Julius II implemented many projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae''), a task which had been begun forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484), in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]''.<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref>One of the most import among them was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia, a new representative street through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the quarter of the Florentine merchants on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara then, which in the intentions of the [[Pope]] was to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]], had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/>  and convey the goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]]  and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main idea behind these interventions was to superimpose a regular road network with centre of gravity given by the river on the disorderly set of buildings that was medieval Rome; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]], just opened in the Borgo by Alexander VI, and the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia, which according to the original project should have reached the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] too thanks to the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]'',<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> came to create a regular quadrangular structure in the maze of alleys of the city.<ref name=\"po19\"/> Thanks to these interventions, the center of the city would have moved in the direction of the Vatican and [[Trastevere]], to the detriment of the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], symbol of the power of the Roman nobility.<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> This plan was then intended to curb papal power from the dependence of the city's powerful noble families, above all the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]].<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\nBesides that, these projects had a celebrative goal, strengthening the fame of the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in fact in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope quickly overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families, conquering [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]].<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> An inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' <ref>''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

From the middle of the 16th century onwards, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (\"Beggar's Hospice\"), built in 1586 by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590), marked the end of the Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7976/> The building, which was conceived to solve the begging problem in the city, with a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' could give work to 2,000 men and women.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome, the so called ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred addresses for this purpose. The Florentines (with [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]]), the seneses with [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]] and Neapolitans (with [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]]), had their representative churches built in Via Giulia,<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the churches of the Bologneses (with [[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish (with [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English (with [[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedes (with [[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) lay nearby, being all in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extended over the Tiber and in 1613 a fountain, the Fontanone (\"Big fountain\") di Ponte Sisto, was built on the fa\u00e7ade of the beggars' hospice in the axis of Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> This fountain was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now Piazza Trilussa.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century the course of the Via Giulia was basically fixed.

In the general [[Urban Development]] of Rome via Giulia was rather left out.\n\n===The development in the 18th and 19th century===\nEven in the 18th century the Via Giulia remained mainly a place for the organisation of feasts: in 1720 the Sienese held a splendid festival to celebrate the elevation of their compatriot [[Marc'Antonio Zondadari]] to Grand Master of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]].<ref name=pie798/> In that occasion, a machine with [[fireworks]] was burned near the Fontanone di Ponte Sisto;<ref name=pie7910/> two triumphal arches were raised above the street, one in Santo Spirito and the other near Palazzo Farnese;<ref name=pie798/><ref name=pie7910/> the Fountain of the Mascherone poured wine for the people instead of water.<ref name=pie7910/>\n\nUnder [[Pope Clement XI]] (r. 1720-1721) the beggars housed in the hospice of the same name were transferred to the new hospice of [[San Michele a Ripa]].<ref name=pie7980>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 80</ref> The building on Via Giulia was then partly occupied by poor unmarried girls (\"zitelle\" in [[Romanesco dialect]]), and partly by a congregation made up of 100 priests and 20 clerics who had to pray for the souls of the dead priests.<ref name=pie7980/> Because of this, the building was henceforth called the ''Ospizio dei cento preti'' (\"Hospice of the Hundred Priests\").<ref name=pie7980/>  \n\nIn the 19th century only a few new building or restoration projects were realized. Among them were the youth prison (Palazzo del Gonfalone) (1825-27), the renovation of the Armenian Hospice next to the [[San Biagio della Pagnotta|church of San Biagio]] (1830), the new fa\u00e7ade of the [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani]] (1853) and above all the [[Collegio Spagnuolo]] (1853).

To string a kendama together, you need a bead (or mini bearing) and a piece of string. The steps to string a kendama together are:\n# Take one end of the string and put it through the little hole in the ''tama'' until the string is coming through the big hole (''ana'').\n# Put the bead on the end of the string coming out of the ''ana'' and tie a knot to lock the bead in.\n# Put the untied end of the string through one of the two holes in the ''sarado''. ('''Note:''' If you want a '''right handed kendama''', hold the ''sarado'' up so that the big cup is on the right side and put the string through the whole that is facing you. If you want a '''left handed kendama,''' make sure the big cup is on the left side and put the string through the hole facing you).\n#Lead the string through the hole in the ''ken''.\n# Tie a knot at that end of the string so the string doesn't slip through the ''ken'' piece.\n# Put the ''sarado'' down on top of the ''ken''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU&t=349s|title=How to Change a Kendama String|last=|publisher=YoTricks|date=October 29, 2015|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA video of this process can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU here][[File:Grips of a kendama.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Ken Grip (top left), Sara Grip (top right), Candle Grip (bottom left), Tama Grip (bottom right)]]\n\n=== Grips ===\nA kendama can be held in numerous types of grips. The grip that a person decides to holds a kendama in depends on what trick that person wants to try and perform. Some of these grips include:\n\n*'''Ken grip:''' Hold the ken with all five fingers with the spike pointing upwards and the big cup (or small cup) facing towards your body\n*'''Sara grip:''' hold the ken by placing your thumb and index finger below the intersection of the ''sarado'' and ''ken''.\n**'''Sara grip (stabilized):''' In addition to the thumb and index finger placement, put your middle and ring finger underneath the small cup or big cup (this depends on which way the ken is facing).\n*'''Tama grip:''' With your fingertips, hold the ball (''tama'') with the hole (''ana'') facing upwards.\n*'''Candle grip:''' Face the ken with the spike pointed downward. Hold the ken with three fingers: index, middle, and the thumb.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== How to Play ==\nThe general concept of kendama is pulling the ''ken'' up and balancing the ''tama'' somewhere on the ''ken'', or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama. However, bending the knees while playing kendama is a method that experts use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ito|first=Mariko|last2=Mishima|first2=Hiroyuki|last3=Sasaki|first3=Masato|date=2011-11-07|title=The Dynamical Stability of Visual Coupling and Knee Flexibility in Skilled Kendama Players|journal=Ecological Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=308\u2013332|doi=10.1080/10407413.2011.617669|issn=1040-7413}}</ref> Endless tricks and trick combinations can be made with just ''ken grip, sara grip, tama grip,'' and ''candle grip'' by themselves or together in a combination.

Later on, some people replaced the deer horn with a piece of bamboo due to deer horn costing too may resources, making the '''bamboo and ball'''. The next model started to resemble what the kendama looks like today: the '''ken and ball'''. This model was a ''ken'' piece strung to the ball.\n\nThe '''jisugetsu ball''' kendama model was the first model made by Ekusa (1919), and later went on to be produced as many as 300,000 times in one year by Hongo woodworking factory in Hatsukaichi (1921). The ''jisugetsu'' has a similar design as lined folk craft kendamas, which were made by factories that also produced [[Kokeshi|Kokeshi dolls]] from [[Lathe|spinning lathe machines]].<ref name=\":3\" /> The strings of both the jisugetsu ball and folk craft kendamas were placed on the ''ken'' using a loose metal fitting, making the string prone to detaching or breaking.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe '''S (Shinma)-Type kendama''' was the first competition style kendama invented in 1975 by Hideo Shinma, the president of the Tokyo Kendama Club.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://kendama.or.jp/english/history/jka-history/|title=JKA History|last=|first=|date=|website=Japan Kendama Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=February 1, 2020|access-date=}}</ref> The first S-type prototype emerged in 1976, and the ''Japan Kendama Association'' (JKA) asked Shinma to make them a competition style model based on the S-Type design in 1977.\n\nThe '''F (Fujiwara)-Type''' '''(F16)''' kendama emerged in 1978, invented by Issei Fujiwara. The F-Type incorporated new modifications unknown to kendamas at the time. The F-Type had two small holes drilled in the middle of each side of the ''sarado'', and also used a sturdier string that was unlikely to break. The two string holes in the ''sarado'' offer more fluidity of play as well as the option to switch the kendama between left handed or right handed.\n\nThe '''Tortoise''' kendama by Tortoise, Inc. was a take on the S-type kendama after the S-type discontinued in '''1990'''. Tortoise kendamas came in different models: the T-8,   T-14, T-16, and T-17. The numbers indicating each different Tortoise model corresponds with the height of each model in centimeters. Tortoise kendamas stopped production in 2012 due to not having enough resources.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe '''F16-2''', the second version of the F16, was released in 2001. The main change in the F16-2 from the F16 is that the position of the string hole was moved slightly off from the cup body's center, enabling the kendama to turn and rotate in a new fluid way. This string hole adjustment is still used in various shapes of kendamas to this day.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Contemporary Culture==\nKendama has increased in popularity since its initial evolution in Japan.

However, all forms of kendama competition are regulated by rules. 4 styles of kendama competition are: speed ladder, open division, freestyle, and Kendama World Cup (KWC). It is rare that the KWC style of competing is used an event other than KWC itself.\n\n=== Speed Ladder ===\nThe '''speed ladder''' is a style of competition is a race of who can finish a set of tricks the fastest. Players will race through an order of tricks that they are given at the event or prior to the event via the internet. The players who finish the trick ladder the fastest wins. There are divisions that sign up to compete in based on their skill level (ex: '''beginner, intermediate,''' and '''advanced/pro''').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sweetskendamas.com/blogs/blog/mko-2016-trick-lists|title=MKO 2016 Trick List|last=Jorgenson|first=Matthew|date=September 9, 2016|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Open Division ===\n'''Open Division''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 competition style format. Each round, 2 players compete against each other and take turns drawing a trick at random. Each trick drawn warrants a maximum of 3 exchanges - the number of times the players can go back and forth attempting the trick. '''The first player to 3 points wins'''.\n\n*If a player completes the trick and the other player misses, the successful player earns 1 point and the other player draws another trick.\n* If both players complete or miss the trick, then the 1st exchange comes to an end and the first player gets another attempt to complete the trick in the 2nd bout, restarting the process. \n** If both players complete or miss the trick in all 3 bouts, then the trick is discarded and the second player draws a new trick\n\n'''Note:''' In the final round, the first player to '''5 points''' wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/amateur-open-division-1|title=Amateur Open Division|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Note:''' The labeled champion of each event is usually referring to the Open Division winner.\n\n=== Freestyle ===\n'''Freestyle''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 style of competition.  Each match is judged by a panel of 3 or 5 judges. The 2 players competing against each other in each round will take turns performing tricks in 45 second time periods twice each. During the time periods, both players may perform any trick that they choose.\n\nEach judge individually decides which player wins based on who did the best in the following 3 categories: ''Creativity, Consistency,'' and ''Difficulty''. The player with the most votes wins the round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/freestyle-registration|title=Freestyle + Open|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== KWC ===\n120 tricks are released online prior to the KWC and are split up into groups of 10 tricks each 12 times, forming a level 1- level 12 trick list. The higher level a trick is, the more difficult it is and the more points it is worth. KWC is split into 2 days of competition: Day 1: Qualifying & Day 2: Finals. Each day has its own set of rules.\n\nDuring '''Day 1''', all players choose 12 tricks from the levels 1-10 in the trick list. Players split the 12 tricks into two rounds of 6 tricks each, and each player will get 3 minutes for each round to complete as many tricks as possible. The 25 players with the highest point scores will advance to Day 2.\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the face value of the level of the trick. (ex. level 6 trick is worth 6 points).\n\nDuring '''Day 2''', the players compete one by one from the lowest scoring qualifying player to the highest scoring qualifying player. Each player has 3 minutes to do an unlimited number of tricks from levels 3-12, and each trick can only be done once. The player who gets the highest number of points in their time period wins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the level of that trick squared (ex. level 6 trick is worth 36 points), with the exception of level 11 tricks (worth 151 points) and level 12 tricks (worth 194 points).\n\n==Competitions==\nKendama competitions have been occurring since 1979, with the first competition being the All Japan Kendama-Do Championships held by the Japan Kendama Association.<ref name=\"Japanese Kendama Association - History\">{{cite web|url=http://kendama.or.jp/information/jka_history/|title=\u3051\u3093\u7389\u5354\u4f1a\u306e\u6cbf\u9769|publisher=}}</ref> The British Kendama Association was the first group to hold a formal kendama contest outside Japan in 2008 at the British Juggling Convention in [[Doncaster]].

The event is currently hosted by Kentucky-based kendama company Sol Kendamas. The event occurs on the first weekend of each January in Tennessee, USA.\n\nJune 2011, the first public Kendama competition (battle) was held in the state of Tennessee. The event occurred in the city of Nashville hosted by a kendama blog called the \"Kensession Stand\". The event was called the \"Nashville Kendama Battle\", and was held at 12th South Taproom. \nIn subsequent years, a group of kendama players called The Kendama Squad (Chad Covington, Nicholas Bellamy, and John Ross Rudolph) -- alongside the Kensession Stand (Tyler Marshall) -- hosted annual kendama battles in Clarksville, Tennessee. While the competition continued to occur annually, the name \"Battle at the Border\" was not implemented until the 2014 competition. In 2015, Sol Kendamas began officially coordinating the event. In 2015, the competition reached its largest attendance (approximately 150 people). Battle at the Border (2015-2016) was held in Nashville, Tennessee on the first weekend of January at Rocketown. Battle at the Border (2017-2018) was held on the first weekend of January at The Foundry in Nashville, TN.

It consists of a handle (''ken''), a pair of cups (''sarado''), and a ball (''tama'') that are all connected together by a string. On one end of the ''ken'' is a cup, while the other end of ''ken'' is narrowed down, forming a spike (''kensaki'') that fits into the hole (''ana'') of the ''tama''. The ''kendama'' is the Japanese version of the classic [[cup-and-ball]] game,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kendama.or.jp/english/about/kendama/|title=Kendama|last=|first=|date=|website=Japan Kendama Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> and is also a variant of the French cup-and-ball game ''bilboquet''. Kendama can be held in different grips, and the tricks and combinations that can be done are limitless.          The principle of these toys are the same: catching one object with another, where both are joined by a string.\n\nThe origins of kendama are disputed, but it is generally believed to have originated during the 17th or 18th century. Kendama started to evolutionize when it came to Japan during the [[Edo period]], and since then the use of the toy has spread throughout the world. The size and materials used to create kendamas now vary as they are offered in jumbo and mini sizes, and have been created out plastic, metal, and nylon. There are now kendama competitions held in countries all over the world, the biggest competition being the annual Kendama World Cup in Japan.\n\n==Structure and Terminology==\n[[File:Kendama Parts Numbered.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Anatomy of kendama]]\nThe ''kendama'' is traditionally made out of wood and comprises the following parts:\n# Main body {{nihongo||\u5263|ken}}.\n# Spike {{nihongo||\u5263\u5148|kensaki}}.\n# Big cup {{nihongo||\u5927\u76bf|\u014dzara}}.\n# Base cup {{nihongo||\u4e2d\u76bf|ch\u016bzara}}.\n# Small cup {{nihongo||\u5c0f\u76bf|kozara}}.\n# Tama  {{nihongo||\u7389|tama}}.\n# Hole {{nihongo||\u7a74|ana}}.\n# String  {{nihongo||\u7cf8|ito}}.\n# Cup body {{nihongo||\u76bf\u80f4|sarad\u014d}}.\n# Small cup edge {{nihongo||\u5c0f\u76bf\u306e\u3075\u3061|kozara no fuchi}}.\n# Big cup for lunars {{nihongo||\u5927\u76bf\u306e\u3075\u3061|\u014dzara no fuchi}}.\n# Slip-stop or slip grip {{nihongo||\u3059\u3079\u308a\u6b62\u3081|suberidome}}.\n# Back end {{nihongo||\u3051\u3093\u3058\u308a|kenjiri}}.\n# String attachment hole {{nihongo||\u7cf8\u53d6\u308a\u4ed8\u3051\u7a74|ito toritsuke ana}}.\n# Bead (not pictured)\n\n=== Stringing a Kendama ===\n\"Stringing\" a kendama is the action of connecting all 3 pieces of the kendama (''ken, sarado,'' and ''tama'') together. To string a kendama together, you need a bead (or mini bearing) and a piece of string. The steps to string a kendama together are:\n# Take one end of the string and put it through the little hole in the ''tama'' until the string is coming through the big hole (''ana'').\n# Put the bead on the end of the string coming out of the ''ana'' and tie a knot to lock the bead in.\n# Put the untied end of the string through one of the two holes in the ''sarado''. ('''Note:''' If you want a '''right handed kendama''', hold the ''sarado'' up so that the big cup is on the right side and put the string through the whole that is facing you. If you want a '''left handed kendama,''' make sure the big cup is on the left side and put the string through the hole facing you).\n#Lead the string through the hole in the ''ken''.\n# Tie a knot at that end of the string so the string doesn't slip through the ''ken'' piece.\n# Put the ''sarado'' down on top of the ''ken''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU&t=349s|title=How to Change a Kendama String|last=|publisher=YoTricks|date=October 29, 2015|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA video of this process can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLy2phiHJU here][[File:Grips of a kendama.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Ken Grip (top left), Sara Grip (top right), Candle Grip (bottom left), Tama Grip (bottom right)]]\n\n=== Grips ===\nA kendama can be held in numerous types of grips. The grip that a person decides to holds a kendama in depends on what trick that person wants to try and perform. Some of these grips include:\n\n*'''Ken grip:''' Hold the ken with all five fingers with the spike pointing upwards and the big cup (or small cup) facing towards your body\n*'''Sara grip:''' hold the ken by placing your thumb and index finger below the intersection of the ''sarado'' and ''ken''.\n**'''Sara grip (stabilized):''' In addition to the thumb and index finger placement, put your middle and ring finger underneath the small cup or big cup (this depends on which way the ken is facing).\n*'''Tama grip:''' With your fingertips, hold the ball (''tama'') with the hole (''ana'') facing upwards.\n*'''Candle grip:''' Face the ken with the spike pointed downward. Hold the ken with three fingers: index, middle, and the thumb.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== How to Play ==\nThe general concept of kendama is pulling the ''ken'' up and balancing the ''tama'' somewhere on the ''ken'', or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama.

Later on, some people replaced the deer horn with a piece of bamboo due to deer horn costing too may resources, making the '''bamboo and ball'''. The next model started to resemble what the kendama looks like today: the '''ken and ball'''. This model was a ''ken'' piece strung to the ball.\n\nThe '''jisugetsu ball''' kendama model was the first model made by Ekusa (1919), and later went on to be produced as many as 300,000 times in one year by Hongo woodworking factory in Hatsukaichi (1921). The ''jisugetsu'' has a similar design as lined folk craft kendamas, which were made by factories that also produced [[Kokeshi|Kokeshi dolls]] from [[Lathe|spinning lathe machines]].<ref name=\":3\" /> The strings of both the jisugetsu ball and folk craft kendamas were placed on the ''ken'' using a loose metal fitting, making the string prone to detaching or breaking.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe '''S (Shinma)-Type kendama''' was the first competition style kendama invented in 1975 by Hideo Shinma, the president of the Tokyo Kendama Club.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://kendama.or.jp/english/history/jka-history/|title=JKA History|last=|first=|date=|website=Japan Kendama Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=February 1, 2020|access-date=}}</ref> The first S-type prototype emerged in 1976, and the ''Japan Kendama Association'' (JKA) asked Shinma to make them a competition style model based on the S-Type design in 1977.\n\nThe '''F (Fujiwara)-Type''' '''(F16)''' kendama emerged in 1978, invented by Issei Fujiwara. The F-Type incorporated new modifications unknown to kendamas at the time. The F-Type had two small holes drilled in the middle of each side of the ''sarado'', and also used a sturdier string that was unlikely to break. The two string holes in the ''sarado'' offer more fluidity of play as well as the option to switch the kendama between left handed or right handed.\n\nThe '''Tortoise''' kendama by Tortoise, Inc. was a take on the S-type kendama after the S-type discontinued in '''1990'''. Tortoise kendamas came in different models: the T-8,   T-14, T-16, and T-17. The numbers indicating each different Tortoise model corresponds with the height of each model in centimeters. Tortoise kendamas stopped production in 2012 due to not having enough resources.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe '''F16-2''', the second version of the F16, was released in 2001. The main change in the F16-2 from the F16 is that the position of the string hole was moved slightly off from the cup body's center, enabling the kendama to turn and rotate in a new fluid way. This string hole adjustment is still used in various shapes of kendamas to this day.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Contemporary Culture==\nKendama has increased in popularity since its initial evolution in Japan. During the 2000s, kendama surged in popularity outside Japan, which influenced the creation of the first kendama companies in foreign countries.\n\nThe first kendama company in the United States was Kendama USA in 2006.<ref name=\"KendamaUSA - About2\">{{cite web|url=http://kendamausa.com/about/|title=What is a Kendama?|publisher=Kendama USA}}</ref> They began to promote kendama in North America and were able to reach the [[winter sports]], [[BMX|bmx]], and [[rollerblading]] communities.

Players will race through an order of tricks that they are given at the event or prior to the event via the internet. The players who finish the trick ladder the fastest wins.

Each round, 2 players compete against each other and take turns drawing a trick at random. Each trick drawn warrants a maximum of 3 exchanges - the number of times the players can go back and forth attempting the trick. '''The first player to 3 points wins'''.\n\n*If a player completes the trick and the other player misses, the successful player earns 1 point and the other player draws another trick.\n* If both players complete or miss the trick, then the 1st exchange comes to an end and the first player gets another attempt to complete the trick in the 2nd bout, restarting the process. \n** If both players complete or miss the trick in all 3 bouts, then the trick is discarded and the second player draws a new trick\n\n'''Note:''' In the final round, the first player to '''5 points''' wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/amateur-open-division-1|title=Amateur Open Division|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Note:''' The labeled champion of each event is usually referring to the Open Division winner.\n\n=== Freestyle ===\n'''Freestyle''' is a head-to-head 1vs1 style of competition.  Each match is judged by a panel of 3 or 5 judges. The 2 players competing against each other in each round will take turns performing tricks in 45 second time periods twice each. During the time periods, both players may perform any trick that they choose.\n\nEach judge individually decides which player wins based on who did the best in the following 3 categories: ''Creativity, Consistency,'' and ''Difficulty''. The player with the most votes wins the round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mnkendamaopen.com/register/freestyle-registration|title=Freestyle + Open|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Sweets Kendamas|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== KWC ===\n120 tricks are released online prior to the KWC and are split up into groups of 10 tricks each 12 times, forming a level 1- level 12 trick list. The higher level a trick is, the more difficult it is and the more points it is worth. KWC is split into 2 days of competition: Day 1: Qualifying & Day 2: Finals. Each day has its own set of rules.\n\nDuring '''Day 1''', all players choose 12 tricks from the levels 1-10 in the trick list. Players split the 12 tricks into two rounds of 6 tricks each, and each player will get 3 minutes for each round to complete as many tricks as possible. The 25 players with the highest point scores will advance to Day 2.\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the face value of the level of the trick. (ex. level 6 trick is worth 6 points).\n\nDuring '''Day 2''', the players compete one by one from the lowest scoring qualifying player to the highest scoring qualifying player. Each player has 3 minutes to do an unlimited number of tricks from levels 3-12, and each trick can only be done once. The player who gets the highest number of points in their time period wins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Note:''' The number of points each trick is worth is equivalent to the level of that trick squared (ex. level 6 trick is worth 36 points), with the exception of level 11 tricks (worth 151 points) and level 12 tricks (worth 194 points).\n\n==Competitions==\nKendama competitions have been occurring since 1979, with the first competition being the All Japan Kendama-Do Championships held by the Japan Kendama Association.<ref name=\"Japanese Kendama Association - History\">{{cite web|url=http://kendama.or.jp/information/jka_history/|title=\u3051\u3093\u7389\u5354\u4f1a\u306e\u6cbf\u9769|publisher=}}</ref> The British Kendama Association was the first group to hold a formal kendama contest outside Japan in 2008 at the British Juggling Convention in [[Doncaster]].

The event is currently hosted by Kentucky-based kendama company Sol Kendamas. The event occurs on the first weekend of each January in Tennessee, USA.\n\nJune 2011, the first public Kendama competition (battle) was held in the state of Tennessee. The event occurred in the city of Nashville hosted by a kendama blog called the \"Kensession Stand\". The event was called the \"Nashville Kendama Battle\", and was held at 12th South Taproom. \nIn subsequent years, a group of kendama players called The Kendama Squad (Chad Covington, Nicholas Bellamy, and John Ross Rudolph) -- alongside the Kensession Stand (Tyler Marshall) -- hosted annual kendama battles in Clarksville, Tennessee. While the competition continued to occur annually, the name \"Battle at the Border\" was not implemented until the 2014 competition. In 2015, Sol Kendamas began officially coordinating the event. In 2015, the competition reached its largest attendance (approximately 150 people). Battle at the Border (2015-2016) was held in Nashville, Tennessee on the first weekend of January at Rocketown. Battle at the Border (2017-2018) was held on the first weekend of January at The Foundry in Nashville, TN.
