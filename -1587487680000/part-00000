It stars Lee, [[Maria Yi]], [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] and [[Tony Liu]]. Originally written for Tien, the leading role was given to Lee instead when the film's original director, Ng Kar-seung, was replaced by Lo. The film was a critical success and excelled at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|title=In Review: The Big Boss on DVD|author=Michael Ewins|date=4 July 2012|work=New Empress Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208142724/http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee's strong performance overshadowed Tien, already a star in Hong Kong, and made Bruce Lee famous in Southeast Asia, and eventually, the world.\n\n==Plot==\nCheng Chao-an (Pronounced \"Cheng Chow-On\") ([[Bruce Lee]]) is a Chinese man who moves to [[Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]], to live with his adopted family and to work in an ice factory. He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs who steal dumplings from Hsu's brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the ice blocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense. The movie ends as the crowd walks back to the police car to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting.<ref name=story>{{cite book| title= The Bruce Lee Story |first1= Linda |last1= Lee | first2= Tom |last2= Bleecker| publisher= Ohara Publications, Inc.| year= 1989 | isbn= }}</ref> Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= Warner Paperback Library| isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=''Bruce Lee the Legend'' |format=1983 Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively titled ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= On The Fly Productions Ltd| year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=story /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong, a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were everywhere, and the tap water in the hotel was yellow.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon |first= John |last= Little| year= 1998| publisher= Tuttle Publishing| isbn= }}</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI />\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the \"uncertain\" original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua).<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a \"fame lover\" and \"another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority\".<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby New Wan Chai Hotel (now the Rimtarninn), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>''In Pursuit of the Dragon'' (2012 documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> \n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /> The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in the Bangkok area was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin /> At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=JKDClub /> before flying to the U.S. the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|''Longstreet'']]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora, who was already in Thailand on vacation, joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside refreshment vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref> It remained the highest-grossing film of all time in Hong Kong until Lee's second film, ''Fist of Fury'', was released in March 1972.\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=confusion>\"Confusion at the Jurong Drive-in\".

It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in [[Beirut]] in 1972 that they began to take notice.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical reception===\n''The Big Boss'' received mixed reviews from critics. From the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' during the film's original Hong Kong run: \"This is probably the biggest thing to hit the Mandarin film business since the invention of fake blood ... Every cinema showing this film is packed to the fire exits.\"<ref name=Southchina>''South China Morning Post''. 7 November 1971.</ref> \n\nIn a positive review for Singapore newspaper ''[[The Straits Times]]'', Arthur Richards wrote, \"It is a delightful study of Chinese martial arts mixed with karate and lightning kicks, Western-style ... An acceptable thriller of the James Bond calibre.\"<ref name=Straits>Richards, Arthur (5 December 1971). \"Fistful of thrills of the 007 calibre\". ''The Straits Times''.</ref>\nConversely, a negative review by Edgar Koh had appeared in another Singapore newspaper, New Nation, a few days earlier: \"Bruce Lee is certainly skilled in his job, not as an actor but as an exponent of his particular brand of fighting with fists and legs ... There are the stereotype good and bad, and the by now redundant theme of revenge. On top of this, it doesn't flow smoothly; the emotional mood, shallow though it is, is sometimes left out on a limb.\"<ref name=Nation>Koh, Edgar (2 December 1971). \"Skilful pugilism but it's repugnant cinema\". ''New Nation''.</ref>\n\nReviews were also mixed when the film was released (as ''Fists of Fury'') in the US in spring 1973. J. Oliver Prescott of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' wrote, \"Bruce Lee is the fastest foot in the East ... Now back in Hong Kong, he has become the hottest international movie star since [[Clint Eastwood]]. Unlike Eastwood\u2019s anti-hero, Bruce Lee is giving the American audiences what they apparently want now: a hero. Lee is Rex Allen, Lash Larue, Tom Mix, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry all rolled into one ... The characters are certainly simple: these are just plain Chinese country folk whose little disagreements develop overnight into Oriental rumbles equivalent to the Sharks and Jets in [[West Side Story]].\"<ref name=Tampa>Prescott, J. Oliver (12 June 1973). ''Tampa Bay Times''.</ref>\n[[Vincent Canby]] of [[The New York Times]] wrote, \"Kung fu movies began as a local phenomenon in Hong Kong a couple of years ago. The two I\u2019ve just seen, ''Fists of Fury'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Boss'') and ''Deep Thrust'' (a.k.a. ''[[Lady Whirlwind]]''), make the worst [[Spaghetti Western|Italian Westerns]] look like the most solemn and noble achievements of the early Soviet cinema.\"<ref name=NYT>Canby, Vincent (13 May 1973). ''The New York Times.</ref> \n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"Despite the silly plot, dreadful supporting cast and prim morality (or perhaps because of them), ''Fists of Fury'' is sometimes entertaining, with most of the credit due to Lee.\"<ref name=Variety>Variety.</ref>\n\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the returning villains. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the original Mandarin language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Cantonese release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Cantonese version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss?

Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;

It stars Lee, [[Maria Yi]], [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] and [[Tony Liu]]. Originally written for Tien, the leading role was given to Lee instead when the film's original director, Ng Kar-seung, was replaced by Lo. The film was a critical success and excelled at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|title=In Review: The Big Boss on DVD|author=Michael Ewins|date=4 July 2012|work=New Empress Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208142724/http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee's strong performance overshadowed Tien, already a star in Hong Kong, and made Bruce Lee famous in Southeast Asia, and eventually, the world.\n\n==Plot==\nCheng Chao-an (Pronounced \"Cheng Chow-On\") ([[Bruce Lee]]) is a Chinese man who moves to [[Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]], to live with his adopted family and to work in an ice factory. He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs who steal dumplings from Hsu's brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the ice blocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense. The movie ends as the crowd walks back to the police car to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting.<ref name=story>{{cite book| title= The Bruce Lee Story |first1= Linda |last1= Lee | first2= Tom |last2= Bleecker| publisher= Ohara Publications, Inc.| year= 1989 | isbn= }}</ref> Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= Warner Paperback Library| isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=''Bruce Lee the Legend'' |format=1983 Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively titled ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= On The Fly Productions Ltd| year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=story /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong, a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were everywhere, and the tap water in the hotel was yellow.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon |first= John |last= Little| year= 1998| publisher= Tuttle Publishing| isbn= }}</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI />\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the \"uncertain\" original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua).<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a \"fame lover\" and \"another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority\".<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby New Wan Chai Hotel (now the Rimtarninn), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>''In Pursuit of the Dragon'' (2012 documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> \n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /> The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in the Bangkok area was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin /> At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=JKDClub /> before flying to the U.S. the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|''Longstreet'']]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora, who was already in Thailand on vacation, joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside refreshment vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night.

The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref> It remained the highest-grossing film of all time in Hong Kong until Lee's second film, ''Fist of Fury'', was released in March 1972.\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=confusion>\"Confusion at the Jurong Drive-in\".

It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in [[Beirut]] in 1972 that they began to take notice.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe Big Boss received mixed reviews from critics. From the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' during the film's original Hong Kong run: \"This is probably the biggest thing to hit the Mandarin film business since the invention of fake blood ... Every cinema showing this film is packed to the fire exits.\"<ref name=Southchina>''South China Morning Post''. 7 November 1971.</ref> \n\nIn a positive review for Singapore newspaper ''[[The Straits Times]]'', Arthur Richards wrote, \"It is a delightful study of Chinese martial arts mixed with karate and lightning kicks, Western-style ... An acceptable thriller of the James Bond calibre.\"<ref name=Straits>Richards, Arthur (5 December 1971). \"Fistful of thrills of the 007 calibre\". ''The Straits Times''.</ref>\nConversely, a negative review by Edgar Koh had appeared in another Singapore newspaper, New Nation, a few days earlier: \"Bruce Lee is certainly skilled in his job, not as an actor but as an exponent of his particular brand of fighting with fists and legs ... There are the stereotype good and bad, and the by now redundant theme of revenge. On top of this, it doesn't flow smoothly; the emotional mood, shallow though it is, is sometimes left out on a limb.\"<ref name=Nation>Koh, Edgar (2 December 1971). \"Skilful pugilism but it's repugnant cinema\". ''New Nation''.</ref>\n\nReviews were also mixed when the film was released (as ''Fists of Fury'') in the US in spring 1973. J. Oliver Prescott of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' wrote, \"Bruce Lee is the fastest foot in the East ... Now back in Hong Kong, he has become the hottest international movie star since [[Clint Eastwood]]. Unlike Eastwood\u2019s anti-hero, Bruce Lee is giving the American audiences what they apparently want now: a hero. Lee is Rex Allen, Lash Larue, Tom Mix, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry all rolled into one ... The characters are certainly simple: these are just plain Chinese country folk whose little disagreements develop overnight into Oriental rumbles equivalent to the Sharks and Jets in [[West Side Story]].\"<ref name=Tampa>Prescott, J. Oliver (12 June 1973). ''Tampa Bay Times''.</ref>\n[[Vincent Canby]] of [[The New York Times]] wrote, \"Kung fu movies began as a local phenomenon in Hong Kong a couple of years ago. The two I\u2019ve just seen, ''Fists of Fury'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Boss'') and ''Deep Thrust'' (a.k.a. [[Lady Whirlwind]]), make the worst [[Spaghetti Western|Italian Westerns]] look like the most solemn and noble achievements of the early Soviet cinema.\"<ref name=NYT>Canby, Vincent (13 May 1973). ''The New York Times.</ref> \n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"Despite the silly plot, dreadful supporting cast and prim morality (or perhaps because of them), Fists of Fury is sometimes entertaining, with most of the credit due to Lee.\"<ref name=Variety>Variety.</ref>\n\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the returning villains. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the original Mandarin language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Cantonese release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Cantonese version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss?

Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics.

Uppers is less consistent, but it has the potential to be a good wave with a long ride.  North of Uppers is Cotton's Point, the location of former President [[Richard Nixon]]'s home, ''[[La Casa Pacifica]]'', aka ''\"The Western White House\"'', and the associated surfing spot of Cottons.\n\n==Access and amenities==\nGetting to Trestles is a trek.\n\n#Visitors can park and walk down an asphalt trail to Trestles from the trailhead at Cristianitos Road, near where Cristianitos crosses over the San Diego Freeway. Visitors can expect to see surf graffiti on the sidewalk, with such phrases as \"no kooks\", \"surf hard\", \"you're going the wrong way\",  and \"duckbutter\". There is a pay parking lot near the Carl's Jr. restaurant on Coast Highway at Cristianitos, along with some public parking on streets near the restaurant. There is no fee to walk, skateboard, or bike into Trestles by means of this trail. Most visitors enter Trestle by this trail.  It's about a 15-minute walk from the parking lot to the beach.\n#Visitors can park at San Onofre State Beach by exiting the San Diego Freeway at Basilone Road, then heading westerly from the freeway exit to the entrance to the portion of San Onofre State Beach named Surf Beach. The hike northwest to Trestles from Surf Beach at San Onofre State Beach is considerably longer than the hike southwest from the Cristianitos Road bridge and the San Diego Freeway. There is a fee to drive into the State Park at Surf Beach.\n\n==Plant and animal life==\n[[File:Brown Pelican Trestles Park.jpg|thumb|left|A California brown pelican at Trestles park.]]\nTrestles park is home to a variety of plant and animal life. The most common plant is the [[coastal sage scrub]], which is native to the coast of California and thrives in the area's Mediterranean climate. Trestles park is also home to quite a lot of animal life,  including [[California brown pelican]]s. These animals used to be endangered species, but the populations recovered so well that the species was removed from the endangered species list in 2009. During times of heavy rains, there is usually a river delta flowing into the ocean where there are often [[tadpoles]].\n\nOne plant which grows right out of the sand is the [[beach evening primrose]]. Each plants creates a large mat of roots and foliage which is an extremely important aspect of the ecosystem, because other plants are able to grow from the stable surface this plants provides. The primrose can be identified by its bright yellow, four petaled flowers which open in the morning, and turn reddish as evening progresses. The primrose has unique medical benefits as well. These flowers aid in the treatment of sore throat and eye diseases.<ref name=\"Practical and Medical Uses of the Beach Evening Primrose\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=OEDR |title=Practical and Medical Uses of the Beach Evening Primrose |accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Seasonal stream==\nDuring periods of strong rain, Trestles park has a stream that runs through its center and empties into the ocean.<ref name=\"California Rainy Seasons Chart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/media_resources/fact_calirain.jsp |title=California Rainy Season Chart |accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref> Usually you find the stream flowing during winter, and spring which are the seasons with the most rain in Southern California. The stream does not usually contain much animal life, as it dries up fairly quickly without a steady water source. The stream does create a small pool which contains mainly [[tadpoles]]. When the stream dries up above ground, an underground water flow still exits into the ocean, just not through a river delta.

Visitors can expect to see surf graffiti on the sidewalk, with such phrases as \"no kooks\", \"surf hard\", \"you're going the wrong way\",  and \"duckbutter\". There is a pay parking lot near the Carl's Jr. restaurant on Coast Highway at Cristianitos, along with some public parking on streets near the restaurant. There is no fee to walk, skateboard, or bike into Trestles by means of this trail. Most visitors enter Trestle by this trail.  It's about a 15-minute walk from the parking lot to the beach.\n#Visitors can park at San Onofre State Beach by exiting the San Diego Freeway at Basilone Road, then heading westerly from the freeway exit to the entrance to the portion of San Onofre State Beach named Surf Beach. The hike northwest to Trestles from Surf Beach at San Onofre State Beach is considerably longer than the hike southwest from the Cristianitos Road bridge and the San Diego Freeway. There is a fee to drive into the State Park at Surf Beach.\n\n==Plant and animal life==\n[[File:Brown Pelican Trestles Park.jpg|thumb|left|A California brown pelican at Trestles park.]]\nTrestles park is home to a variety of plant and animal life. The most common plant is the [[coastal sage scrub]], which is native to the coast of California and thrives in the area's Mediterranean climate. Trestles park is also home to quite a lot of animal life,  including [[California brown pelican]]s. These animals used to be endangered species, but the populations recovered so well that the species was removed from the endangered species list in 2009. During times of heavy rains, there is usually a river delta flowing into the ocean where there are often [[tadpoles]].\n\nOne plant which grows right out of the sand is the [[beach evening primrose]]. Each plants creates a large mat of roots and foliage which is an extremely important aspect of the ecosystem, because other plants are able to grow from the stable surface this plants provides. The primrose can be identified by its bright yellow, four petaled flowers which open in the morning, and turn reddish as evening progresses. The primrose has unique medical benefits as well. These flowers aid in the treatment of sore throat and eye diseases.<ref name=\"Practical and Medical Uses of the Beach Evening Primrose\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=OEDR |title=Practical and Medical Uses of the Beach Evening Primrose |accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Seasonal stream==\nDuring periods of strong rain, Trestles park has a stream that runs through its center and empties into the ocean.<ref name=\"California Rainy Seasons Chart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/media_resources/fact_calirain.jsp |title=California Rainy Season Chart |accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref> Usually you find the stream flowing during winter, and spring which are the seasons with the most rain in Southern California. The stream does not usually contain much animal life, as it dries up fairly quickly without a steady water source. The stream does create a small pool which contains mainly [[tadpoles]]. When the stream dries up above ground, an underground water flow still exits into the ocean, just not through a river delta. It is an interesting phenomenon to see the river drain from under the sand into the ocean.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Litter in Trestles Park.jpg|thumb|alt=A picture of trash thrown in the dried stream at trestles.|Some trash thrown in the dried stream bed at Trestles]] -->\n\nOne significant problem is littering.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]].

Danny and Ward Meachum\u2014who runs Danny's company\u2014meet with Ward's sister Joy, who asks for them to buy her out of the company; Danny agrees.

Ward believes that someone at his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings is working for Joy, and becomes paranoid. He ultimately does not come to the dinner. Joy and Davos feign niceties until Colleen demands that they discuss their grievances with Danny. Davos finds the surveillance photos, which he and Joy had arranged to be taken, and the pair leave. Danny and Colleen come to a parlay between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets, now represented by Mrs. Yang.

Danny and Colleen are met by Detective [[Misty Knight]], a friend who Danny gave a robotic arm to after she lost hers fighting the Hand. Misty explains that the trap Danny had seen was actually police officers watching the parlay, and asks Danny to stay away from now on. He instead goes to the docks on his own, but Davos has already killed the Golden Tiger soldiers there and taken what he wanted: the tattooed skin from the corpse of an old Iron Fist.

Joy begins to fear what Davos may do to her, and hires Walker for protection. One of the kids holding Danny, BB\u2014who Colleen had run into several times before\u2014is convinced by Danny to call Colleen.

After explaining that they are accessories to a crime, Misty gets the Crane Sisters to agree to reversing the ritual. Walker reveals to Danny that she actually plans to kill Davos before running away to live in a secluded cabin in peace. This would allow her to avoid any of the triggers that bring Mary to the surface. Danny convinces her to take Davos hostage instead, and when he returns from his killing spree across the city Davos is subdued. He manages to break Danny's leg before falling unconscious.

In addition to continuing his killing spree, Davos recruits the gang of local kids and plans to train them as soldiers to help fight his war against crime in New York City. Danny also wants to begin training again, hoping that Colleen will re-open her dojo for teaching. She does not want to take the responsibility for a student who could fight and die, but eventually relents and begins training Danny to fight with his injury. Misty learns the requirements of the ritual from Prada, and goes in search of more help. Ward turns to alcohol to drown his sorrows, despite the protests of Bethany.

Joy attempts to undermine Davos by searching for the bowl, and asks Ward to take over a business venture that she is carrying out in the memory of their mother. He worries that she is in danger, and Walker agrees to help him kill Davos. BB helps Joy steal the bowl, while Davos unsuccessfully tries to convince the wider community of the nobility of his crusade. The remnants of the triads band together to stop him, and all Danny can do is try and stop him first.

BB contacts the rest of his gang, hoping that they will see reason, but they tell Davos that he has gone to a community center where Colleen volunteers. Danny and Colleen go to the center to stop the combined triads from mobilizing to attack, but Davos and his gang arrive. BB faces his gang, and is killed.

With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. Colleen prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as the new Iron Fist, while Joy attempts to return to her normal life. Walker, considering the possibility of having another, more violent identity, decides to stay affiliated with Joy and her influence. Ward attempts to reconcile with Bethany, but she chooses to raise their child on her own.

Metzner pitched a story for the season that excited Marvel, and Loeb compared the change to a new writer taking over on a comic.<ref name=\"NewShowrunnerExplanation\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season begins after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and sees Rand fulfill his promise to protect New York following the supposed death of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] at the end of that miniseries. For the season, Metzner also wanted to explore more of the mythology of [[K'un-Lun]] than was shown in the first season by spending more time there.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in,<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\" /> after the first season named each episode after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"S1EpTitlesKungFu\" />\n\nWhen asked how the season would be influenced by the criticisms of the first, Metzner said that Marvel had allowed him to tell his own story rather than follow on from the first season and so he just approached the project as a fan of the comics and characters. He described the second season as an \"evolution\" of the first.<ref name=\"MetznerS1Criticisms\" /> Jones felt that Rand would be more relatable for the audience in the second season after moving in with his girlfriend and spending less time around Rand Enterprises. Metzner described this approach as \"[[holistic]]\", wanting the series to feel like being on the streets of New York.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Finn Jones]], [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] reprise their roles as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Ward Meachum]], [[Joy Meachum]], and [[Steel Serpent|Davos]], respectively. They are joined in the season by [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].<ref name=\"EveCast\" /><ref name=\"TyphoidMary\" /> Metzner had previously written a different version of Typhoid Mary for the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), and was always interested in that character and well-versed in her comic story. Eve described her introduction in the season as an origin story that explores the mystery of the character's multiple personalities, while Loeb said, \"We meet her at a certain point in her life and then cards get tipped over as you go.\"<ref name=\"EveCBRAug2018\" />\n\nWith the announcement of the season, it was revealed that [[Simone Missick]] would appear, reprising her role as [[Misty Knight]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|MCU Netflix series]].<ref name=\"S2Announce\" /> This allows for the exploration of the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] team that Wing and Knight form in the comics.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> [[James C. Chen|James Chen]] had also joined the cast as Sam Chung, a role loosely based on the comics supporting character of the [[Blindspot (Sam Chung)|same name]].<ref name=\"SamChung\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season was expected to begin \"soon\" after it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"FilmingSoon\" /> with actor [[Sacha Dhawan]] saying then that \"they're hopefully starting\" by December 2017.<ref name=\"DhawanFilming\" /> By December 13, filming on the season had begun,<ref name=\"FilmingBegin\" /> in New York City where the production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 10, 2018. Jones described this as the end of a \"long and physical 7 month winter shoot\".<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" /> Extensive filming took place in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Niels Alpert served as cinematographer for the season.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\nClayton Barber took over as the fight coordinator for the season, having also served in the role on Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018),<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> after the fight choreography of the first season was widely criticized. Barber was inspired by \"old school kung fu\" such as the works of [[Jackie Chan]], and wanted to make the fights of the series feel like \"a punk rock song\".<ref name=\"BarberSDCC\" /><ref name=\"BarberSDCCVid\" /> Metzner noted that Jones had months of lead time before work on the season began to \"hone his skills\" with the fighting and stunts, and said that he and the rest of the cast along with Barber \"really pushed themselves\" with the fight sequences in the season. Jones added that all of the fight scenes have \"an emotional standpoint\" so that they drive the story forward rather than simply being \"awesome fight scenes\" for the sake of having fights.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesFightsSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Music===\nRobert Lydecker composed the music for the season.<ref name=\"Lydecker\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe fictional country of Sokovia that was introduced in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) is referenced in the season as part of Walker's past as an operative in the country.<ref name=\"AoU\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Iron Fist'', consisting of ten episodes,<ref name=\"IFS2Episodes\" /> was released on September 7, 2018, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nJones, Henwick, Missick, Eve, Loeb, Metzner, and Barber promoted the season at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[io9]] felt the footage shown at the panel left him optimistic for the season, since \"It finally feels like ''Iron Fist'' may have figured out what people wanted out of this show in the first place.\" He felt the clips showed \"how drastic an improvement\" there was to the fight choreography, thanks in part to new fight coordinator Barber joining the series. One clip that showed Rand facing Davos in K'un-Lun felt \"brutal and bloody\" while also being \"fluid and elegant in a way that feels fresh, new, and {{em|exactly}} like what you want from ''Iron Fist''.\"<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> At the panel, Loeb appeared in a karate costume, as part of a comedic bit with Henwick, who later appeared on stage telling Loeb to remove the outfit. Some criticized the outfit as insensitive and \"several layers of bad\".<ref name=\"TeenVogueLoebOutfit\" /><ref name=\"BuzzFeedLoebOutfit\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 57% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Better action scenes and tighter pacing elevate ''Iron Fist''{{'}}s second season, but it remains a lesser light among MCU shows.\"<ref>{{cite web

name]], follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Raven Metzner]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, who protects New York following the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''. [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] also return from the [[Iron Fist (season 1)|first season]] to star, and are joined by [[Simone Missick]], reprising her role from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix series]], and [[Alice Eve]]. The season was ordered in July 2017, with Metzner replacing [[Scott Buck]] as showrunner. Filming for the season began in late 2017 in New York City, and continued until May 2018. Focus was placed on improving the fight sequences for the series after [[Iron Fist (season 1)#Fight scene criticisms|criticisms of the first season]], with Clayton Barber taking over as fight coordinator after doing so for the MCU film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''. Each episode in the season is named after a comics issue that Rand has appeared in.\n\nThe season was released on September 7, 2018, and consists of ten episodes. The season received mixed reviews from critics, but was considered a major improvement over the previous season.

Colleen finds a box bearing the [[Kamon (crest)|kamon]] of her family, who pushed her away years earlier. She begins investigating where the box may have come from, and comes to believe that furniture shop owner Frank Choi may know of its origin. He goes missing when he is unable to pay the Golden Tigers for protection. Danny and Ward Meachum\u2014who runs Danny's company\u2014meet with Ward's sister Joy, who asks for them to buy her out of the company; Danny agrees. Joy is working with Davos, who was raised with Danny in the mystical city of [[K'un-Lun]]. Davos confronts Danny, revealing that he has discovered a way to take the Iron Fist from Danny.

Now, fighting between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets escalates and Danny is unable to convince Hai-Qing Yang, the leader of the Hatchets, to look for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. On the streets, Danny meets a strange newcomer to the city, [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Mary]], and helps her by giving her directions and trying to protect her from the gang violence.

Despite Davos's protests, Joy agrees to avoid suspicion. Mary leaves a set of surveillance photos showing Danny and Colleen at the dojo, and when Danny confronts her about them Mary says that they are being watched by someone named Walker. Ward believes that someone at his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings is working for Joy, and becomes paranoid. He ultimately does not come to the dinner. Joy and Davos feign niceties until Colleen demands that they discuss their grievances with Danny. Davos finds the surveillance photos, which he and Joy had arranged to be taken, and the pair leave. Danny and Colleen come to a parlay between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets, now represented by Mrs. Yang. Negotiations appear successful, but Danny believes that the Golden Tigers have set a trap and attacks them. Mrs. Yang escapes with Colleen.

Danny attempts to reignite peace talks between the triads, but the Golden Tigers have already seized the docks and the Hatchets are preparing to fight back. Danny visits Hai-Qing and realizes that Davos had caused the stroke. Hai-Qing is able to tell Danny what Davos was having brought in at the docks. Danny and Colleen are met by Detective [[Misty Knight]], a friend who Danny gave a robotic arm to after she lost hers fighting the Hand. Misty explains that the trap Danny had seen was actually police officers watching the parlay, and asks Danny to stay away from now on. He instead goes to the docks on his own, but Davos has already killed the Golden Tiger soldiers there and taken what he wanted: the tattooed skin from the corpse of an old Iron Fist. Danny is attacked, drugged, and taken by Walker to the site of a ritual in which the bowl, skin, and Danny's blood are used to transfer the power of the Iron Fist to Davos.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Heart of the Dragon\n |DirectedBy = [[Mairzee Almas]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Declan de Barra]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Bleeding out, Danny is found by a group of local kids who have started their own triad. They plan to give Danny to the Golden Tigers in exchange for a bounty. Colleen and Misty attempt to find Danny by tracking down Walker, and get Ward's help to quickly run a fingerprint search on the surveillance photos. Davos looks to become the Iron Fist that Danny never was, starting with ending the triad war himself. He goes to a nightclub owned by the Golden Tigers and kills their leadership. Joy begins to fear what Davos may do to her, and hires Walker for protection. One of the kids holding Danny, BB\u2014who Colleen had run into several times before\u2014is convinced by Danny to call Colleen. She and Misty find Danny, and Ward gets his NA sponsor Bethany to tend to Danny's injuries. While Ward stays with Danny, Colleen and Misty go to ensure that Joy is safe and find her with Walker.

Hoping that they can reverse the process, Colleen and Misty go to find them leaving Ward to watch over Danny, Joy, and Walker. Walker agrees to take Danny back to where the ritual took place to confront Davos, leaving Ward and Joy to discuss their relationship. Joy refuses to forgive Ward and leaves him. After explaining that they are accessories to a crime, Misty gets the Crane Sisters to agree to reversing the ritual. Walker reveals to Danny that she actually plans to kill Davos before running away to live in a secluded cabin in peace. This would allow her to avoid any of the triggers that bring Mary to the surface. Danny convinces her to take Davos hostage instead, and when he returns from his killing spree across the city Davos is subdued. He manages to break Danny's leg before falling unconscious. Walker calls an ambulance for Danny, but Davos is left behind when Mary is triggered and runs away after hearing that Walker plans to keep her trapped.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Morning of the Mindstorm\n |DirectedBy = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy = Rebecca Dameron\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = With the help of a state-of-the-art leg brace, Danny begins to recover from his injury but is unable to fight. Misty hopes to gain the help of the local police precinct to stop Davos, but Captain William Pike is unwilling to do so since Davos is putting an end to organised crime in the neighborhood. In addition to continuing his killing spree, Davos recruits the gang of local kids and plans to train them as soldiers to help fight his war against crime in New York City. Danny also wants to begin training again, hoping that Colleen will re-open her dojo for teaching. She does not want to take the responsibility for a student who could fight and die, but eventually relents and begins training Danny to fight with his injury. Misty learns the requirements of the ritual from Prada, and goes in search of more help. Ward turns to alcohol to drown his sorrows, despite the protests of Bethany. Ward later hears her reveal in an NA meeting that she is pregnant with his child. Joy visits Mary, who realizes that she is protected by Walker.

Walker always believed that it was Mary who broke them out, and psychiatrist Paul Edmonds suggests that they may have another alternate personality; Walker dismisses this idea. Joy attempts to undermine Davos by searching for the bowl, and asks Ward to take over a business venture that she is carrying out in the memory of their mother. He worries that she is in danger, and Walker agrees to help him kill Davos. BB helps Joy steal the bowl, while Davos unsuccessfully tries to convince the wider community of the nobility of his crusade. The remnants of the triads band together to stop him, and all Danny can do is try and stop him first. Colleen tries to teach Danny to overcome his emotional bond to Davos, allowing him to realize the negative impact on his life that the Iron Fist has had. Danny suggests that Colleen should take the power from Davos.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = War Without End\n |DirectedBy = Sanford Bookstaver\n |WrittenBy = Daniel Shattuck\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Colleen refuses to take the power of the Iron Fist. Misty returns with a police taskforce ready to capture Davos, as well as Frank Choi who had cut a deal to turn on the Golden Tigers. From Choi's information, Colleen deduces that her mother came to New York and could still be in the city. Davos discovers the missing bowl, and critically injures Joy by pushing her off a balcony. BB contacts the rest of his gang, hoping that they will see reason, but they tell Davos that he has gone to a community center where Colleen volunteers. Danny and Colleen go to the center to stop the combined triads from mobilizing to attack, but Davos and his gang arrive. BB faces his gang, and is killed. Colleen fights the rest off until Misty and the police can arrive. Danny overpowers Davos, and meets the Crane Sisters at the dojo to undertake the ritual again.

Walker waits for Davos to return and attempts to kill him, but Danny warns that killing Davos will kill Colleen as well until the ritual is complete. Misty wakes up, escapes capture, and helps Danny stop Walker by triggering Mary. Colleen fights Davos, and is able to draw the rest of the Iron Fist power out of him. With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. Colleen prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as the new Iron Fist, while Joy attempts to return to her normal life. Walker, considering the possibility of having another, more violent identity, decides to stay affiliated with Joy and her influence. Ward attempts to reconcile with Bethany, but she chooses to raise their child on her own. Danny decides to leave New York to find [[Orson Randall]], the man from whom Davos acquired the Iron Fist corpse.

Metzner pitched a story for the season that excited Marvel, and Loeb compared the change to a new writer taking over on a comic.<ref name=\"NewShowrunnerExplanation\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season begins after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and sees Rand fulfill his promise to protect New York following the supposed death of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] at the end of that miniseries. For the season, Metzner also wanted to explore more of the mythology of [[K'un-Lun]] than was shown in the first season by spending more time there.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in,<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\" /> after the first season named each episode after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"S1EpTitlesKungFu\" />\n\nWhen asked how the season would be influenced by the criticisms of the first, Metzner said that Marvel had allowed him to tell his own story rather than follow on from the first season and so he just approached the project as a fan of the comics and characters. He described the second season as an \"evolution\" of the first.<ref name=\"MetznerS1Criticisms\" /> Jones felt that Rand would be more relatable for the audience in the second season after moving in with his girlfriend and spending less time around Rand Enterprises. Metzner described this approach as \"[[holistic]]\", wanting the series to feel like being on the streets of New York.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Finn Jones]], [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] reprise their roles as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Ward Meachum]], [[Joy Meachum]], and [[Steel Serpent|Davos]], respectively. They are joined in the season by [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].<ref name=\"EveCast\" /><ref name=\"TyphoidMary\" /> Metzner had previously written a different version of Typhoid Mary for the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), and was always interested in that character and well-versed in her comic story. Eve described her introduction in the season as an origin story that explores the mystery of the character's multiple personalities, while Loeb said, \"We meet her at a certain point in her life and then cards get tipped over as you go.\"<ref name=\"EveCBRAug2018\" />\n\nWith the announcement of the season, it was revealed that [[Simone Missick]] would appear, reprising her role as [[Misty Knight]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|MCU Netflix series]].<ref name=\"S2Announce\" /> This allows for the exploration of the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] team that Wing and Knight form in the comics.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> [[James C. Chen|James Chen]] had also joined the cast as Sam Chung, a role loosely based on the comics supporting character of the [[Blindspot (Sam Chung)|same name]].<ref name=\"SamChung\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season was expected to begin \"soon\" after it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"FilmingSoon\" /> with actor [[Sacha Dhawan]] saying then that \"they're hopefully starting\" by December 2017.<ref name=\"DhawanFilming\" /> By December 13, filming on the season had begun,<ref name=\"FilmingBegin\" /> in New York City where the production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 10, 2018. Jones described this as the end of a \"long and physical 7 month winter shoot\".<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" /> Extensive filming took place in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Niels Alpert served as cinematographer for the season.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\nClayton Barber took over as the fight coordinator for the season, having also served in the role on Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018),<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> after the fight choreography of the first season was widely criticized. Barber was inspired by \"old school kung fu\" such as the works of [[Jackie Chan]], and wanted to make the fights of the series feel like \"a punk rock song\".<ref name=\"BarberSDCC\" /><ref name=\"BarberSDCCVid\" /> Metzner noted that Jones had months of lead time before work on the season began to \"hone his skills\" with the fighting and stunts, and said that he and the rest of the cast along with Barber \"really pushed themselves\" with the fight sequences in the season. Jones added that all of the fight scenes have \"an emotional standpoint\" so that they drive the story forward rather than simply being \"awesome fight scenes\" for the sake of having fights.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesFightsSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Music===\nRobert Lydecker composed the music for the season.<ref name=\"Lydecker\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe fictional country of Sokovia that was introduced in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) is referenced in the season as part of Walker's past as an operative in the country.<ref name=\"AoU\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Iron Fist'', consisting of ten episodes,<ref name=\"IFS2Episodes\" /> was released on September 7, 2018, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nJones, Henwick, Missick, Eve, Loeb, Metzner, and Barber promoted the season at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[io9]] felt the footage shown at the panel left him optimistic for the season, since \"It finally feels like ''Iron Fist'' may have figured out what people wanted out of this show in the first place.\" He felt the clips showed \"how drastic an improvement\" there was to the fight choreography, thanks in part to new fight coordinator Barber joining the series. One clip that showed Rand facing Davos in K'un-Lun felt \"brutal and bloody\" while also being \"fluid and elegant in a way that feels fresh, new, and {{em|exactly}} like what you want from ''Iron Fist''.\"<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> At the panel, Loeb appeared in a karate costume, as part of a comedic bit with Henwick, who later appeared on stage telling Loeb to remove the outfit. Some criticized the outfit as insensitive and \"several layers of bad\".<ref name=\"TeenVogueLoebOutfit\" /><ref name=\"BuzzFeedLoebOutfit\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 57% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Better action scenes and tighter pacing elevate ''Iron Fist''{{'}}s second season, but it remains a lesser light among MCU shows.\"<ref>{{cite web

Whilst the show continued to be praised for its charm, witty writing and the cast's performances, criticism grew in these seasons, particularly from reviewers such as [[The A.V. Club]].\n\nIn January 2018, Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd announced that season 10 would most likely be the final season, during the [[Television Critics Association]]'s winter press tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/modern-family-showrunners-on-series-finale/|title=Modern Family Showrunners Are Already Plotting the Series Finale \u2014 and It's Soon!|date=January 10, 2018|work=TVGuide.com|access-date=January 11, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110225400/http://www.tvguide.com/news/modern-family-showrunners-on-series-finale/|archive-date=January 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in August 2018, reports indicated that ABC was in discussions to renew the series for a potential eleventh season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/modern-family-abc-in-talks-for-season-11-of-comedy-series-tca-1202442138/|title='Modern Family': ABC In Talks For Season 11 Of Comedy Series \u2013 TCA|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=August 8, 2018|publisher=|access-date=August 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916103311/https://deadline.com/2018/08/modern-family-abc-in-talks-for-season-11-of-comedy-series-tca-1202442138/|archive-date=September 16, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeason 10 received positive reviews from critics, with many citing the series a major improvement over the last two. The series was praised for its tackling of Haley's pregnancy, the humor of Mitch and Cam looking after Cal, and its dealing with change in positive way. Episodes 'Torn Between Two Lovers', 'Good Grief, and 'A Year Of Birthdays' were particularly praised.\n\nThe series was renewed for an eleventh season on January 7, 2019, which was confirmed as the final season on February 5. The last season premiered on September 25, 2019, and aired its last episode on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/02/05/abc-comedy-modern-family-end-2020-final-season/2778039002/|title=Hit comedy 'Modern Family' to end in 2020 after 11 seasons on ABC|date=February 5, 2019|work=USA Today|access-date=February 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716144150/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/02/05/abc-comedy-modern-family-end-2020-final-season/2778039002/|archive-date=July 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"September 25, 2019\"/>\n\nSeason 11 similarly received mainly positive reviews. The season was praised for its themes of change and ending, and the improved humor upon the last seasons, with particular attention to episodes 'The Prescott', 'Legacy', 'Spuds' and 'Finale'.\n\nModern Family's final episode, [[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]], aired on April 8, 2020, and received a B+ grade from Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club, citing 'there's something that's satisfying in just how low-key it is. The finale doesn't necessarily shoot for outsized emotions. Instead, it makes things personal. It's a finale that suits ''Modern Family'' as it is in 2020; a show that's settled into old age. This is a finale that's both tidy and unfinished, and that feels just right'. The episode was praised by critics and fans alike, particularly for the humour in Claire and Mitchell's ice skating scene, Mitchell and Cam's karaoke scene and The Dunphy children's final joke on Luke, with TV Fanatic saying, 'one of the highlights of the episode were the scenes between Haley, Alex and Luke'. The episode's message of 'leaving a porch light on' was also praised, with fans and critics expressing the highly emotional nature of this ending note.\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Modern Family}}\n[[File:Sof\u00eda Vergara at the 69th Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|thumb|Sof\u00eda Vergara with the award for ''Modern Family'' at the 69th Annual Peabody Awards]]\n''Modern Family'' has won 22 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 6 [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s.

Club]].\n\nIn January 2018, Steve Levitan and Christopher Lloyd announced that season 10 would most likely be the final season, during the [[Television Critics Association]]'s winter press tour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/modern-family-showrunners-on-series-finale/|title=Modern Family Showrunners Are Already Plotting the Series Finale \u2014 and It's Soon!|date=January 10, 2018|work=TVGuide.com|access-date=January 11, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110225400/http://www.tvguide.com/news/modern-family-showrunners-on-series-finale/|archive-date=January 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in August 2018, reports indicated that ABC was in discussions to renew the series for a potential eleventh season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/modern-family-abc-in-talks-for-season-11-of-comedy-series-tca-1202442138/|title='Modern Family': ABC In Talks For Season 11 Of Comedy Series \u2013 TCA|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=August 8, 2018|publisher=|access-date=August 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916103311/https://deadline.com/2018/08/modern-family-abc-in-talks-for-season-11-of-comedy-series-tca-1202442138/|archive-date=September 16, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeason 10 received positive reviews from critics, with many citing the series a major improvement over the last two. The series was praised for its tackling of Haley's pregnancy, the humor of Mitch and Cam looking after Cal, and its dealing with change in positive way. Episodes 'Torn Between Two Lovers', 'Good Grief, and 'A Year Of Birthdays' were particularly praised.\n\nThe series was renewed for an eleventh season on January 7, 2019, which was confirmed as the final season on February 5. The last season premiered on September 25, 2019, and aired its last episode on April 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/02/05/abc-comedy-modern-family-end-2020-final-season/2778039002/|title=Hit comedy 'Modern Family' to end in 2020 after 11 seasons on ABC|date=February 5, 2019|work=USA Today|access-date=February 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716144150/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/02/05/abc-comedy-modern-family-end-2020-final-season/2778039002/|archive-date=July 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"September 25, 2019\"/>\n\nSeason 11 similarly received mainly positive reviews. The season was praised for its themes of change and ending, and the improved humor upon the last seasons, with particular attention to episodes 'The Prescott', 'Legacy', 'Spuds' and 'Finale'.\n\nModern Family's final episode, [[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]], aired on April 8, 2020, and received a B+ grade from Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club, citing 'there's something that's satisfying in just how low-key it is. The finale doesn't necessarily shoot for outsized emotions. Instead, it makes things personal. It's a finale that suits ''Modern Family'' as it is in 2020; a show that's settled into old age. This is a finale that's both tidy and unfinished, and that feels just right'. The episode was praised by critics and fans alike, particularly for the humour in Claire and Mitchell's ice skating scene, Mitchell and Cam's karaoke scene and The Dunphy children's final joke on Luke, with TV Fanatic saying, 'one of the highlights of the episode were the scenes between Haley, Alex and Luke'. The episode's message of 'leaving a porch light on' was also praised, with fans and critics expressing the highly emotional nature of this ending note.\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Modern Family}}\n[[File:Sof\u00eda Vergara at the 69th Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|thumb|Sof\u00eda Vergara with the award for ''Modern Family'' at the 69th Annual Peabody Awards]]\n''Modern Family'' has won 22 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 6 [[Writers Guild of America Award]]s.

The article \"[[Usage share of operating systems]]\" provides a broader, and more general, comparison of operating systems that includes [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[supercomputers]].\n\nBecause of the large number and variety of available [[Linux distribution]]s, they are all grouped under a single entry; see [[comparison of Linux distributions]] for a detailed comparison. There is also a variety of BSD and DOS operating systems, covered in [[comparison of BSD operating systems]] and [[comparison of DOS operating systems]]. For information on views of each operating system, see [[operating system advocacy]].\n<!-- NOTES TO EDITORS, PLEASE READ THIS\n - All tables in this article are meant to be sorted alphabetically\n - All tables should list the same operating systems. If you add an OS, please add it to ALL tables.\n - The unfixed bug count in the security table WAS updated automatically by User:SecuniBot. There WAS no\n   need to update that column manually, except to add the link to the secunia.com page corresponding to\n   an OS the first time. See below. The security table currently needs to be updated manually until this bot can be repaired/updated.\n - Please have a look at the conventions used in existing table entries when adding new data. E.g.\n   the \"Target system type\" column should list systems types like \"Server\", \"Workstation\", \"Personal computer\",\n   \"Network Appliance\", \"Embedded system\".\n - It's not necessary to list all architectures in the \"supported architectures\" columns. Just list the primary\n   ones (maybe up to five) and add \"some others\" or \"N others\" or something like that if there are more.\n   Specifically, its not necessary to add an arch to this list just because an experimental port exists.\n   Listed archs should be fully supported.\n - The same goes for filesystems, just list the important ones.\n - Use \"?\" or the {inc} template for missing data, not \"-\". \"-\" is used to mean \"none\" / \"n/a\" in these tables.\n - Some systems that have been removed from this comparison by consensus on the talk page. Please refer\n   to the discussion there before re-adding them: AmigaOS, BeOS, Reactos\n - Footnotes shall be grouped references for their respective tables.

It works as a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] language interpreter, and install procedures could be listed as simple text. AmigaOS can also benefit of a 3rd party copyrighted library called [[XAD (software)|XAD]] that is available for all POSIX ([[Unix]], [[Linux]], BSD, and for [[AmigaOS]], [[MorphOS]], etc.). This library is freely distributable and publicly available on [[Aminet]] Amiga centralized repository of all Open Source or Free programs and utilities. XAD.Library, complete with GUI Voodoo-X, is based on modules and capable to manage over 300 compression methods and package systems (Voodoo-X GUI supports 80 package systems), including those widely accepted as standards such as [[ZIP (file format)|.ZIP]], [[Cabinet (file format)|.CAB]], [[LHA (file format)|.LHA]], [[LZX|.LZX]], [[RPM Package Manager|.RPM]], etc.</ref>\n<ref name=\"AmigaOSinstallation\">A standard AmigaOS installation requires usually only few files (typically 3 to 10 files) to be copied in their appropriate directory, and libraries and language files for national localization to be put in their standard OS directories. Any Amiga user with some minimal experience knows where these files should be copied and could perform programs installations by hand.</ref>\n<ref name=\"AmiUpdate\">AmiUpdate is capable to update AmigaOS files and also all Amiga programs which are registered to use the same update program that is standard for Amiga. Updating AmigaOS requires only few libraries to be put in standard OS location (for example all libraries are stored in \"Libs:\" standard virtual device and absolute path finder for \"Libs\" directory, Fonts are all in \"Fonts:\" absolute locator, the files for language localization are all stored in \"Locale:\" and so on). This leaves Amiga users with a minimal knowledge of the system almost free to perform by hand the update of the system files.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Wine\">using [[Wine (software)|Wine]]</ref>\n<ref name=\"brandz\">{{cite web |url=http://opensolaris.org/os/community/brandz/ |title=BrandZ (Community Group brandz.WebHome) - XWiki |publisher=Opensolaris.org |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2011-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929041214/http://opensolaris.org/os/community/brandz/ |archive-date=2009-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Security ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Resource<br>access<br>control\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Subsystem<br>isolation<br>mechanisms\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Integrated<br>[[firewall (computing)|firewall]]\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Encrypted<br>file<br>systems\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[NX bit|No execute (NX)<br>page flag]]\n! colspan=\"6\" | Manufacturer acknowledged unpatched vulnerabilities (by severity)<ref name=\"unpatched\" group=\"s\"/>\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Secunia !!

The article \"[[Usage share of operating systems]]\" provides a broader, and more general, comparison of operating systems that includes [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[supercomputers]].\n\nBecause of the large number and variety of available [[Linux distribution]]s, they are all grouped under a single entry; see [[comparison of Linux distributions]] for a detailed comparison. There is also a variety of BSD and DOS operating systems, covered in [[comparison of BSD operating systems]] and [[comparison of DOS operating systems]]. For information on views of each operating system, see [[operating system advocacy]].\n<!-- NOTES TO EDITORS, PLEASE READ THIS\n - All tables in this article are meant to be sorted alphabetically\n - All tables should list the same operating systems. If you add an OS, please add it to ALL tables.\n - The unfixed bug count in the security table WAS updated automatically by User:SecuniBot. There WAS no\n   need to update that column manually, except to add the link to the secunia.com page corresponding to\n   an OS the first time. See below. The security table currently needs to be updated manually until this bot can be repaired/updated.\n - Please have a look at the conventions used in existing table entries when adding new data. E.g.\n   the \"Target system type\" column should list systems types like \"Server\", \"Workstation\", \"Personal computer\",\n   \"Network Appliance\", \"Embedded system\".\n - It's not necessary to list all architectures in the \"supported architectures\" columns. Just list the primary\n   ones (maybe up to five) and add \"some others\" or \"N others\" or something like that if there are more.\n   Specifically, its not necessary to add an arch to this list just because an experimental port exists.\n   Listed archs should be fully supported.\n - The same goes for filesystems, just list the important ones.\n - Use \"?\" or the {inc} template for missing data, not \"-\". \"-\" is used to mean \"none\" / \"n/a\" in these tables.\n - Some systems that have been removed from this comparison by consensus on the talk page. Please refer\n   to the discussion there before re-adding them: AmigaOS, BeOS, Reactos\n - Footnotes shall be grouped references for their respective tables.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Devilina Productions, with [[Scott Buck]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, alongside [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Sacha Dhawan]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[David Wenham]]. Development for the series began in late 2013, with Buck hired as the series' showrunner in December 2015 and Jones cast as Rand in February 2016. Filming took place in New York City from April to October 2016, with a focus placed on exploring the \"[[American upper class|One Percent of the One Percent]]\" through story, location, and costume design. The character's martial arts background is also explored, and each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences. As the last of several Marvel Netflix seasons to release before the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', it features set-up for that event and references to those prior seasons.\n\nThe season premiered on March 15, 2017, in New York City, with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on March 17. It received generally negative reviews from critics, particularly for its pace and storytelling, and Jones's performance. The appropriateness of his casting and storyline in terms of race was also widely discussed, while the season's fight sequences were criticized as an important element that were poorly acted, choreographed, and edited. Conversely, Henwick's performance and the use of established characters [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] and [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] did receive some praise. Third-party data analytics determined the series had strong initial viewership, but this dropped within a week. The series was renewed for a [[Iron Fist (season 2)|second season]] in July 2017.<ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\n== Episodes ==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A543F |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"NYCC2016IGNLoebBuck\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2016/10/09/iron-fist-will-bring-a-lighter-tone-to-the-marvel-netflix-series-nycc-2016|title=Iron Fist Will Bring a Lighter Tone to the Marvel / Netflix Series \u2013 NYCC 2016|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 8, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ShaolinKungFuEpTitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|title=Iron Fist Episode Titles Inspired By Shaolin Kung Fu Moves|last=Golder|first=Dave|publisher=Mym Buzz|date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=July 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928042127/http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|archivedate=September 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>}} |director=15 |writer=36 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-iron-fist/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's iron fist on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Snow Gives Way\n |DirectedBy = [[John Dahl]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Scott Buck]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|3|17}}\n |ShortSummary = After being presumed dead for 15 years, when his family were the victims of a plane crash in the Himalayas, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]] returns to New York City and goes to Rand Enterprises to meet with [[Harold Meachum]], the partner of Danny's now dead father Wendell. Danny is turned away by security, but uses martial arts to fight his way to Harold's children [[Ward Meachum|Ward]] and [[Joy Meachum|Joy]]. The Meachums reveal that Harold has been dead for years, and do not believe that Danny is who he says he is. Danny is also turned down by [[Colleen Wing]], who he wishes to work for at her newly opened dojo. The Meachums believe that \"Danny's\" appearance is a ploy by their rivals to create a leadership struggle ahead of their planned expansion to China, and Ward hires mercenaries to attack Danny. Wing witnesses him overpower them. Ward meets with Harold, who had faked his death and considers the possibility that Danny survived the plane crash.

Harold secretly visits Danny and learns that Danny has become the Iron Fist and sworn enemy of [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. Danny is able to convince Joy of his identity, but Ward is not convinced. Danny explains to Edmonds that following the plane crash, he was saved by two monks and taken to [[K'un-Lun]], another dimension that is connected to the [[Earth]] periodically. It was there that he trained in martial arts and gained the power of the Iron Fist. Edmonds is not convinced, and diagnoses Danny as suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Harold asks Ward to move Danny to a safe place where he can be useful, but Ward instead orders his men, disguised as patients at the hospital, to kill Danny.

He also visits Joy again and she offers him money to change his identity and leave. Danny refuses, and meets with his family's lawyer [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] who promises to reclaim his identity in exchange for a permanent contract between her firm and Rand Enterprises. After attacking an impolite student at Wing's dojo, Danny is forced to stay elsewhere and is gifted the use of an apartment by Hogarth. The lawyer uses fingerprint evidence to prove Danny's identity to Joy and Ward, and promises to present it in court if they stop Danny from retaking his family's company. Deducing that Harold is alive, Danny follows Ward and climbs up the side of the penthouse but is pushed off it.

Harold asks Danny to destroy the Hand in order to free him, and orders Ward to accept Danny's return to the company where his return is announced in a press conference. In a board meeting, Danny uses his position as the majority shareholder to enforce his decision to cheaply sell a newly developed drug in order to save more lives. At his apartment, Joy is attacked and wounded by [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] operatives, whom Danny overpowers. He takes her to Wing's dojo before confronting the Triad leader, Yang Hai-Qing, who holds a grudge against Joy for taking the pier. However, he stands down when Danny reveals the involvement of the Hand. As a reward for securing the pier, the Hand allows Harold to remotely observe Joy.

In a board meeting that Danny is absent from, Ward convinces the shareholders to stand against the accusations instead of accepting responsibility. However, the anxiety of always being watched by Harold causes Ward to try the new heroin. Danny convinces Wing to help him infiltrate the pier, where they find containers apparently loaded with normal supplies. Inside one he discovers Radovan, the chemist who was forced to create the heroin as the Hand held his daughter hostage. Danny fights off a guard to free Radovan, but the latter is stabbed by the guard.

Danny faces Andrei and Grigori Veznikov, the [[Bride of Nine Spiders]], and [[Scythe (comics)|Scythe]], besting them all in turn with the spiritual help of his K'un-Lun mentor [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]]; however, Danny refuses to kill Scythe as Lei Kung orders. Gao frees Sabina, reveals that she has been to K'un-Lun and knew Wendell, and easily overpowers Danny [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]].

Danny engages with the drunken [[Zhou Cheng]], who has been training to fight the student of Lei Kung. Danny almost beats Cheng to death, until the intervention of Temple and Wing. Gao and her men engage the trio, and Danny is able to use the power of the Iron Fist to best them and capture Gao.

He teaches Danny how to use the power of the Iron Fist to heal Wing, before taking Wing, Danny, and Gao away. Meanwhile, Harold reawakens from death and over several hours regains relatively normal mental functions. He finds Ward at the penthouse and feigns absolution. Ward learns from Yang that those revived by the Hand become more psychotic after each revival and attack those closest to them first.

Danny learns that Bakuto's Hand is conducting mass surveillance, and attempts to escape from the academy. He is aided in this by his childhood friend [[Steel Serpent|Davos]]. Bakuto stabs Danny with an unknown object before he and Davos fight their way to the academy gates. Danny is now unable to summon the power of the Iron Fist to open the gate, but Wing is able to open it and offers a distraction to allow the duo to escape.

Danny goes to the penthouse, where Joy has discovered that Bakuto has been transferring Rand Enterprises's money to his own accounts. Harold decides to kill Bakuto and formulates a plan to flush him and his operatives out of the compound by having Joy freeze their accounts.

What is the Iron Fist?\u2019 and then, 'How do these things get together?'\"<ref name=\"NYCC2016Collider\" /> Loeb described the structure of the season as building \"through a series of sort of metaphorical fights, which is very important in a martial arts film, to sort of show how the character needs to grow from the innocent, wide-eyed person to someone who has to come to terms with \u2018this is the way the outside world works\u2014how am I going to make it work for me?\u2019\".<ref name=\"HogarthInvolved\" />\n\nContinuing on the idea from the previous Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a \"fifth Defender\", Loeb said the season would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining \"[[American upper class|the One Percent of the One Percent]] and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, [[Pharmaceutical industry|Big Pharma]], things like that\".<ref name=\"LoebBuckCBR\" /> Actor [[Finn Jones]] added the season examined \"corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... how much do corporations have impact on society? And what we actually look at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, and what that means to society\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\" /> In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, \"There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where he is going to be, so he's not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. [A]t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can't necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized. It does become an issue for the character.\"<ref name=\"CostumeMar2017\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe main cast for the season includes Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist,<ref name=\"FinnJones\" /><ref name=\"FinnJonesConfirmed\" /> [[Jessica Henwick]] as [[Colleen Wing]],<ref name=\"Henwick\" /> [[Tom Pelphrey]] as [[Ward Meachum]],<ref name=\"StroupPelphrey\" /> [[Jessica Stroup]] as [[Joy Meachum]],<ref name=\"StroupPelphrey\" /> [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]] as [[Bakuto (comics)|Bakuto]],<ref name=\"Bakuto\" /> [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[Steel Serpent|Davos]],<ref name=\"Dhawan\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> and [[David Wenham]] as [[Harold Meachum]].<ref name=\"Wenham\" /> Dawson reprises her role from previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nRecurring throughout the season are David Furr as Wendell Rand, Danny's father;<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> Barrett Doss as Megan, a Rand Enterprises secretary;<ref name=\"Doss\" /> [[Alex Wyse]] as Kyle, Harold Meachum's personal assistant;<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> and Ramon Fernandez as Kevin Singleton, Harold Meachum's bodyguard.<ref name=\"Fernandez\" /> Wai Ching Ho recurs as Gao, reprising her role from ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'',<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> and Marquis Rodriguez recurs as Darryl, reprising his role from ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"IGNReview102\" /> [[Clifton Davis]],<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> John Sanders,<ref name=\"Sanders\" /> and Elise Santora<ref name=\"Santora\" /> portray Lawrence Wilkins, Donald Hooper, and Maria Rodriguez, respectively, members of the Rand Enterprise board. Also returning from previous Marvel Netflix series are [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /> [[Tijuana Ricks]] as Thembi Wallace,<ref name=\"Ricks\" /> and Suzanne H. Smart as Shirley Benson.<ref name=\"Smart\" />\n\n=== Design ===\nStephanie Maslansky is the costume designer for ''Iron Fist'', after serving the same role for the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky noted one of the differences with the season compared to the other Marvel Netflix series, was the neighborhoods it spent time in (\"the wealthier neighborhoods; [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Upper East Side]], that sort of thing\") compared to [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' and [[Harlem]] for ''Luke Cage''. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg1\" /> Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, \"When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be sure exactly what he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture [and almost feel] otherworldly.\" Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an \"Urban Cali\" style, which is \"a little looser, little more relaxed. But it's still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers.\" This relaxed style for Rand also provided \"a strong contrast\" to Ward Meachum who is a \"far more corporate looking person.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" /> The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on \"real [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg3\" /> Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated \"Her particular look is influenced by ancient China,\" particularly the [[Terracotta Army]] and further progresses the \"villainy\" look of the Marvel Netflix series of \"surround[ing] themselves with [money], with beautiful things.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Bayonne Bridge from Nicholas Av overpass jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Bayonne Bridge]] doubled as Anzhou, China during production]]\nMarvel announced in February 2014 that the series would be filmed in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> with Quesada stating in April that the show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Photography began in April 2016 in New York City,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> with the [[working title]] ''Kick''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"JonesEWJan2017\" /> Manuel Billeter served as director of photography after doing the same for the first seasons of ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nFilming locations included [[Mariners Harbor, Staten Island|Mariners Harbor]] and [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] on [[Staten Island]],<ref name=\"SIFilming\" /><ref name=\"SIFilming2\" /> which served as Bakuto's compound; [[28 Liberty Street]] for the exterior of Rand Enterprises, while some interiors were filmed in the [[MetLife Building]]; [[19 Gramercy Park South]] for Joy Meachum's home; [[City Hall Park]]; [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], including [[Mott Street]]; the lobby of the [[General Electric Building]] for Harold Meachum's penthouse; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; [[Green-Wood Cemetery]]; [[Bank of America Tower (Manhattan)|Bank of America Tower]]; [[Bryant Park]]; the Presidential Suite in the [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel]], serving as Rand's temporary apartment; the STK Midtown restaurant; [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Pelham Bay Park]]; the [[Bayonne Bridge]], which doubled as Anzhou, China; and [[York Avenue / Sutton Place|Sutton Place]] Park.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Filming [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 8, 2016.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\n''Iron Fist'' was filmed in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR), which Billeter stated added \"a learning curve\" to his work, forcing him to rethink how he would shoot certain scenes, such as a car lights or street lights, which become much brighter in HDR than previously. To compensate, lights would be painted on set to help \"bring down the highlights\". Post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]] worked on the season to adjust colors the filming team did not have the chance to tweak on set.<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n==== Fight training and choreography ====\nBrett Chan was the stunt-coordinator, fight choreographer, and second unit director for the season, having \"full involvement in all the episodes\". Buck wanted the fighting in the series to be mostly [[Wing Chun]] but with the [[Five Animals|animal styles]] of kung fu as well, and Chan worked alongside Buck and other Marvel executives during development of the fights. As a second unit director, the amount of creative input that Chan had depended on the episodic director he was working with. Chan was influenced by the works of the [[Shaw Brothers]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Stephen Chow]], [[Bruce Lee]], and [[Yuen Woo Ping]], but avoided being \"floaty or wire-like\" per a request from Marvel; wire work and CGI were used minimally for fights.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" />\n\nChan worked closely with Jones during early preparation for the season, but during filming spent most of his time either choreographing sequences or working on-set.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" /> Chan noted that Jones had a very busy schedule, and it was difficult to find the time to train him in martial arts which Chan felt was \"a lifestyle\" and \"isn't something you can just pick up, or train for every once in a while. It's something you need to be really involved in\". He did note that Henwick trained for six hours every day regardless if she was scheduled to train that day or if she was filming.<ref name=\"ChanScroll\" /> Jones elaborated that he had three weeks before filming began to train for the season,<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> during which time he would spend two and a half hours a day training in martial arts before doing weight training in the afternoons.<ref name=\"JonesTrainingEW\" /> Once filming began, Jones had a day and a half during weekends in which he could continue his training, and otherwise would have to learn fight choreography 15 minutes before filming an action sequence. He described this process as \"a baptism of fire and I just learned on the job\".<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nThe executive producers wanted the score to feel modern, and composer [[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]] agreed not to use an orchestra. He did try some instruments to represent the Asian influence on the series, but these were deemed \"too traditional\" by the producers. Only some \"heavily affected\" Japanese flutes were ultimately used.<ref name=\"MorrisAD\" /> Morris also looked to avoid using themes for different characters in a traditional way. He did write a theme for Rand, which is heard in the series' title sequence, as well as a theme for [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], but in general focused on environmental music.<ref name=\"MorrisMR\" /> Additional music heard in the season includes \"[[So Fresh, So Clean]]\" by [[Outkast]], \"[[Uptown Saturday Night (album)|Krystal Karrington]]\" by [[Camp Lo]], \"[[Priesthood (album)|Heat of the Moment]]\" by [[Killah Priest]], \"[[Black Mags]]\" by [[The Cool Kids]], \"[[Summertime '06|Hang N' Bang]]\" by [[Vince Staples]], \"[[Run the Jewels 2|Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1]]\" by [[Run the Jewels]],<ref name=\"AdditionalMusic\" /> and music from [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name=\"NYCC2016Footage\" />\n\nA soundtrack album featuring Morris's score was released by Marvel digitally on March 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of the season.

There does have to be a lot of cooperation between all the different [series' showrunners]. But other than that, we work distinctly by ourselves.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> The season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], [[Stark Industries]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], and Seagate Prison,<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /> and mentions the Dogs of Hell biker gang, ''New York Bulletin'' editor-in-chief Mitchell Ellison and reporter [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"ScreenRantEasterEggs\" /> [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] and Midland Circle.<ref name=\"GamesRadarEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"MTVEasterEggs\" /> The events of the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'', such as the Hand's attack on Metro General Hospital, are noted throughout the season,<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /> and the Hand's blood draining facility from that season is also seen.<ref name=\"MTVEasterEggs\" />\n\n== Release ==\nThe first season of ''Iron Fist'' was released on March 17, 2017, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix worldwide,<ref name=\"Release\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and HDR.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /><ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\nIn October 2016, Buck and the season's main cast promoted the season at [[New York Comic-Con]], debuting exclusive footage from the season and the first look at the first trailer.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> In early February 2017, the official trailer for the season was released.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> David Betancourt, reacting to the trailer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', compared the story it presents to that of ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), and questioned the fact that Iron Fist's comic costume was not shown.<ref name=\"WashPoTrailer\" /> Eric Francisco at [[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] noted that the trailer was widely criticized on [[Twitter]] for the season's depiction of Rand as an \"insufferable college hippie\".<ref name=\"InverseTrailer\" /> On March 15, 2017, the season held its premiere at the [[Tribeca Performing Arts Center]] in New York City.<ref name=\"Premiere\" /><ref name=\"PremiereLocation\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Audience viewership ===\nNetflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for their series, but Parrot Analytics determined that the season generated over 63 million \"Demand Expressions\" at its peak, behind only ''Luke Cage''{{'}}s 69&nbsp;million in terms of all the Marvel Netflix series, with Parrot calculating expressions \"by evaluating streaming video, P2P-sharing, social chatter, and more.\"<ref name=\"ParrotDemand\" /> 7Park Data, which measures the number of streams on subscription video services, determined ''Iron Fist'' to be the most binge-watched premiere for Netflix in 2017 with 54.7% of ''Iron Fist'' streams on March 17, 2017 being of three episodes or more. The average score was 46.9%. 7Park Data also determined that ''Iron Fist'' accounted for 14.6% of all Netflix streams on its premiere date, the highest percentage of any series premiere measured by the company including previous Marvel Netflix premieres.<ref name=\"7ParkData\" />\n\nParrot later revealed that demand for ''Iron Fist'' a week after it launched was halved. This was the largest drop in retention for a Marvel Netflix series, indicating \"that people started binge-watching the show in its first few days and then didn't come back to finish the season the next weekend.\"<ref name=\"ParrotDemandDropOff\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the third-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 28% of the viewers that the second season of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the firm believed was the most viewed season. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100&nbsp;million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{multiple image|align=right|footer=Series' lead Finn Jones (L) was criticized for his performance, but Jessica Henwick (R) was widely praised for hers.|image1=Finn Jones by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width1=171|image2=Jessica Henwick by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=179}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 20% approval rating with an average rating of 4.24/10 based on 83 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite some promising moments, ''Iron Fist'' is weighed down by an absence of momentum and originality.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv//marvel_s_iron_fist/s01 |title=Marvel's Iron Fist: Season 1 (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-iron-fist |title=''Marvel's Iron Fist'': Season 1 |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first six episodes of the season, Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' found ''Iron Fist'' to be the \"first big misstep\" for Marvel and Netflix, lacking the \"street-level authenticity\" that their previous series had. Fienberg felt Jones was unable to elevate the material, instead coming across as \"a spoiled frat boy\". He said the season lacked basic character archetypes such as \"a worthy adversary to our hero\", comic relief, or a \"voice of wise authority\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan gave a negative review for the first two episodes, calling them \"ferociously boring\" and \"inessential\". After criticizing the pacing, action, general characterization, production design, cinematography, and dialogue, Ryan suggested that Henwick should have been the star of the season instead of Jones.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\nRob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized Jones' performance, calling him \"totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf.\" He also felt the character was missing humor and inner turmoil, and said Rand's \"mystic Zen quotes go over like a ''[[Wayne's World]]'' set-up minus the punch line.\"<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] awarded the season 3 stars out of 5 after seeing the first six episodes. She said the season had a good cast and great origin story, but had a \"glacial pace\" and choppy editing. She did find Jones charming, but agreed with Fienberg that the season was lacking a villain, and felt that Temple was \"shoe-horned\" into the season.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> In his review for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, \"''Iron Fist'' needed to be so much weirder than it actually is, akin to how ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016) essentially re-told the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. ''Iron Fist'' starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when the vast majority of the principal characters [are so] underdeveloped.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /> Fitzpatrick felt that Colleen Wing was the better of the supporting characters, and praised Henwick's performance.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" />\n\n[[Uproxx]]'s [[Alan Sepinwall]] felt of the first six episodes, \"It's easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows\", criticizing the pacing and \"miscasting\" of Jones. He was more positive about Moss and Dawson's roles. Sepinwall concluded, \"the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They\u2019re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny had to be [in ''The Defenders'', and as a result,] we got a show that's so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season\".<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> Dan Jolin also gave 3 stars out of 5 in his review for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. He felt it was beneficial that ''Iron Fist'' released after ''Doctor Strange'' introduced the MCU to \"all his Eastern-mystical baggage\", and called Iron Fist \"a fresh presence\" compared to \"moody, conflicted heroism\" of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that Buck had \"no sense of connection to his subject\" as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt it was not until the sixth episode \"that you really feel the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins\" thanks to episodic director RZA who \"finally gives the show a proper sense of flair ... It's enough to make you wish they made him the showrunner.\" Jolin concluded, \"''Iron Fist'' works some fantastical flavor into the MCU's down-to-earth Defenders nook, but it needs more proper kung-fu flair than showrunner Buck allows.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" />\n\nResponding to these reviews, Jones said that \"these shows are not made for critics, they are first and foremost made for the fans ... when the fans of the Marvel Netflix world and fans of the comic books view the show through the lens of just wanting to enjoy a superhero show, then they will really enjoy what they see.\"<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> Jones later attributed the negative reviews to the fact that his character, \"a white American billionaire\", was similar to [[Donald Trump]] who had become \"public enemy number one, especially in the US\" between the making of the season and its release.<ref name=\"JonesTrump\" /> In an article for [[Vox (website)|Vox]], Alex Abad-Santos said Jones was just attempting to \"pass the blame\" away from himself when the real problem with the season was \"no one thought about what makes the character human\". Abad-Santos suggested that the season be a warning to others telling stories about superheroes, who he thought needed to ensure they were \"using established characters to touch on other topics\u2014mental illness, parenthood, race, trauma\u2014instead of simply rehashing old plots.\"<ref name=\"VoxReply\" />\n\n==== Fight scene criticisms ====\nFeinberg, in his review, criticized the fight sequences in the season, calling them \"weakly staged and all-too-brief, without any effort to even pretend that the show's leading man is doing any of his own stunts\" and felt \"Danny's strength and his enhanced abilities are barely explained and inconsistently depicted.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Sepinwall described the fighting in the season as \"both brief and unconvincing\", criticizing Jones' ability to perform the fights as well as the way they were filmed and edited.<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> One fight sequence, featuring 56 cuts for just 35 seconds of footage, was highlighted by some fans and critics as emblematic of the season's fight problems, with ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Christopher Hooton saying the editing created this \"disorientating, messy and ultimately not particularly impactful sequence\". He compared it to what he believed to be the superior work of Jackie Chan, citing a single take fight scene featuring that performer, as well as the fight scenes from ''Daredevil'' which \"had great success with a more considered shot selection and more minimal cutting than ''Iron Fist''\".<ref name=\"56Cuts\" />\n\nAloysius Low at [[CNET]] also compared Jones's fighting in the season to that of Chan as well as Jet Li, saying, \"There's none of that elegance I expect from a kung fu master, and he gets hit way too easily for a trained expert.\" Low also criticized the fact that Jones was unable to fight with both of his fists in the season, while noting that what he believed to be the best fight of the season was when Jones was faced with the drunken fist technique and was losing because of it with Rand only winning that fight due to \"the inevitable invincibility of [his] plot armor\".<ref name=\"cnetFights\" /> Brook H. at Pop Culture Uncovered felt that many of the season's fight scene issues stemmed from a decision to model ''Iron Fist'' on the American action films of the 1980s and 1990s, rather than updating the style of 1970s Hong Kong films: the season has \"no fluidity, variety, interesting styles, or back-and-forth between combatants. These fights were an American interpretation of martial arts, using the visage of kung fu to mask nothing more than straightforward brawling.\" Brook H.'s piece noted that Chan had extensive experience working as a stunt coordinator, but limited time working as a fight choreographer before joining the series, while a professional fight choreographer discussing the season felt the choreography was not the problem as \"I can see where the choreographers were going\" but the actors, particularly Jones, were just not skilled enough to deliver on them. The quick cut editing was also criticized, again, as well as attempts to \"slow-down [[The Wachowskis|Wachowski]]-style, only to speed right back up\" which \"failed miserably\".<ref name=\"PCUFights\" />\n\n=== Casting controversy ===\n{{See also|White savior#Appearance in television}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, Russ Burlingame noted for ComicBook.com that Marvel may have been tempted to change Danny Rand from white to a person of Asian descent, especially given that the other Marvel Netflix series ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' already set a precedent of increasing diversity by exploring a female and African-America lead, respectively. However, Burlingame was against this happening, wanting to see \"the classic\" version of the character, and feeling that making the character Asian simply because he is a martial artist was itself \"quietly, subtlely racist\".<ref name=\"CastingCB\" /> This situation, of casting either a white or Asian-American actor in the role, was described as \"lose/lose\" by Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death,<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> while Albert Ching at [[Comic Book Resources]] was strictly against casting an Asian-American. He said that any extra Asian-American representation onscreen would be positive, but that he was not comfortable with the idea of the first major Asian superhero in film or television being a martial artist. Ching questioned why this discussion had not been raised with any other character, and suggested that a non-white, non-Asian actor be cast instead to avoid either issues. He highlighted the casting of [[Chloe Bennet]] and [[Ming-Na Wen]] in the MCU series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', both in \"non-stereotypical roles\", as examples of what roles he would rather have Asian-Americans be cast in.<ref name=\"CastingCBR\" />\n\nIn response to this, Keith Chow at The Nerds of Color specifically asked Marvel to cast an Asian-American in the role. Chow focused on the lack of Asian-American representation in mainstream television and films, the fact that the character's story would not have to change to accommodate this difference, and how it would stop elements of the \"white savior\" trope being depicted where a \"white-guy-is-better-at-being-Asian-than-the-Asians\".<ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> Chow did not feel it was equivalent to simply add a different Asian hero to the series such as [[Shang-Chi]] as there is a difference between the experience of an Asian character and an Asian-American, with the latter still being able to have a \"fish out of water\" storyline as Rand does in the comics. Chow disagreed that it was racist to have an Asian-American martial artist, as martial arts are a natural part of an Asian-American's heritage and would not be the only thing the character does;<ref name=\"CastingCA\" /> he gave the example of [[Daniel Wu]] in ''[[Into the Badlands (TV series)|Into the Badlands]]'', the only other Asian American lead of a mainstream martial arts series, who agreed to star in that series despite the perceived stereotypes because of the characterization beyond fighting, and because his \"culture did create kung fu, so is that a stereotype? No it's part of [my] history\". Chow started the hashtag #AAIronFist on [[Twitter]], beginning a movement that received support from \"high profile people\" such as [[Lexi Alexander]] and [[Gail Simone]].<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" />\n\nMarvel and Netflix became aware of the movement to cast an Asian-American as Danny Rand,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> particularly after Chow began writing on the subject in March 2014,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> and considered several Asian-American actors for the role.<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> This included [[Lewis Tan]], who went on to guest star as the villain [[Zhou Cheng]] in the season.<ref name=\"Tan\" /> However, by the time Buck was announced as showrunner in December 2015, the studios were \"leaning toward keeping Iron Fist white.\"<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> Jones, who is white, was cast in February 2016.<ref name=\"FinnJones\" />\n\nFollowing the casting, [[io9]]'s Rob Bricken spoke out against commentators who accepted Jones's casting because Marvel had been in a \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" situation, feeling this was not true because the benefits that could have come from casting an Asian-American actor\u2014including having the character \"{{em|reclaim}} his Asian heritage, instead of taking it from others\"\u2014outweighed just copying the stereotypes from the comics.<ref name=\"Castingio9\" /> His colleague Katharine Trendecosta later added, after watching the completed season, that an Asian-American Danny Rand would have been more interesting than the final version, especially in being able to explore how he felt about returning to America having become more of a stereotype, and feeling out of place in K'un Lun due to being American while feeling out of place among the high-society circles of America due to being Asian.<ref name=\"Castingio92\" /> In response to these criticisms, Jones agreed that \"there needs to be more diversity in film and television\" but was confused why ''Iron Fist'' in particular had been targeted by internet commentators and said that they should get angry at \"real problems in the world\" instead.<ref name=\"JonesVulture\" /> After the irony of him championing diversity through his Twitter account was raised with Jones in March 2017, he added that the producers chose to lean in to the problematic aspects of the character and surround him with \"one of the most diverse\" casts of the Marvel Netflix series to create a \"socially progressive story\" without alienating the comic fan base. Jones subsequently took down his Twitter account.<ref name=\"JonesTwitter\" />\n\nIn response to specific criticisms that Rand is a \"white savior\", Buck said that he had approached the character without knowing of the racial issues surrounding him and his comic history, and that \"I can say most definitively Danny Rand is no white saviour. He's trying to save himself, if anything.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> Jones agreed, saying, \"Danny Rand is not a white savior. Danny Rand can hardly save himself, let alone an entire race of people. He is a very complicated, vulnerable individual.\" Jones felt that changing K'un Lun to be a multi-cultural place for the series aided in lessening the white savior narrative, while stating, \"It's up to the writers to address thematic and narrative choices. And it's up to us as actors to try and breathe life into these characters as truthfully and as honestly and with [as much] genuine passion as possible.\"<ref name=\"JonesBuzzFeed\" /> [[Roy Thomas]], co-creator of the character, also defended the season following accusations of cultural appropriation, saying that the character was created for a less \"PC\" time and that K'un Lun was always meant to be a mythical place rather than a prepresentation of Asia. Thomas added that he would not be bothered if the character had been changed to Asian-American, but was not \"ashamed\" that Rand remained white.<ref name=\"RoyThomas\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe season was nominated for Best New Media Superhero Series at the [[44th Saturn Awards]],<ref name=\"SaturnsNom\" /> but lost to Marvel's own ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]''.<ref

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Devilina Productions, with [[Scott Buck]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, alongside [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Sacha Dhawan]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[David Wenham]]. Development for the series began in late 2013, with Buck hired as the series' showrunner in December 2015 and Jones cast as Rand in February 2016. Filming took place in New York City from April to October 2016, with a focus placed on exploring the \"[[American upper class|One Percent of the One Percent]]\" through story, location, and costume design. The character's martial arts background is also explored, and each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences. As the last of several Marvel Netflix seasons to release before the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', it features set-up for that event and references to those prior seasons.\n\nThe season premiered on March 15, 2017, in New York City, with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on March 17. It received generally negative reviews from critics, particularly for its pace and storytelling, and Jones's performance. The appropriateness of his casting and storyline in terms of race was also widely discussed, while the season's fight sequences were criticized as an important element that were poorly acted, choreographed, and edited. Conversely, Henwick's performance and the use of established characters [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]] and [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] did receive some praise. Third-party data analytics determined the series had strong initial viewership, but this dropped within a week. The series was renewed for a [[Iron Fist (season 2)|second season]] in July 2017.<ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\n== Episodes ==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A543F |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"NYCC2016IGNLoebBuck\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2016/10/09/iron-fist-will-bring-a-lighter-tone-to-the-marvel-netflix-series-nycc-2016|title=Iron Fist Will Bring a Lighter Tone to the Marvel / Netflix Series \u2013 NYCC 2016|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 8, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ShaolinKungFuEpTitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|title=Iron Fist Episode Titles Inspired By Shaolin Kung Fu Moves|last=Golder|first=Dave|publisher=Mym Buzz|date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=July 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928042127/http://www.mymbuzz.com/2017/01/23/iron-fist-episode-titles-inspired-by-shaolin-kung-fu-moves/|archivedate=September 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>}} |director=15 |writer=36 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-iron-fist/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's iron fist on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Snow Gives Way\n |DirectedBy = [[John Dahl]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Scott Buck]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|3|17}}\n |ShortSummary = After being presumed dead for 15 years, when his family were the victims of a plane crash in the Himalayas, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]] returns to New York City and goes to Rand Enterprises to meet with [[Harold Meachum]], the partner of Danny's now dead father Wendell. Danny is turned away by security, but uses martial arts to fight his way to Harold's children [[Ward Meachum|Ward]] and [[Joy Meachum|Joy]]. The Meachums reveal that Harold has been dead for years, and do not believe that Danny is who he says he is. Danny is also turned down by [[Colleen Wing]], who he wishes to work for at her newly opened dojo. The Meachums believe that \"Danny's\" appearance is a ploy by their rivals to create a leadership struggle ahead of their planned expansion to China, and Ward hires mercenaries to attack Danny. Wing witnesses him overpower them. Ward meets with Harold, who had faked his death and considers the possibility that Danny survived the plane crash.

Harold secretly visits Danny and learns that Danny has become the Iron Fist and sworn enemy of [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. Danny is able to convince Joy of his identity, but Ward is not convinced. Danny explains to Edmonds that following the plane crash, he was saved by two monks and taken to [[K'un-Lun]], another dimension that is connected to the [[Earth]] periodically. It was there that he trained in martial arts and gained the power of the Iron Fist. Edmonds is not convinced, and diagnoses Danny as suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Harold asks Ward to move Danny to a safe place where he can be useful, but Ward instead orders his men, disguised as patients at the hospital, to kill Danny.

He also visits Joy again and she offers him money to change his identity and leave. Danny refuses, and meets with his family's lawyer [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]] who promises to reclaim his identity in exchange for a permanent contract between her firm and Rand Enterprises. After attacking an impolite student at Wing's dojo, Danny is forced to stay elsewhere and is gifted the use of an apartment by Hogarth. The lawyer uses fingerprint evidence to prove Danny's identity to Joy and Ward, and promises to present it in court if they stop Danny from retaking his family's company.

Harold asks Danny to destroy the Hand in order to free him, and orders Ward to accept Danny's return to the company where his return is announced in a press conference. In a board meeting, Danny uses his position as the majority shareholder to enforce his decision to cheaply sell a newly developed drug in order to save more lives. At his apartment, Joy is attacked and wounded by [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] operatives, whom Danny overpowers. He takes her to Wing's dojo before confronting the Triad leader, Yang Hai-Qing, who holds a grudge against Joy for taking the pier. However, he stands down when Danny reveals the involvement of the Hand. As a reward for securing the pier, the Hand allows Harold to remotely observe Joy.

After a chemical factory owned by Rand Enterprises is linked to cancer, Danny personally apologizes to an aggrieved citizen and is recorded by a lawyer who distributes it to the media. In a board meeting that Danny is absent from, Ward convinces the shareholders to stand against the accusations instead of accepting responsibility. However, the anxiety of always being watched by Harold causes Ward to try the new heroin. Danny convinces Wing to help him infiltrate the pier, where they find containers apparently loaded with normal supplies. Inside one he discovers Radovan, the chemist who was forced to create the heroin as the Hand held his daughter hostage. Danny fights off a guard to free Radovan, but the latter is stabbed by the guard.

Danny and Ward start searching Rand warehouses for clues as to the Hand's operation, and find the severed head of Radovan's guard as a message challenging Danny to a combat. Danny sends Ward to deal with a crisis management meeting about the video of his apology while Danny accepts the challenge: Danny will fight to free Radovan's daughter Sabina, and leave his company to the Hand's machinations if he loses. Danny faces Andrei and Grigori Veznikov, the [[Bride of Nine Spiders]], and [[Scythe (comics)|Scythe]], besting them all in turn with the spiritual help of his K'un-Lun mentor [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]]; however, Danny refuses to kill Scythe as Lei Kung orders.

Meanwhile, Harold reawakens from death and over several hours regains relatively normal mental functions. He finds Ward at the penthouse and feigns absolution. Ward learns from Yang that those revived by the Hand become more psychotic after each revival and attack those closest to them first.

Danny learns that Bakuto's Hand is conducting mass surveillance, and attempts to escape from the academy. He is aided in this by his childhood friend [[Steel Serpent|Davos]]. Bakuto stabs Danny with an unknown object before he and Davos fight their way to the academy gates. Danny is now unable to summon the power of the Iron Fist to open the gate, but Wing is able to open it and offers a distraction to allow the duo to escape.

Danny goes to the penthouse, where Joy has discovered that Bakuto has been transferring Rand Enterprises's money to his own accounts. Harold decides to kill Bakuto and formulates a plan to flush him and his operatives out of the compound by having Joy freeze their accounts. Danny agrees to help Harold kill Bakuto, but Joy is against this. The Hand captures Wing and takes her to the compound, where Danny and Davos wait for Bakuto to emerge. Joy freezes the accounts.

Buck said that much of the season was \"about a journey of finding self ... in terms of what he wants to be as far as 'Who is Danny Rand? What is the Iron Fist?\u2019 and then, 'How do these things get together?'\"<ref name=\"NYCC2016Collider\" /> Loeb described the structure of the season as building \"through a series of sort of metaphorical fights, which is very important in a martial arts film, to sort of show how the character needs to grow from the innocent, wide-eyed person to someone who has to come to terms with \u2018this is the way the outside world works\u2014how am I going to make it work for me?\u2019\".<ref name=\"HogarthInvolved\" />\n\nContinuing on the idea from the previous Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a \"fifth Defender\", Loeb said the season would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining \"[[American upper class|the One Percent of the One Percent]] and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, [[Pharmaceutical industry|Big Pharma]], things like that\".<ref name=\"LoebBuckCBR\" /> Actor [[Finn Jones]] added the season examined \"corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... how much do corporations have impact on society? And what we actually look at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, and what that means to society\".<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\" /> In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, \"There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where he is going to be, so he's not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. [A]t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can't necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized. It does become an issue for the character.\"<ref name=\"CostumeMar2017\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe main cast for the season includes Jones as Danny Rand / Iron Fist,<ref name=\"FinnJones\" /><ref name=\"FinnJonesConfirmed\" /> [[Jessica Henwick]] as [[Colleen Wing]],<ref name=\"Henwick\" /> [[Tom Pelphrey]] as [[Ward Meachum]],<ref name=\"StroupPelphrey\" /> [[Jessica Stroup]] as [[Joy Meachum]],<ref name=\"StroupPelphrey\" /> [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]] as [[Bakuto (comics)|Bakuto]],<ref name=\"Bakuto\" /> [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[Steel Serpent|Davos]],<ref name=\"Dhawan\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> and [[David Wenham]] as [[Harold Meachum]].<ref name=\"Wenham\" /> Dawson reprises her role from previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\nRecurring throughout the season are David Furr as Wendell Rand, Danny's father;<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> Barrett Doss as Megan, a Rand Enterprises secretary;<ref name=\"Doss\" /> [[Alex Wyse]] as Kyle, Harold Meachum's personal assistant;<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> and Ramon Fernandez as Kevin Singleton, Harold Meachum's bodyguard.<ref name=\"Fernandez\" /> Wai Ching Ho recurs as Gao, reprising her role from ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'',<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> and Marquis Rodriguez recurs as Darryl, reprising his role from ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"IGNReview102\" /> [[Clifton Davis]],<ref name=\"31Characters\" /> John Sanders,<ref name=\"Sanders\" /> and Elise Santora<ref name=\"Santora\" /> portray Lawrence Wilkins, Donald Hooper, and Maria Rodriguez, respectively, members of the Rand Enterprise board. Also returning from previous Marvel Netflix series are [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /> [[Tijuana Ricks]] as Thembi Wallace,<ref name=\"Ricks\" /> and Suzanne H. Smart as Shirley Benson.<ref name=\"Smart\" />\n\n=== Design ===\nStephanie Maslansky is the costume designer for ''Iron Fist'', after serving the same role for the previous Marvel Netflix series.<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> Maslansky noted one of the differences with the season compared to the other Marvel Netflix series, was the neighborhoods it spent time in (\"the wealthier neighborhoods; [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Upper East Side]], that sort of thing\") compared to [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] for ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' and [[Harlem]] for ''Luke Cage''. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility.<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg1\" /> Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, \"When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be sure exactly what he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture [and almost feel] otherworldly.\" Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an \"Urban Cali\" style, which is \"a little looser, little more relaxed. But it's still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers.\" This relaxed style for Rand also provided \"a strong contrast\" to Ward Meachum who is a \"far more corporate looking person.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" /> The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on \"real [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg3\" /> Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated \"Her particular look is influenced by ancient China,\" particularly the [[Terracotta Army]] and further progresses the \"villainy\" look of the Marvel Netflix series of \"surround[ing] themselves with [money], with beautiful things.\"<ref name=\"MaslanskyForbesPg2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Bayonne Bridge from Nicholas Av overpass jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Bayonne Bridge]] doubled as Anzhou, China during production]]\nMarvel announced in February 2014 that the series would be filmed in New York City,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> with Quesada stating in April that the show would be filming on location in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Photography began in April 2016 in New York City,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> with the [[working title]] ''Kick''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /><ref name=\"JonesEWJan2017\" /> Manuel Billeter served as director of photography after doing the same for the first seasons of ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage''.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nFilming locations included [[Mariners Harbor, Staten Island|Mariners Harbor]] and [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] on [[Staten Island]],<ref name=\"SIFilming\" /><ref name=\"SIFilming2\" /> which served as Bakuto's compound; [[28 Liberty Street]] for the exterior of Rand Enterprises, while some interiors were filmed in the [[MetLife Building]]; [[19 Gramercy Park South]] for Joy Meachum's home; [[City Hall Park]]; [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], including [[Mott Street]]; the lobby of the [[General Electric Building]] for Harold Meachum's penthouse; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; [[Green-Wood Cemetery]]; [[Bank of America Tower (Manhattan)|Bank of America Tower]]; [[Bryant Park]]; the Presidential Suite in the [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel]], serving as Rand's temporary apartment; the STK Midtown restaurant; [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Pelham Bay Park]]; the [[Bayonne Bridge]], which doubled as Anzhou, China; and [[York Avenue / Sutton Place|Sutton Place]] Park.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Filming [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 8, 2016.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" />\n\n''Iron Fist'' was filmed in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] (HDR), which Billeter stated added \"a learning curve\" to his work, forcing him to rethink how he would shoot certain scenes, such as a car lights or street lights, which become much brighter in HDR than previously. To compensate, lights would be painted on set to help \"bring down the highlights\". Post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]] worked on the season to adjust colors the filming team did not have the chance to tweak on set.<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n==== Fight training and choreography ====\nBrett Chan was the stunt-coordinator, fight choreographer, and second unit director for the season, having \"full involvement in all the episodes\". Buck wanted the fighting in the series to be mostly [[Wing Chun]] but with the [[Five Animals|animal styles]] of kung fu as well, and Chan worked alongside Buck and other Marvel executives during development of the fights. As a second unit director, the amount of creative input that Chan had depended on the episodic director he was working with. Chan was influenced by the works of the [[Shaw Brothers]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Stephen Chow]], [[Bruce Lee]], and [[Yuen Woo Ping]], but avoided being \"floaty or wire-like\" per a request from Marvel; wire work and CGI were used minimally for fights.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" />\n\nChan worked closely with Jones during early preparation for the season, but during filming spent most of his time either choreographing sequences or working on-set.<ref name=\"ChanCV\" /> Chan noted that Jones had a very busy schedule, and it was difficult to find the time to train him in martial arts which Chan felt was \"a lifestyle\" and \"isn't something you can just pick up, or train for every once in a while. It's something you need to be really involved in\". He did note that Henwick trained for six hours every day regardless if she was scheduled to train that day or if she was filming.<ref name=\"ChanScroll\" /> Jones elaborated that he had three weeks before filming began to train for the season,<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> during which time he would spend two and a half hours a day training in martial arts before doing weight training in the afternoons.<ref name=\"JonesTrainingEW\" /> Once filming began, Jones had a day and a half during weekends in which he could continue his training, and otherwise would have to learn fight choreography 15 minutes before filming an action sequence. He described this process as \"a baptism of fire and I just learned on the job\".<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nThe executive producers wanted the score to feel modern, and composer [[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]] agreed not to use an orchestra. He did try some instruments to represent the Asian influence on the series, but these were deemed \"too traditional\" by the producers. Only some \"heavily affected\" Japanese flutes were ultimately used.<ref name=\"MorrisAD\" /> Morris also looked to avoid using themes for different characters in a traditional way. He did write a theme for Rand, which is heard in the series' title sequence, as well as a theme for [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], but in general focused on environmental music.<ref name=\"MorrisMR\" /> Additional music heard in the season includes \"[[So Fresh, So Clean]]\" by [[Outkast]], \"[[Uptown Saturday Night (album)|Krystal Karrington]]\" by [[Camp Lo]], \"[[Priesthood (album)|Heat of the Moment]]\" by [[Killah Priest]], \"[[Black Mags]]\" by [[The Cool Kids]], \"[[Summertime '06|Hang N' Bang]]\" by [[Vince Staples]], \"[[Run the Jewels 2|Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1]]\" by [[Run the Jewels]],<ref name=\"AdditionalMusic\" /> and music from [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name=\"NYCC2016Footage\" />\n\nA soundtrack album featuring Morris's score was released by Marvel digitally on March 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of the season.

There does have to be a lot of cooperation between all the different [series' showrunners]. But other than that, we work distinctly by ourselves.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> The season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], [[Stark Industries]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], and Seagate Prison,<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /> and mentions the Dogs of Hell biker gang, ''New York Bulletin'' editor-in-chief Mitchell Ellison and reporter [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"ScreenRantEasterEggs\" /> [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] and Midland Circle.<ref name=\"GamesRadarEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"MTVEasterEggs\" /> The events of the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'', such as the Hand's attack on Metro General Hospital, are noted throughout the season,<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /> and the Hand's blood draining facility from that season is also seen.<ref name=\"MTVEasterEggs\" />\n\n== Release ==\nThe first season of ''Iron Fist'' was released on March 17, 2017, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix worldwide,<ref name=\"Release\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and HDR.<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /><ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\nIn October 2016, Buck and the season's main cast promoted the season at [[New York Comic-Con]], debuting exclusive footage from the season and the first look at the first trailer.<ref name=\"NYCC2016\" /> In early February 2017, the official trailer for the season was released.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> David Betancourt, reacting to the trailer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', compared the story it presents to that of ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), and questioned the fact that Iron Fist's comic costume was not shown.<ref name=\"WashPoTrailer\" /> Eric Francisco at [[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] noted that the trailer was widely criticized on [[Twitter]] for the season's depiction of Rand as an \"insufferable college hippie\".<ref name=\"InverseTrailer\" /> On March 15, 2017, the season held its premiere at the [[Tribeca Performing Arts Center]] in New York City.<ref name=\"Premiere\" /><ref name=\"PremiereLocation\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Audience viewership ===\nNetflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for their series, but Parrot Analytics determined that the season generated over 63 million \"Demand Expressions\" at its peak, behind only ''Luke Cage''{{'}}s 69&nbsp;million in terms of all the Marvel Netflix series, with Parrot calculating expressions \"by evaluating streaming video, P2P-sharing, social chatter, and more.\"<ref name=\"ParrotDemand\" /> 7Park Data, which measures the number of streams on subscription video services, determined ''Iron Fist'' to be the most binge-watched premiere for Netflix in 2017 with 54.7% of ''Iron Fist'' streams on March 17, 2017 being of three episodes or more. The average score was 46.9%. 7Park Data also determined that ''Iron Fist'' accounted for 14.6% of all Netflix streams on its premiere date, the highest percentage of any series premiere measured by the company including previous Marvel Netflix premieres.<ref name=\"7ParkData\" />\n\nParrot later revealed that demand for ''Iron Fist'' a week after it launched was halved. This was the largest drop in retention for a Marvel Netflix series, indicating \"that people started binge-watching the show in its first few days and then didn't come back to finish the season the next weekend.\"<ref name=\"ParrotDemandDropOff\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the third-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 28% of the viewers that the second season of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the firm believed was the most viewed season. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100&nbsp;million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{multiple image|align=right|footer=Series' lead Finn Jones (L) was criticized for his performance, but Jessica Henwick (R) was widely praised for hers.|image1=Finn Jones by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width1=171|image2=Jessica Henwick by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=179}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 20% approval rating with an average rating of 4.24/10 based on 83 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite some promising moments, ''Iron Fist'' is weighed down by an absence of momentum and originality.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv//marvel_s_iron_fist/s01 |title=Marvel's Iron Fist: Season 1 (2017)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=December 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 37 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-iron-fist |title=''Marvel's Iron Fist'': Season 1 |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first six episodes of the season, Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' found ''Iron Fist'' to be the \"first big misstep\" for Marvel and Netflix, lacking the \"street-level authenticity\" that their previous series had. Fienberg felt Jones was unable to elevate the material, instead coming across as \"a spoiled frat boy\". He said the season lacked basic character archetypes such as \"a worthy adversary to our hero\", comic relief, or a \"voice of wise authority\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan gave a negative review for the first two episodes, calling them \"ferociously boring\" and \"inessential\". After criticizing the pacing, action, general characterization, production design, cinematography, and dialogue, Ryan suggested that Henwick should have been the star of the season instead of Jones.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\nRob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized Jones' performance, calling him \"totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf.\" He also felt the character was missing humor and inner turmoil, and said Rand's \"mystic Zen quotes go over like a ''[[Wayne's World]]'' set-up minus the punch line.\"<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> Allison Keene of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] awarded the season 3 stars out of 5 after seeing the first six episodes. She said the season had a good cast and great origin story, but had a \"glacial pace\" and choppy editing. She did find Jones charming, but agreed with Fienberg that the season was lacking a villain, and felt that Temple was \"shoe-horned\" into the season.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> In his review for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, \"''Iron Fist'' needed to be so much weirder than it actually is, akin to how ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016) essentially re-told the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. ''Iron Fist'' starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when the vast majority of the principal characters [are so] underdeveloped.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /> Fitzpatrick felt that Colleen Wing was the better of the supporting characters, and praised Henwick's performance.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" />\n\n[[Uproxx]]'s [[Alan Sepinwall]] felt of the first six episodes, \"It's easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows\", criticizing the pacing and \"miscasting\" of Jones. He was more positive about Moss and Dawson's roles. Sepinwall concluded, \"the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They\u2019re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny had to be [in ''The Defenders'', and as a result,] we got a show that's so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season\".<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> Dan Jolin also gave 3 stars out of 5 in his review for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. He felt it was beneficial that ''Iron Fist'' released after ''Doctor Strange'' introduced the MCU to \"all his Eastern-mystical baggage\", and called Iron Fist \"a fresh presence\" compared to \"moody, conflicted heroism\" of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that Buck had \"no sense of connection to his subject\" as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt it was not until the sixth episode \"that you really feel the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins\" thanks to episodic director RZA who \"finally gives the show a proper sense of flair ... It's enough to make you wish they made him the showrunner.\" Jolin concluded, \"''Iron Fist'' works some fantastical flavor into the MCU's down-to-earth Defenders nook, but it needs more proper kung-fu flair than showrunner Buck allows.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" />\n\nResponding to these reviews, Jones said that \"these shows are not made for critics, they are first and foremost made for the fans ... when the fans of the Marvel Netflix world and fans of the comic books view the show through the lens of just wanting to enjoy a superhero show, then they will really enjoy what they see.\"<ref name=\"JonesMetro\" /> Jones later attributed the negative reviews to the fact that his character, \"a white American billionaire\", was similar to [[Donald Trump]] who had become \"public enemy number one, especially in the US\" between the making of the season and its release.<ref name=\"JonesTrump\" /> In an article for [[Vox (website)|Vox]], Alex Abad-Santos said Jones was just attempting to \"pass the blame\" away from himself when the real problem with the season was \"no one thought about what makes the character human\". Abad-Santos suggested that the season be a warning to others telling stories about superheroes, who he thought needed to ensure they were \"using established characters to touch on other topics\u2014mental illness, parenthood, race, trauma\u2014instead of simply rehashing old plots.\"<ref name=\"VoxReply\" />\n\n==== Fight scene criticisms ====\nFeinberg, in his review, criticized the fight sequences in the season, calling them \"weakly staged and all-too-brief, without any effort to even pretend that the show's leading man is doing any of his own stunts\" and felt \"Danny's strength and his enhanced abilities are barely explained and inconsistently depicted.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Sepinwall described the fighting in the season as \"both brief and unconvincing\", criticizing Jones' ability to perform the fights as well as the way they were filmed and edited.<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> One fight sequence, featuring 56 cuts for just 35 seconds of footage, was highlighted by some fans and critics as emblematic of the season's fight problems, with ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Christopher Hooton saying the editing created this \"disorientating, messy and ultimately not particularly impactful sequence\". He compared it to what he believed to be the superior work of Jackie Chan, citing a single take fight scene featuring that performer, as well as the fight scenes from ''Daredevil'' which \"had great success with a more considered shot selection and more minimal cutting than ''Iron Fist''\".<ref name=\"56Cuts\" />\n\nAloysius Low at [[CNET]] also compared Jones's fighting in the season to that of Chan as well as Jet Li, saying, \"There's none of that elegance I expect from a kung fu master, and he gets hit way too easily for a trained expert.\" Low also criticized the fact that Jones was unable to fight with both of his fists in the season, while noting that what he believed to be the best fight of the season was when Jones was faced with the drunken fist technique and was losing because of it with Rand only winning that fight due to \"the inevitable invincibility of [his] plot armor\".<ref name=\"cnetFights\" /> Brook H. at Pop Culture Uncovered felt that many of the season's fight scene issues stemmed from a decision to model ''Iron Fist'' on the American action films of the 1980s and 1990s, rather than updating the style of 1970s Hong Kong films: the season has \"no fluidity, variety, interesting styles, or back-and-forth between combatants. These fights were an American interpretation of martial arts, using the visage of kung fu to mask nothing more than straightforward brawling.\" Brook H.'s piece noted that Chan had extensive experience working as a stunt coordinator, but limited time working as a fight choreographer before joining the series, while a professional fight choreographer discussing the season felt the choreography was not the problem as \"I can see where the choreographers were going\" but the actors, particularly Jones, were just not skilled enough to deliver on them. The quick cut editing was also criticized, again, as well as attempts to \"slow-down [[The Wachowskis|Wachowski]]-style, only to speed right back up\" which \"failed miserably\".<ref name=\"PCUFights\" />\n\n=== Casting controversy ===\n{{See also|White savior#Appearance in television}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, Russ Burlingame noted for ComicBook.com that Marvel may have been tempted to change Danny Rand from white to a person of Asian descent, especially given that the other Marvel Netflix series ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Luke Cage'' already set a precedent of increasing diversity by exploring a female and African-America lead, respectively. However, Burlingame was against this happening, wanting to see \"the classic\" version of the character, and feeling that making the character Asian simply because he is a martial artist was itself \"quietly, subtlely racist\".<ref name=\"CastingCB\" /> This situation, of casting either a white or Asian-American actor in the role, was described as \"lose/lose\" by Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death,<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> while Albert Ching at [[Comic Book Resources]] was strictly against casting an Asian-American. He said that any extra Asian-American representation onscreen would be positive, but that he was not comfortable with the idea of the first major Asian superhero in film or television being a martial artist. Ching questioned why this discussion had not been raised with any other character, and suggested that a non-white, non-Asian actor be cast instead to avoid either issues. He highlighted the casting of [[Chloe Bennet]] and [[Ming-Na Wen]] in the MCU series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', both in \"non-stereotypical roles\", as examples of what roles he would rather have Asian-Americans be cast in.<ref name=\"CastingCBR\" />\n\nIn response to this, Keith Chow at The Nerds of Color specifically asked Marvel to cast an Asian-American in the role. Chow focused on the lack of Asian-American representation in mainstream television and films, the fact that the character's story would not have to change to accommodate this difference, and how it would stop elements of the \"white savior\" trope being depicted where a \"white-guy-is-better-at-being-Asian-than-the-Asians\".<ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> Chow did not feel it was equivalent to simply add a different Asian hero to the series such as [[Shang-Chi]] as there is a difference between the experience of an Asian character and an Asian-American, with the latter still being able to have a \"fish out of water\" storyline as Rand does in the comics. Chow disagreed that it was racist to have an Asian-American martial artist, as martial arts are a natural part of an Asian-American's heritage and would not be the only thing the character does;<ref name=\"CastingCA\" /> he gave the example of [[Daniel Wu]] in ''[[Into the Badlands (TV series)|Into the Badlands]]'', the only other Asian American lead of a mainstream martial arts series, who agreed to star in that series despite the perceived stereotypes because of the characterization beyond fighting, and because his \"culture did create kung fu, so is that a stereotype? No it's part of [my] history\". Chow started the hashtag #AAIronFist on [[Twitter]], beginning a movement that received support from \"high profile people\" such as [[Lexi Alexander]] and [[Gail Simone]].<ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" />\n\nMarvel and Netflix became aware of the movement to cast an Asian-American as Danny Rand,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC2\" /> particularly after Chow began writing on the subject in March 2014,<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /><ref name=\"CastingNoC\" /> and considered several Asian-American actors for the role.<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> This included [[Lewis Tan]], who went on to guest star as the villain [[Zhou Cheng]] in the season.<ref name=\"Tan\" /> However, by the time Buck was announced as showrunner in December 2015, the studios were \"leaning toward keeping Iron Fist white.\"<ref name=\"CastingTHR\" /> Jones, who is white, was cast in February 2016.<ref name=\"FinnJones\" />\n\nFollowing the casting, [[io9]]'s Rob Bricken spoke out against commentators who accepted Jones's casting because Marvel had been in a \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" situation, feeling this was not true because the benefits that could have come from casting an Asian-American actor\u2014including having the character \"{{em|reclaim}} his Asian heritage, instead of taking it from others\"\u2014outweighed just copying the stereotypes from the comics.<ref name=\"Castingio9\" /> His colleague Katharine Trendecosta later added, after watching the completed season, that an Asian-American Danny Rand would have been more interesting than the final version, especially in being able to explore how he felt about returning to America having become more of a stereotype, and feeling out of place in K'un Lun due to being American while feeling out of place among the high-society circles of America due to being Asian.<ref name=\"Castingio92\" /> In response to these criticisms, Jones agreed that \"there needs to be more diversity in film and television\" but was confused why ''Iron Fist'' in particular had been targeted by internet commentators and said that they should get angry at \"real problems in the world\" instead.<ref name=\"JonesVulture\" /> After the irony of him championing diversity through his Twitter account was raised with Jones in March 2017, he added that the producers chose to lean in to the problematic aspects of the character and surround him with \"one of the most diverse\" casts of the Marvel Netflix series to create a \"socially progressive story\" without alienating the comic fan base. Jones subsequently took down his Twitter account.<ref name=\"JonesTwitter\" />\n\nIn response to specific criticisms that Rand is a \"white savior\", Buck said that he had approached the character without knowing of the racial issues surrounding him and his comic history, and that \"I can say most definitively Danny Rand is no white saviour. He's trying to save himself, if anything.\"<ref name=\"BuckGoss360\" /> Jones agreed, saying, \"Danny Rand is not a white savior. Danny Rand can hardly save himself, let alone an entire race of people. He is a very complicated, vulnerable individual.\" Jones felt that changing K'un Lun to be a multi-cultural place for the series aided in lessening the white savior narrative, while stating, \"It's up to the writers to address thematic and narrative choices. And it's up to us as actors to try and breathe life into these characters as truthfully and as honestly and with [as much] genuine passion as possible.\"<ref name=\"JonesBuzzFeed\" /> [[Roy Thomas]], co-creator of the character, also defended the season following accusations of cultural appropriation, saying that the character was created for a less \"PC\" time and that K'un Lun was always meant to be a mythical place rather than a prepresentation of Asia. Thomas added that he would not be bothered if the character had been changed to Asian-American, but was not \"ashamed\" that Rand remained white.<ref name=\"RoyThomas\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe
