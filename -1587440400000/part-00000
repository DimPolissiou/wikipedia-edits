He served as a captain of a black company in the 34th Infantry Regiment [[U.S. Colored Troops]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] and received the [[Medal of Honor]]. After the war he became first a dentist and then a physician. He was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]] and then the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]]. As chairman of the Senate Health Committee he helped establish the State [[Tuberculosis]] Sanatorium at [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]].<ref>Brush Bowers, p.31-33.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrush was born in [[West Hills, New York|West Hills]], [[Huntington, New York]] in 1842. He was born in the family farmhouse that is still standing and occupied today. He left to live in [[Brooklyn]] at the age of 17. He worked in a dry goods store for $2.00 per week. Two years later when the Civil War began he was among the first to volunteer.<ref>Brush Bowers, p.33.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Civil War===\nOn August 13, 1861 George joined the 48th New York Regiment as a private and fought at the capture of [[Fort Walker (Hilton Head)|Fort Walker]] and Fort Beauregard. On June 6, 1863 he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and volunteered to serve with the newly formed 34th USCT Infantry Regiment made up of black slaves from [[South Carolina]]. He was among the first group of white officers to command a unit of all black troops. By 1865 he was a captain commanding a full company of the 34th Regiment.<ref>U.S. Colored Troops Organized In South Carolina, p.1-p.10.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Brush became a Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].  He was also a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].\n\n====Medal of Honor====\nThe 34th Infantry Regiment was ordered on May 24, 1864 on an expedition to Asheepo River, South Carolina to burn a railroad trestle across a marsh at that point. About 400 members of the black regiment were loaded onto the troop steamer ''Boston'', including 1st Lieutenant George W. Brush and the men of his company. The men had been ferried out to the ''Boston'' by small boats and one was fastened to the ships stern. Sailing down the Asheepo River in fog and darkness the ship became stranded upon an oyster bed. The [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] planted a battery of guns on the river bank and began shelling the ''Boston''. Lieutenant Brush quickly assembled four volunteers and began transporting men from the ''Boston'' to shore with the one small boat available. His Medal of Honor citation reads as follows \"voluntarily commanded a boat crew, which went to the rescue of a large number of Union soldiers on board the stranded steamer ''Boston'', and with great gallantry succeeded in conveying them to shore, being exposed during the entire time to heavy fire from a Confederate battery\". Instrumental in attaining the Medal of Honor for Lieutenant Brush were the efforts of the unit's Chaplain Homer W. Moore.<ref>Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients.</ref><ref>Beyer,W.F. & Keydel, O.F., p.347.</ref>\n\n===Dentist and physician===\nAfter the war Brush returned to Brooklyn and became a dentist. After several years as a dentist he entered [[Long Island College Hospital]] Medical School from which he graduated in 1876. He had a long and successful medical practice in Brooklyn.<ref>Brush Bowers p.28.</ref>\n\n===State legislator===\nDr. Brush was very active in Brooklyn civic and political affairs. He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (Kings Co., 7th D.) in [[118th New York State Legislature|1895]]; and a member of the [[New York State Senate]] (4th D.) from 1896 to 1898, sitting in the [[119th New York State Legislature|119th]], [[120th New York State Legislature|120th]] and [[121st New York State Legislature]]s. He was chairman of the Senate Health Committee and helped to establish the N.Y. State Tuberculosis Sanitarium at Saranac Lake.<ref>Brush Bowers p. 29.</ref>\n\nHe was also a member of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] and the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].\n\n==Personal life==\nBrush had married Alice Bowers in Huntington in 1865 while home on leave. Alice sailed from New York to Florida to join Brush seven weeks after the wedding. The steamship was caught in a storm off Cape Hatteras and sank with all on board being lost. In 1868 Brush married Marie Bowers, Alice's younger sister. They were married for fifty-eight years and had one child, a son named Herbert.\n\n==Death==\nDr. Brush died on November 16, 1927 and is buried in the Huntington Rural Cemetery in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] in Long Island, New York.<ref>Mann, Vol. LXVII.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web\n |accessdate=July 13, 2010\n |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html\n |title= Civil War (A-L); Brush, George W. entry\n |work= Medal of Honor recipients\n |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n |date= August 6, 2009\n}}\n*Beyer, W.

He served as a captain of a black company in the 34th Infantry Regiment [[U.S. Colored Troops]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] and received the [[Medal of Honor]]. After the war he became first a dentist and then a physician. He was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]] and then the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]]. As chairman of the Senate Health Committee he helped establish the State [[Tuberculosis]] Sanatorium at [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]].<ref>Brush Bowers, p.31-33.</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrush was born in [[West Hills, New York|West Hills]], [[Huntington, New York]] in 1842. He was born in the family farmhouse that is still standing and occupied today. He left to live in [[Brooklyn]] at the age of 17. He worked in a dry goods store for $2.00 per week. Two years later when the Civil War began he was among the first to volunteer.<ref>Brush Bowers, p.33.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Civil War===\nOn August 13, 1861 George joined the 48th New York Regiment as a private and fought at the capture of [[Fort Walker (Hilton Head)|Fort Walker]] and Fort Beauregard. On June 6, 1863 he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and volunteered to serve with the newly formed 34th USCT Infantry Regiment made up of black slaves from [[South Carolina]]. He was among the first group of white officers to command a unit of all black troops. By 1865 he was a captain commanding a full company of the 34th Regiment.<ref>U.S. Colored Troops Organized In South Carolina, p.1-p.10.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Brush became a Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].  He was also a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].\n\n====Medal of Honor====\nThe 34th Infantry Regiment was ordered on May 24, 1864 on an expedition to Asheepo River, South Carolina to burn a railroad trestle across a marsh at that point. About 400 members of the black regiment were loaded onto the troop steamer ''Boston'', including 1st Lieutenant George W. Brush and the men of his company. The men had been ferried out to the ''Boston'' by small boats and one was fastened to the ships stern. Sailing down the Asheepo River in fog and darkness the ship became stranded upon an oyster bed. The [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] planted a battery of guns on the river bank and began shelling the ''Boston''. Lieutenant Brush quickly assembled four volunteers and began transporting men from the ''Boston'' to shore with the one small boat available. His Medal of Honor citation reads as follows \"voluntarily commanded a boat crew, which went to the rescue of a large number of Union soldiers on board the stranded steamer ''Boston'', and with great gallantry succeeded in conveying them to shore, being exposed during the entire time to heavy fire from a Confederate battery\". Instrumental in attaining the Medal of Honor for Lieutenant Brush were the efforts of the unit's Chaplain Homer W. Moore.<ref>Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients.</ref><ref>Beyer,W.F. & Keydel, O.F., p.347.</ref>\n\n===Dentist and physician===\nAfter the war Brush returned to Brooklyn and became a dentist. After several years as a dentist he entered [[Long Island College Hospital]] Medical School from which he graduated in 1876. He had a long and successful medical practice in Brooklyn.<ref>Brush Bowers p.28.</ref>\n\n===State legislator===\nDr. Brush was very active in Brooklyn civic and political affairs. He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (Kings Co., 7th D.) in [[118th New York State Legislature|1895]]; and a member of the [[New York State Senate]] (4th D.) from 1896 to 1898, sitting in the [[119th New York State Legislature|119th]], [[120th New York State Legislature|120th]] and [[121st New York State Legislature]]s. He was chairman of the Senate Health Committee and helped to establish the N.Y. State Tuberculosis Sanitarium at Saranac Lake.<ref>Brush Bowers p. 29.</ref>\n\nHe was also a member of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] and the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].\n\n==Personal life==\nBrush had married Alice Bowers in Huntington in 1865 while home on leave. Alice sailed from New York to Florida to join Brush seven weeks after the wedding. The steamship was caught in a storm off Cape Hatteras and sank with all on board being lost. In 1868 Brush married Marie Bowers, Alice's younger sister. They were married for fifty-eight years and had one child, a son named Herbert.\n\n==Death==\nDr. Brush died on November 16, 1927 and is buried in the Huntington Rural Cemetery in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] in Long Island, New York.<ref>Mann, Vol. LXVII.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n*[[List of Medal of Honor recipients]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web\n |accessdate=July 13, 2010\n |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html\n |title= Civil War (A-L); Brush, George W. entry\n |work= Medal of Honor recipients\n |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n |date= August 6, 2009\n}}\n*Beyer, W.

The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December.

There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean\u2014the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the east of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west of India. The official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in this basin is the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), while the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] releases unofficial advisories.

cyclone]] formation. The season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between April and December. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern [[Indian Ocean]].

She has smooth, white skin and is centered against a landscape background.]]\n\n'''Oil painting''' is the process of [[painting]] with [[pigments]] with a medium of [[drying oil]] as the [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Commonly used drying oils include [[linseed oil]], [[poppy seed oil]], [[walnut oil]], and [[safflower oil]]. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the [[oil paint]], such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a [[resin]], such as pine resin or [[frankincense]], to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\n\nAlthough oil paint was first used for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] paintings by painters in central and western [[Afghanistan]] sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Carolyn|title=Earliest Oil Paintings Found in Famed Afghan Caves|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080205-afghan-paintings_2.html|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>  it did not gain popularity until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in Northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\nIn recent years, [[water miscible oil paint]] has become available. Water-soluble paints are either engineered or an [[emulsifier]] has been added that allows them to be thinned with water rather than [[paint thinner]], and allows, when sufficiently diluted, very fast drying times (1\u20133 days) when compared with traditional oils (1\u20133 weeks).\n\n==Techniques==\n[[Image:Sj\u00e4lvportr\u00e4tt av Anders Zorn 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|''Self-portrait, at work'', [[Anders Zorn]], ''1897''|alt=Painting shows a man in the foreground with a loose-fitting white outfit and a mustache holding a wooden palette with his paints. A pair of feminine legs are visible upper right.]]\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. [[Oil paint]] is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade [[mineral spirits]], or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is '[[fat over lean]]', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. \n\nThere are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint. \n\nTraditionally, paint was transferred to the painting surface using [[paintbrush]]es, but there are other methods, including using [[palette knife|palette knives]] and rags. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some [[turpentine]] for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped. Oil paint dries by [[oxidation]], not [[evaporation]], and is usually dry to the touch within a span of two weeks (some colors dry within days). It is generally dry enough to be [[varnish]]ed in six months to a year. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Buddhas of Bamiyan.jpg|alt=|thumb|The earliest discovered oil paintings (~ 650AD) depicting buddhist imagery in Bamiyan, Afghanistan]]\nThe earliest discovered oil paintings date back to approx. 650AD in Afghanistan. These murals were presumably created by buddhist artists traveling along the silk road. These early oil works display a wide range of pigments and binders, and even included the use of a final varnish layer. This refinement of this painting technique and the survival of the paintings into the present day suggests that oil paints had been used in Asia even before the 7th century. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrf.eu/news/general-old/general-2008/bamiyan|title=Synchrotron light unveils oil in ancient Buddhist paintings from Bamiyan|website=www.esrf.eu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/26/2147150.htm?section=world Afghan caves hold world's first oil paintings: expert \u2013 ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/history/080422-ancient-oils.html Earliest Oil Paintings Discovered]</ref>  It is possible, considering the history of [[tempera]] (pigment mixed with either egg whites or egg yolks, then painted on a plastered section) that oils were discovered in Europe independently around the 15th century. Outdoor surfaces and surfaces like shields\u2014both those used in tournaments and those hung as decorations\u2014were more durable when painted in oil-based media than when painted in the traditional tempera paints.\n\nMost [[Renaissance|European Renaissance]] sources, in particular [[Vasari]], credited northern European painters of the 15th century, and [[Jan van Eyck]] in particular, with the \"invention\" of painting with oil media on [[panel painting|wood panel]] supports<ref>Borchert (2008), 92\u201394</ref> (\"support\" is the technical term for the underlying backing of a painting). However, [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, ''On Various Arts'', written in 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. However, [[early Netherlandish painting]] with artists like Van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] in the 15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.\n\nEarly works were still [[panel painting]]s on wood, but around the end of the 15th century [[canvas]] became more popular as the support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of [[gesso]] (a fine type of plaster). [[Venice]], where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small [[cabinet painting]]s were also made on metal, especially copper plates.  These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from [[printmaking]] were reused for this purpose. The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based [[fresco]] for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.\n\n==Ingredients==\n[[File:Flax seeds.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flax#Flax seeds|Flax seed]] is the source of linseed oil.|alt=A close-up of glistening, golden flax seeds.]]\n\nThe linseed oil itself comes from the [[flax]] seed, a common fiber crop. [[Linen]], a \"support\" for oil painting (see relevant section), also comes from the flax plant. [[Safflower]] oil or the [[walnut]] or [[poppyseed oil]] are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they \"yellow\" less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film.  Linseed oil tends to dry yellow and can change the hue of the color.\n\nRecent advances in [[chemistry]] have produced modern [[water miscible oil paint]]s that can be used and cleaned up with water. Small alterations in the [[molecule|molecular]] structure of the oil creates this water [[miscible]] property.\n\n==Supports for oil painting==\n[[Image:Splined Canvas.jpg|thumb|[[Splined canvas]]|alt=A square canvas rests atop another with its back showing a thick frame of wood.]]\n\nTraditional artists' [[canvas]] is made from [[linen]], but less expensive [[cotton]] fabric has gained popularity. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a \"stretcher\" or \"strainer\". The difference between the two names is that ''stretchers'' are slightly adjustable, while ''strainers'' are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a \"[[sizing|size]]\" to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of [[animal glue]] (modern painters will use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a ''gesso'', a mixture of glue and chalk.\n\nModern acrylic \"[[gesso]]\" is made of [[titanium dioxide]] with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a \"sandable\" acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white.  The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible in the surface of finished paintings as a change that's not from the paint.\n\nStandard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century. The standards were used by most artists, not only the French, as it was\u2014and evidently still is\u2014supported by the main suppliers of artists' materials. Size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate \"runs\" for figures (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage'') and marines (''marine'') that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a ''0 figure'' corresponds in height with a ''paysage 1'' and a ''marine 2''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Haaf|first= Beatrix|title=Industriell vorgrundierte Malleinen.

Panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Oil painting palette.jpg|thumb|A traditional wood [[Palette (painting)|palette]] used to hold and mix small amounts of paint while working.|alt=A man's finger sticks through a hole in a large wooden palette. One of his hands is dipping a brush into the paint and the other holds numerous brushes in reserve.]]\nOil paint is made by mixing [[pigment]]s of colors with an oil medium.  Different colors are made, or purchased premixed, before painting begins, but further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities together as the painting process is underway. An [[artist's palette]], traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints of different colors. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as [[sulphide]]s for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods of time; the appearance of many old paintings today is very different from the original. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\n\nTraditionally, artists mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves and [[List of artistic media#Painting|medium]]. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the [[studio]]. This changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter [[John Goffe Rand]]'s invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841 (the year of [[Claude Monet]]'s birth). Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient [[plein air]] painting (a common approach in French [[Impressionism]]).\n\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and [[mongoose]] hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red [[sable]] brushes ([[weasel]] hair). The finest quality brushes are called \"[[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|kolinsky sable]]\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the [[Siberian weasel]]. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \"snap.\" Floppy fibers with no snap, such as [[squirrel]] hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\n\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as [[cost efficient]].\n \nBrushes come in many sizes and are used for different purposes. The ''type'' of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their [[Fingerpaint|fingers]].\n\n[[File:Tubes of paint, artist's paint PNG.png|thumb|left|Tubes of paint]]\nOil painters traditionally applied paint in layers known as \"glazes\", a method also simply called \"indirect painting\".  This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the [[egg tempera]] painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\". The first coat (the [[underpainting]]) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in [[fresco]] technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \"mosaic\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\n\nArtists in later periods, such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] era (late 19th century), often expanded on this [[wet-on-wet]] method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"[[alla prima]]\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\n\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from [[dammar gum]] crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and [[Art Conservation and Restoration|conservation]].

She has smooth, white skin and is centered against a landscape background.]]\n\n'''Oil painting''' is the process of [[painting]] with [[pigments]] with a medium of [[drying oil]] as the [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Commonly used drying oils include [[linseed oil]], [[poppy seed oil]], [[walnut oil]], and [[safflower oil]]. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the [[oil paint]], such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a [[resin]], such as pine resin or [[frankincense]], to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\n\nAlthough oil paint was first used for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] paintings by painters in central and western [[Afghanistan]] sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Carolyn|title=Earliest Oil Paintings Found in Famed Afghan Caves|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/02/080205-afghan-paintings_2.html|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>  it did not gain popularity until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in Northern Europe, and by the height of the [[Renaissance]] oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of [[tempera]] paints in the majority of Europe.\n\nIn recent years, [[water miscible oil paint]] has become available. Water-soluble paints are either engineered or an [[emulsifier]] has been added that allows them to be thinned with water rather than [[paint thinner]], and allows, when sufficiently diluted, very fast drying times (1\u20133 days) when compared with traditional oils (1\u20133 weeks).\n\n==Techniques==\n[[Image:Sj\u00e4lvportr\u00e4tt av Anders Zorn 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|''Self-portrait, at work'', [[Anders Zorn]], ''1897''|alt=Painting shows a man in the foreground with a loose-fitting white outfit and a mustache holding a wooden palette with his paints. A pair of feminine legs are visible upper right.]]\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. [[Oil paint]] is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade [[mineral spirits]], or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is '[[fat over lean]]', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. \n\nThere are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint. \n\nTraditionally, paint was transferred to the painting surface using [[paintbrush]]es, but there are other methods, including using [[palette knife|palette knives]] and rags. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some [[turpentine]] for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped. Oil paint dries by [[oxidation]], not [[evaporation]], and is usually dry to the touch within a span of two weeks (some colors dry within days). It is generally dry enough to be [[varnish]]ed in six months to a year. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Buddhas of Bamiyan.jpg|alt=|thumb|The earliest discovered oil paintings (~ 650AD) depicting buddhist imagery in Bamiyan, Afghanistan]]\nThe earliest discovered oil paintings date back to approx. 650AD in Afghanistan. These murals were presumably created by buddhist artists traveling along the silk road. These early oil works display a wide range of pigments and binders, and even included the use of a final varnish layer. This refinement of this painting technique and the survival of the paintings into the present day suggests that oil paints had been used in Asia even before the 7th century. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrf.eu/news/general-old/general-2008/bamiyan|title=Synchrotron light unveils oil in ancient Buddhist paintings from Bamiyan|website=www.esrf.eu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/26/2147150.htm?section=world Afghan caves hold world's first oil paintings: expert \u2013 ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref><ref>[http://www.livescience.com/history/080422-ancient-oils.html Earliest Oil Paintings Discovered]</ref>  It is possible, considering the history of [[tempera]] (pigment mixed with either egg whites or egg yolks, then painted on a plastered section) that oils were discovered in Europe independently around the 15th century. Outdoor surfaces and surfaces like shields\u2014both those used in tournaments and those hung as decorations\u2014were more durable when painted in oil-based media than when painted in the traditional tempera paints.\n\nMost [[Renaissance|European Renaissance]] sources, in particular [[Vasari]], credited northern European painters of the 15th century, and [[Jan van Eyck]] in particular, with the \"invention\" of painting with oil media on [[panel painting|wood panel]] supports<ref>Borchert (2008), 92\u201394</ref> (\"support\" is the technical term for the underlying backing of a painting). However, [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, ''On Various Arts'', written in 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. However, [[early Netherlandish painting]] with artists like Van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] in the 15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.\n\nEarly works were still [[panel painting]]s on wood, but around the end of the 15th century [[canvas]] became more popular as the support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of [[gesso]] (a fine type of plaster). [[Venice]], where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small [[cabinet painting]]s were also made on metal, especially copper plates.  These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from [[printmaking]] were reused for this purpose. The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based [[fresco]] for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.\n\n==Ingredients==\n[[File:Flax seeds.jpg|thumb|left|[[Flax#Flax seeds|Flax seed]] is the source of linseed oil.|alt=A close-up of glistening, golden flax seeds.]]\n\nThe linseed oil itself comes from the [[flax]] seed, a common fiber crop. [[Linen]], a \"support\" for oil painting (see relevant section), also comes from the flax plant. [[Safflower]] oil or the [[walnut]] or [[poppyseed oil]] are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they \"yellow\" less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film.  Linseed oil tends to dry yellow and can change the hue of the color.\n\nRecent advances in [[chemistry]] have produced modern [[water miscible oil paint]]s that can be used and cleaned up with water. Small alterations in the [[molecule|molecular]] structure of the oil creates this water [[miscible]] property.\n\n==Supports for oil painting==\n[[Image:Splined Canvas.jpg|thumb|[[Splined canvas]]|alt=A square canvas rests atop another with its back showing a thick frame of wood.]]\n\nTraditional artists' [[canvas]] is made from [[linen]], but less expensive [[cotton]] fabric has gained popularity. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a \"stretcher\" or \"strainer\". The difference between the two names is that ''stretchers'' are slightly adjustable, while ''strainers'' are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a \"[[sizing|size]]\" to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of [[animal glue]] (modern painters will use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a ''gesso'', a mixture of glue and chalk.\n\nModern acrylic \"[[gesso]]\" is made of [[titanium dioxide]] with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a \"sandable\" acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white.  The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible in the surface of finished paintings as a change that's not from the paint.\n\nStandard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century. The standards were used by most artists, not only the French, as it was\u2014and evidently still is\u2014supported by the main suppliers of artists' materials. Size 0 (''toile de 0'') to size 120 (''toile de 120'') is divided in separate \"runs\" for figures (''figure''), landscapes (''paysage'') and marines (''marine'') that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a ''0 figure'' corresponds in height with a ''paysage 1'' and a ''marine 2''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Haaf|first= Beatrix|title=Industriell vorgrundierte Malleinen.

Panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Oil painting palette.jpg|thumb|A traditional wood [[Palette (painting)|palette]] used to hold and mix small amounts of paint while working.|alt=A man's finger sticks through a hole in a large wooden palette. One of his hands is dipping a brush into the paint and the other holds numerous brushes in reserve.]]\nOil paint is made by mixing [[pigment]]s of colors with an oil medium.  Different colors are made, or purchased premixed, before painting begins, but further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities together as the painting process is underway. An [[artist's palette]], traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints of different colors. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as [[sulphide]]s for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods of time; the appearance of many old paintings today is very different from the original. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\n\nTraditionally, artists mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves and [[List of artistic media#Painting|medium]]. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the [[studio]]. This changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter [[John Goffe Rand]]'s invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841 (the year of [[Claude Monet]]'s birth). Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient [[plein air]] painting (a common approach in French [[Impressionism]]).\n\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and [[mongoose]] hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red [[sable]] brushes ([[weasel]] hair). The finest quality brushes are called \"[[Kolinsky sable-hair brush|kolinsky sable]]\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the [[Siberian weasel]]. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \"snap.\" Floppy fibers with no snap, such as [[squirrel]] hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\n\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as [[cost efficient]].\n \nBrushes come in many sizes and are used for different purposes. The ''type'' of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \"round\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \"Flat\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \"Bright\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for \"scrubbing in\". \"Filbert\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \"Egbert\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their [[Fingerpaint|fingers]].\n\n[[File:Tubes of paint, artist's paint PNG.png|thumb|left|Tubes of paint]]\nOil painters traditionally applied paint in layers known as \"glazes\", a method also simply called \"indirect painting\".  This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the [[egg tempera]] painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \"mixed technique\" or \"mixed method\". The first coat (the [[underpainting]]) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \"tone\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \"cartooning\" method used in [[fresco]] technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \"mosaic\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \"mosaic\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\n\nArtists in later periods, such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] era (late 19th century), often expanded on this [[wet-on-wet]] method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \"[[alla prima]]\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\n\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from [[dammar gum]] crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and [[Art Conservation and Restoration|conservation]]. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.\n\n==Examples of famous works==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"140px\" heights=\"160px\">\nImage:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', [[Jan van Eyck]], ''1434'' (on panel)\nImage:La donna velata v2.jpg|''[[La velata|La donna velata]]'', [[Raphael]], ''1516''\nImage:Tizian_085.jpg|''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'', [[Titian]], ''1562''\nImage:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''1610\u201311''\nImage:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg| ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', [[Rembrandt]], ''1632''\nImage:Innocent-x-velazquez.jpg| ''[[Portrait of Innocent X|Innocent X]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], ''c 1650''\nImage:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'', [[Johannes Vermeer]], ''1658\u20131660''\nImage:The_Toilet_of_Venus,_by_Fran\u00e7ois_Boucher.jpg| ''The Toilet of Venus'', [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''1751''\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg| ''[[The Blue Boy]]'', Thomas Gainsborough, ''1770''\nImage:Battle of Somosierra by Piotr Micha\u0142owski.PNG|''[[Battle of Somosierra]]'', [[Piotr Micha\u0142owski]], 1837\nImage:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', [[Claude Monet]], ''1875''\nImage:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg| ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] ''1876''\nImage:Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpg|''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''1890''\nImage:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1892-95, Les joueurs de carte (The Card Players), 60 x 73 cm, oil on canvas, Courtauld Institute of Art, London.jpg|''[[The Card Players]]'', [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''1892''\nImage:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|''[[The Old Guitarist]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1903\nImage:Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon.jpg|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]], 1907\nImage:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 7.jpg|''Composition VII'', [[Wassily Kandinsky]], ''1913''\nImage:Chagall Bella.jpg| ''[[Bella with White Collar]]'', [[Marc Chagall]], ''1917''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wikibooks|Introduction to Art}}\n{{commons category|Oil paintings}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Britannica|426194|Oil painting}}\n* Chieffo, Clifford T.:Contemporary Oil Painter's Handbook, Prentice Hall, 1976\n* Borchert, Till-Holger.

Asuka was born in Germany to an unknown American father and a Japanese-German mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu. She strikes a friendship with [[Hikari Horaki]], the class representative, and while she initially tries to befriend [[Rei Ayanami]] as well, she eventually develops deep antipathy towards her. She also develops a distaste towards Shinji's friends, [[Touji Suzuhara|Touji]] and [[Kensuke Aida|Kensuke]]. Asuka also has a crush for her older guardian from before arriving in Tokyo-3, [[Kaji Ryoji]], as Asuka believes she is a mature woman and seeks recognition from him. Kaji, however, politely refuses Asuka's advances, tries to get Asuka closer to Shinji and also eventually rekindles his relationship with [[Misato Katsuragi|Misato]].\n\nFrom episode 9 onwards, Asuka lives with Shinji under Misato's care and the two get to know each other better. Asuka starts calling him \"baka-Shinji\", \"stupid Shinji\". Asuka continuously teases him about his passivity and perceived lack of manliness, but gradually comes to respect and like him as they fight Angels together. This culminates in Asuka kissing Shinji in episode 15 at her provocation, however Shinji's lack of reaction angers Asuka, and she starts to develop resentment at Shinji's growing skills, as Asuka believes Shinji is undeserving of this success since Asuka has trained her whole life for piloting, unlike Shinji. She expresses frustration at Shinji's passivity, but continues to care for him. After first being defeated in battle by [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Zeruel|Zeruel]] in an attempt to regain her status as the best pilot, Asuka's self-confidence (and, correspondingly, her synch ratio and effectiveness as a pilot) begins to dwindle.\n\nThis comes to a head in episode 22, when the Angel [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Arael|Arael]] attacks and Asuka, burdened by increasingly poor results in synchronization tests, is infuriated by being ordered to serve as backup to Rei. She defies orders and tries to attack the Angel alone, but is overwhelmed by a psychological attack by the Angel.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Don't Be|airdate=1996-02-28|number=22|credits=Director: Akira Takamura, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Hiroshi Yamaguchi|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}</ref> Asuka is forced to relive memories of her childhood trauma of seeing her mother unable to recognize her and instead associating her with a doll as her father has an affair with her mother's doctor, her future stepmother. Asuka's mother eventually hangs herself on the day she is chosen as an Evangelion pilot. In response to this, Asuka proclaims she will no longer need anybody and is not a child anymore, but she is also confronted with her perceived abandonment by [[Kaji Ryoji|Kaji]] and rejection by Shinji, as multiple scenes of her earlier in the series teasing him or showing resistance are revealed to have been attempts to provoke Shinji into reaching out to her.

In the alternate world sequence in episode 26, Asuka wakes up Shinji in his room, and is his childhood friend in a more mundane version of Tokyo-3.\n\n===In ''The End of Evangelion'' film===\nIn ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'', as the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Force invade NERV, Asuka is placed inside Unit 02, which is submerged in a lake within the Geofront, for her protection. As she is bombarded by depth charges, Asuka wakes up declares that she refuses to die, and in a moment of clarity, realizes that her mother's soul is within the Eva and has been protecting her all along. Her self-identity regained, she emerges and defeats the JSSDF, before encountering the Mass-Produced Evas. She reluctantly asks Shinji for support, however he is unable to reach her in time. Though she successfully disables all nine opponents, Unit 02's power running out and the infinite power of the Mass-Produced Evas' S\u00b2 Engines (which allow them to remain functional despite being severely damaged or mutilated) finally allow them to eviscerate and dismember Unit 02 using their Lance of Longinus replicas. Seeing Asuka's destroyed Evangelion makes Shinji go on a frenzy, which eventually culminates in him starting Third Impact. Shinji and Asuka have an extended dream-like sequence inside Instrumentality. Asuka claims she can't stand the sight of him, but Shinji responds that it is because he is just like her. Asuka then states she knows Shinji masturbated to her exposed breasts in the beginning of the movie. Asuka makes an ultimatum to Shinji as she says he wants him all to herself, and her body is sexualized before his eyes as he deals with his attraction towards her. Shinji claims he wants to understand Asuka, but she refuses. Shinji replies that Asuka will not say anything to him, which makes understanding her impossible. Shinji, in a scene reminiscent of their kiss during the series, tells Asuka he wants to help her and stay with her forever, but Asuka refuses, stating he has never truly loved anyone and is only looking at her as comfort. Shinji is furious at this rejection, and lashes out by choking her.<ref>\"It's one of the most intense scenes in the film, and a perverse subversion of the dynamic between these two in the series. Asuka tells Shinji he wants her because he\u2019s scared of Misato and Rei. She is the most accessible to him, so he tries to channel his affection towards her, but does he really care for her? It\u2019s a question he can\u2019t really answer, and all his uncertain feelings about women get wrapped up in this awful mess that leads him to choke Asuka. It's intense and hard to watch. This is the ostensible hero of the piece and he\u2019s caught in this psychological hell, choking the heroine to death. This leads into the trippy reality bending sequence that brings the film towards its climax\". Meaney, 2008</ref>\n\nAfter Shinji rejects Instrumentality, she is the second person to return some time after Shinji in the film's [[The End of Evangelion#The final sequence|final scene]], her injuries sustained in battle against the Mass-Produced Evas covered in bandages.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], [[Hideaki Anno]] (directors) | title = [[The End of Evangelion]] |type=Film| publisher = [[Toei Company, Ltd.]] |date = 1997}}</ref> Shinji begins to strangle the seemingly comatose Asuka, but stops when she caresses his face in a manner reminiscent of Yui's, Shinji's mother, earlier caress. She then says one of her most famous sentences: 'Kimochi warui' (\"I feel sick\" or \"How disgusting\") with a cold voice.\n\n===In ''Rebuild of Evangelion'' film series===\nIn the four-film re-imagining of the TV series, Asuka makes her first appearance in the second film, ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]''. Several changes have been made to her character, such as her family name being changed from {{nihongo|[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]|\u60e3\u6d41}} to {{nihongo|[[Japanese destroyer Shikinami (1929)|Shikinami]]|\u5f0f\u6ce2}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evangelion.co.jp/chara.html |script-title=ja:\u300c\u30f1\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30f2\u30f3\u65b0\u5287\u5834\u7248\uff1a\u7834\u300d\u4f5c\u54c1\u60c5\u5831\u3000-\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb- |language=Japanese |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216032411/http://www.evangelion.co.jp/chara.html |archivedate=February 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> continuing the [[Ayanami class destroyer|Japanese maritime vessel]] naming convention, and rather than her having a college degree, she holds the rank of captain in the European air force, as a fighter pilot.<ref name=\"Studio Khara\">{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]] | type =  Film | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2009}}</ref> She also doesn't share Soryu's [[wikt:pediophobia|pediophobia]], and no longer has the same infatuation with Kaji, choosing to ignore an invitation to go on a trip with him until [[Misato Katsuragi|Misato]] forced her to go. Shikinami is also more reserved than Sohryu, and doesn't form a friendship with Hikari.\n\nShikinami arrives in Tokyo-3 defeating the 7th Angel by herself with ease. She introduces herself to Shinji, Touji and Kensuke but takes an immediate dislike to Rei. Asuka is seen playing with a hand puppet and telling herself she is special and has always been alone. Before fighting the 8th Angel, Asuka is unable to sleep due to anxiety, and she goes to Shinji's room and has a talk with him laying by his side, asking him why he pilots the Eva. Asuka attempts to learn how to cook in order to impress Shinji, but once she realizes Rei has been doing the same, Asuka asks her what Shinji means to her. Asuka storms out of the elevator but lets Rei hold a party for Shinji and Gendo. While Misato is having dinner with Kaji, she talks with Asuka on the cellphone as she describes how she's now more willing to talk to people. Asuka has decided to be the test pilot of [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA03|Evangelion Unit 03]] (whereas [[Touji Suzuhara|Touji]] had such a role in the original series) in order to avoid Rei's party. Unit 03 is taken over by the 9th Angel, and Shinji refuses to engage it. Asuka survives Unit 03's destruction at the hands of the Dummy Plug system, but is last seen in urgent care.\n\nIn the [[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo|third film]], Asuka is initially part of the rescue operation for Unit 01, which is stranded in space, and is now working together with [[Mari Makinami|Mari]] supporting her piloting [[Evangelion (mecha)|Unit 08]]. After fighting off an initial attack by Nerv, Asuka confronts Shinji in his holding cell and tells him 14 years have passed. Asuka is biologically 28 years old but hasn't physically aged thanks to what she calls \"The Curse of Eva\", and she's wearing an [[eyepatch]] which glows blue with the same symbols as Shinji's DSS Choker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.evageeks.org/Angel-Sealing_Hex_Glyphs|title=Angel-Sealing Hex Glyphs - EvaWiki - An Evangelion Wiki - EvaGeeks.org|website=wiki.evageeks.org|access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref> This surprises Shinji, and she treats him coldly when Shinji asks about what happened to Rei. When Nerv attacks again, Shinji escapes from Wille with a Rei clone to Nerv, Asuka observes his departure and claims Shinji \"isn't even an idiot. He's just a brat.\" Later on in the movie, Asuka returns and changes her usual nickname for him for ''gaki-Shinji,'' \"brat Shinji\".\n\nAsuka, again supported by Mari, confronts Shinji and Kaworu in Terminal Dogma and is flabbergast to see Shinji piloting Unit-13. When Shinji tells Asuka he wants to pull the Spears, she asks Shinji if he's trying to start another Impact, but Shinji tells Asuka she doesn't know anything and they start fighting. When Shinji pulls the Spears of Longinus and starts Fourth Impact, Asuka has her battery recharged and quickly moves in to protect the Wunder from [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Mark 09|Mark.09]]. Asuka activates \"Code 777\" and her Eva metamorphoses into a feline form, while Asuka herself grows fangs. Without time or energy to properly defeat Mark.09, Asuka self-destructs her Eva in order to save the Wunder. Later, an exhausted Asuka opens the hatch on Shinji's entry plug. Asuka briefly complains that Shinji didn't come to rescue her and is running away from his problems and, irritated at his lack of response, starts walking away, before turning back and extracting Shinji physically, as he refuses to move. Rei appears and Asuka nonchalantly assumes she's an \"original Ayanami Type\". Asuka grabs Shinji's wrist and they start moving along the ruins of Tokyo-3, followed by Rei.\n\n===In other media===\n[[Image:NGEvol4Japanese.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Asuka on the cover of Volume 4 of the manga (Japanese printing).]]\nAsuka also appears in many manga series based on the anime, including ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' by [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]]. The events in this manga series mirror those of the anime with some divergences apparent. Asuka appears as a main character in the series and is depicted, for the most part, similar to her anime counterpart. Asuka appears in various other manga spin-offs including the ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|Shinji Ikari Raising Project]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse]]'' with varying changes to her personality and characterization, including more romantic stories like ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]''. Asuka is usually more psychologically stable. Most of these portray Asuka as Shinji's childhood friend, similarly to the alternative universe from episode 26, and have her fight for Shinji's attentions with other characters, mainly Rei. She is older and more mature in ''Evangelion ANIMA'', having developed a strong friendship with Shinji and even Rei.\n\nAsuka also makes appearances in various video games alongside other ''Evangelion'' characters such as in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] as well as the popular cross-over video game franchise ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'', where she often butts heads with the equally hot-headed and intelligent [[Kouji Kabuto]], the pilot of ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' and ''[[Mazinkaiser]]''. Asuka is a potential romantic option in all Evangelion videogames that include such an option, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd|Girlfriend of Steel 2nd]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|Shinji Ikari Raising Project]]'', often, but not always, alongside Rei and other characters. A number of official art and merchandising depicts her an Shinji in romantic situations, similar to other characters. She is also implied to have developed crushes on famous heroes such as [[Char Aznable]] (in the guise of Quattro Bageena) and [[Amuro Ray]]. However, in ''Super Robot Wars Alpha'', Asuka jealously seizes a bouquet of roses from Shinji meant for [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]]. In ''[[Super Robot Wars Alpha 3]]'', she snaps Shinji out of his depressed state during the battle with the Mass-Produced Evas by declaring that she could not be with someone who would simply lie down and die.\n\nAsuka appears in the crossover ''[[Transformers x Evangelion]]''. She piloted Ava-1 to intercept the Angel possessed [[Starscream]] calling himself Angel-scream, her Ava was scanned by the Autobot leader [[Optimus Prime]] and he gains her Ava's size and colors, she with the help of Optimus Prime and the other Autobots defeat Angel-scream<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_%C3%97_Evangelion | title=Transformers \u00d7 Evangelion - Transformers Wiki}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Popularity===\nIn a ''[[Newtype]]'' poll from March 2010, Asuka was voted as the third most popular female anime character from the 1990s.<ref name=\"NT Research\"/> The June 2010 issue of ''[[Newtype]]'' ranked Asuka Shikinami Langley No. 8 in its monthly top 10 character survey. <!-- for english speakers, see http://animecornerstore.blogspot.com/2010/06/evangelion-girls-back-on-top.html --> One reviewer describes her fatal flaw as \"excessive Pride\", noting that her mother goes insane after taking a test pilot experience on herself just as Asuka suffers a mental breakdown or contamination when challenging the 16th Angel herself.<ref>\"An extrapolation of these verses also incorporates the eventual similar 'fate' and punishment of parents and children.

Asuka was born in Germany to an unknown American father and a Japanese-German mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu. She strikes a friendship with [[Hikari Horaki]], the class representative, and while she initially tries to befriend [[Rei Ayanami]] as well, she eventually develops deep antipathy towards her. She also develops a distaste towards Shinji's friends, [[Touji Suzuhara|Touji]] and [[Kensuke Aida|Kensuke]]. Asuka also has a crush for her older guardian from before arriving in Tokyo-3, [[Kaji Ryoji]], as Asuka believes she is a mature woman and seeks recognition from him. Kaji, however, politely refuses Asuka's advances, tries to get Asuka closer to Shinji and also eventually rekindles his relationship with [[Misato Katsuragi|Misato]].\n\nFrom episode 9 onwards, Asuka lives with Shinji under Misato's care and the two get to know each other better. Asuka starts calling him \"baka-Shinji\", \"stupid Shinji\". Asuka continuously teases him about his passivity and perceived lack of manliness, but gradually comes to respect and like him as they fight Angels together. This culminates in Asuka kissing Shinji in episode 15 at her provocation, however Shinji's lack of reaction angers Asuka, and she starts to develop resentment at Shinji's growing skills, as Asuka believes Shinji is undeserving of this success since Asuka has trained her whole life for piloting, unlike Shinji. She expresses frustration at Shinji's passivity, but continues to care for him. After first being defeated in battle by [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Zeruel|Zeruel]] in an attempt to regain her status as the best pilot, Asuka's self-confidence (and, correspondingly, her synch ratio and effectiveness as a pilot) begins to dwindle.\n\nThis comes to a head in episode 22, when the Angel [[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)#Arael|Arael]] attacks and Asuka, burdened by increasingly poor results in synchronization tests, is infuriated by being ordered to serve as backup to Rei. She defies orders and tries to attack the Angel alone, but is overwhelmed by a psychological attack by the Angel.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Don't Be|airdate=1996-02-28|number=22|credits=Director: Akira Takamura, Writers:Hideaki Anno, Hiroshi Yamaguchi|series=Neon Genesis Evangelion|network=TV Tokyo}}</ref> Asuka is forced to relive memories of her childhood trauma of seeing her mother unable to recognize her and instead associating her with a doll as her father has an affair with her mother's doctor, her future stepmother. Asuka's mother eventually hangs herself on the day she is chosen as an Evangelion pilot. In response to this, Asuka proclaims she will no longer need anybody and is not a child anymore, but she is also confronted with her perceived abandonment by [[Kaji Ryoji|Kaji]] and rejection by Shinji, as multiple scenes of her earlier in the series teasing him or showing resistance are revealed to have been attempts to provoke Shinji into reaching out to her.

In the alternate world sequence in episode 26, Asuka wakes up Shinji in his room, and is his childhood friend in a more mundane version of Tokyo-3.\n\n===In ''The End of Evangelion'' film===\nIn ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'', as the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Force invade NERV, Asuka is placed inside Unit 02, which is submerged in a lake within the Geofront, for her protection. As she is bombarded by depth charges, Asuka wakes up declares that she refuses to die, and in a moment of clarity, realizes that her mother's soul is within the Eva and has been protecting her all along. Her self-identity regained, she emerges and defeats the JSSDF, before encountering the Mass-Produced Evas. She reluctantly asks Shinji for support, however he is unable to reach her in time. Though she successfully disables all nine opponents, Unit 02's power running out and the infinite power of the Mass-Produced Evas' S\u00b2 Engines (which allow them to remain functional despite being severely damaged or mutilated) finally allow them to eviscerate and dismember Unit 02 using their Lance of Longinus replicas. Seeing Asuka's destroyed Evangelion makes Shinji go on a frenzy, which eventually culminates in him starting Third Impact. Shinji and Asuka have an extended dream-like sequence inside Instrumentality. Asuka claims she can't stand the sight of him, but Shinji responds that it is because he is just like her. Asuka then states she knows Shinji masturbated to her exposed breasts in the beginning of the movie. Asuka makes an ultimatum to Shinji as she says he wants him all to herself, and her body is sexualized before his eyes as he deals with his attraction towards her. Shinji claims he wants to understand Asuka, but she refuses. Shinji replies that Asuka will not say anything to him, which makes understanding her impossible. Shinji, in a scene reminiscent of their kiss during the series, tells Asuka he wants to help her and stay with her forever, but Asuka refuses, stating he has never truly loved anyone and is only looking at her as comfort. Shinji is furious at this rejection, and lashes out by choking her.<ref>\"It's one of the most intense scenes in the film, and a perverse subversion of the dynamic between these two in the series. Asuka tells Shinji he wants her because he\u2019s scared of Misato and Rei. She is the most accessible to him, so he tries to channel his affection towards her, but does he really care for her? It\u2019s a question he can\u2019t really answer, and all his uncertain feelings about women get wrapped up in this awful mess that leads him to choke Asuka. It's intense and hard to watch. This is the ostensible hero of the piece and he\u2019s caught in this psychological hell, choking the heroine to death. This leads into the trippy reality bending sequence that brings the film towards its climax\". Meaney, 2008</ref>\n\nAfter Shinji rejects Instrumentality, she is the second person to return some time after Shinji in the film's [[The End of Evangelion#The final sequence|final scene]], her injuries sustained in battle against the Mass-Produced Evas covered in bandages.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], [[Hideaki Anno]] (directors) | title = [[The End of Evangelion]] |type=Film| publisher = [[Toei Company, Ltd.]] |date = 1997}}</ref> Shinji begins to strangle the seemingly comatose Asuka, but stops when she caresses his face in a manner reminiscent of Yui's, Shinji's mother, earlier caress. She then says one of her most famous sentences: 'Kimochi warui' (\"I feel sick\" or \"How disgusting\") with a cold voice.\n\n===In ''Rebuild of Evangelion'' film series===\nIn the four-film re-imagining of the TV series, Asuka makes her first appearance in the second film, ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]''. Several changes have been made to her character, such as her family name being changed from {{nihongo|[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]|\u60e3\u6d41}} to {{nihongo|[[Japanese destroyer Shikinami (1929)|Shikinami]]|\u5f0f\u6ce2}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evangelion.co.jp/chara.html |script-title=ja:\u300c\u30f1\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30f2\u30f3\u65b0\u5287\u5834\u7248\uff1a\u7834\u300d\u4f5c\u54c1\u60c5\u5831\u3000-\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb- |language=Japanese |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216032411/http://www.evangelion.co.jp/chara.html |archivedate=February 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> continuing the [[Ayanami class destroyer|Japanese maritime vessel]] naming convention, and rather than her having a college degree, she holds the rank of captain in the European air force, as a fighter pilot.<ref name=\"Studio Khara\">{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]] | type =  Film | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2009}}</ref> She also doesn't share Soryu's [[wikt:pediophobia|pediophobia]], and no longer has the same infatuation with Kaji, choosing to ignore an invitation to go on a trip with him until [[Misato Katsuragi|Misato]] forced her to go. Shikinami is also more reserved than Sohryu, and doesn't form a friendship with Hikari.\n\nShikinami arrives in Tokyo-3 defeating the 7th Angel by herself with ease. She introduces herself to Shinji, Touji and Kensuke but takes an immediate dislike to Rei. Asuka is seen playing with a hand puppet and telling herself she is special and has always been alone. Before fighting the 8th Angel, Asuka is unable to sleep due to anxiety, and she goes to Shinji's room and has a talk with him laying by his side, asking him why he pilots the Eva. Asuka attempts to learn how to cook in order to impress Shinji, but once she realizes Rei has been doing the same, Asuka asks her what Shinji means to her. Asuka storms out of the elevator but lets Rei hold a party for Shinji and Gendo. While Misato is having dinner with Kaji, she talks with Asuka on the cellphone as she describes how she's now more willing to talk to people. Asuka has decided to be the test pilot of [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA03|Evangelion Unit 03]] (whereas [[Touji Suzuhara|Touji]] had such a role in the original series) in order to avoid Rei's party. Unit 03 is taken over by the 9th Angel, and Shinji refuses to engage it. Asuka survives Unit 03's destruction at the hands of the Dummy Plug system, but is last seen in urgent care.\n\nIn the [[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo|third film]], Asuka is initially part of the rescue operation for Unit 01, which is stranded in space, and is now working together with [[Mari Makinami|Mari]] supporting her piloting [[Evangelion (mecha)|Unit 08]]. After fighting off an initial attack by Nerv, Asuka confronts Shinji in his holding cell and tells him 14 years have passed. Asuka is biologically 28 years old but hasn't physically aged thanks to what she calls \"The Curse of Eva\", and she's wearing an [[eyepatch]] which glows blue with the same symbols as Shinji's DSS Choker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.evageeks.org/Angel-Sealing_Hex_Glyphs|title=Angel-Sealing Hex Glyphs - EvaWiki - An Evangelion Wiki - EvaGeeks.org|website=wiki.evageeks.org|access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref> This surprises Shinji, and she treats him coldly when Shinji asks about what happened to Rei. When Nerv attacks again, Shinji escapes from Wille with a Rei clone to Nerv, Asuka observes his departure and claims Shinji \"isn't even an idiot. He's just a brat.\" Later on in the movie, Asuka returns and changes her usual nickname for him for ''gaki-Shinji,'' \"brat Shinji\".\n\nAsuka, again supported by Mari, confronts Shinji and Kaworu in Terminal Dogma and is flabbergast to see Shinji piloting Unit-13. When Shinji tells Asuka he wants to pull the Spears, she asks Shinji if he's trying to start another Impact, but Shinji tells Asuka she doesn't know anything and they start fighting. When Shinji pulls the Spears of Longinus and starts Fourth Impact, Asuka has her battery recharged and quickly moves in to protect the Wunder from [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Mark 09|Mark.09]]. Asuka activates \"Code 777\" and her Eva metamorphoses into a feline form, while Asuka herself grows fangs. Without time or energy to properly defeat Mark.09, Asuka self-destructs her Eva in order to save the Wunder. Later, an exhausted Asuka opens the hatch on Shinji's entry plug. Asuka briefly complains that Shinji didn't come to rescue her and is running away from his problems and, irritated at his lack of response, starts walking away, before turning back and extracting Shinji physically, as he refuses to move. Rei appears and Asuka nonchalantly assumes she's an \"original Ayanami Type\". Asuka grabs Shinji's wrist and they start moving along the ruins of Tokyo-3, followed by Rei.\n\n===In other media===\n[[Image:NGEvol4Japanese.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Asuka on the cover of Volume 4 of the manga (Japanese printing).]]\nAsuka also appears in many manga series based on the anime, including ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' by [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]]. The events in this manga series mirror those of the anime with some divergences apparent. Asuka appears as a main character in the series and is depicted, for the most part, similar to her anime counterpart. Asuka appears in various other manga spin-offs including the ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|Shinji Ikari Raising Project]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse]]'' with varying changes to her personality and characterization, including more romantic stories like ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]''. Asuka is usually more psychologically stable. Most of these portray Asuka as Shinji's childhood friend, similarly to the alternative universe from episode 26, and have her fight for Shinji's attentions with other characters, mainly Rei. She is older and more mature in ''Evangelion ANIMA'', having developed a strong friendship with Shinji and even Rei.\n\nAsuka also makes appearances in various video games alongside other ''Evangelion'' characters such as in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] as well as the popular cross-over video game franchise ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'', where she often butts heads with the equally hot-headed and intelligent [[Kouji Kabuto]], the pilot of [[Mazinger Z]] and [[Mazinkaiser]]. Asuka is a potential romantic option in all Evangelion videogames that include such an option, such as [[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd|Girlfriend of Steel 2nd]] and [[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|Shinji Ikari Raising Project]], often, but not always, alongside Rei and other characters. A number of official art and merchandising depicts her an Shinji in romantic situations, similar to other characters. She is also implied to have developed crushes on famous heroes such as [[Char Aznable]] (in the guise of Quattro Bageena) and [[Amuro Ray]]. However, in ''Super Robot Wars Alpha'', Asuka jealously seizes a bouquet of roses from Shinji meant for [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]]. In ''[[Super Robot Wars Alpha 3]]'', she snaps Shinji out of his depressed state during the battle with the Mass-Produced Evas by declaring that she could not be with someone who would simply lie down and die.\n\nAsuka appears in the crossover [[Transformers x Evangelion]]. She piloted Ava-1 to intercept the Angel possessed [[Starscream]] calling himself Angel-scream, her Ava was scanned by the Autobot leader [[Optimus Prime]] and he gains her Ava's size and colors, she with the help of Optimus Prime and the other Autobots defeat Angel-scream<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_%C3%97_Evangelion | title=Transformers \u00d7 Evangelion - Transformers Wiki}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Popularity===\nIn a ''[[Newtype]]'' poll from March 2010, Asuka was voted as the third most popular female anime character from the 1990s.<ref name=\"NT Research\"/> The June 2010 issue of ''[[Newtype]]'' ranked Asuka Shikinami Langley No. 8 in its monthly top 10 character survey. <!-- for english speakers, see http://animecornerstore.blogspot.com/2010/06/evangelion-girls-back-on-top.html --> One reviewer describes her fatal flaw as \"excessive Pride\", noting that her mother goes insane after taking a test pilot experience on herself just as Asuka suffers a mental breakdown or contamination when challenging the 16th Angel herself.<ref>\"An extrapolation of these verses also incorporates the eventual similar 'fate' and punishment of parents and children. With this in mind, the seeming parallels are shocking:...Asuka's mother, after direct (1st level) contact with an Angel, goes 'insane' and eventually kills herself. Asuka, after direct contact with the 16th Angel, as well as an extremely wounded hubris (excessive Pride), has a complete mental breakdown and attempts to commit suicide, but fails; she is effectively 'dead.'\" Kenneth Lee, [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/1998-09-09 \"The Thin Veneer Known as \"Evangelion\"\"], ''ANN''; Lee also describes Asuka in one scene as \"completely misanthropic\".</ref> Mike Crandol, also of ANN, states that \"Again it is Asuka that it is most interesting to consider in this [semi-romantic] light. Sensing a kindred soul beneath her aggressive exterior (or perhaps admiring the determination he lacks), Shinji comes to love her, but does not know how to express it. Likewise, it is hinted that Asuka has similarly romantic feelings for Shinji, but her ego prevents her from admitting it even to herself.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crandol |first1=Mike |title=Understanding Evangelion |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2002-06-11 |website=Anime News Network |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> Pete Harcoff of Anime Critic described Asuka as providing much of the comic relief, while also being an \"annoying snot\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animecritic.com/evangelion/anr-evangelion.html|title=Neon Genesis Evangelion|author=Pete Harcoff|date=May 26, 2003|accessdate=June 29, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215400/http://www.animecritic.com/evangelion/anr-evangelion.html|archivedate=October 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[IGN]] ranked her as the 13th greatest anime character of all time, saying that \"On the surface, she's a simple character. ...
