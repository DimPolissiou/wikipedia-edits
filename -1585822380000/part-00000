It was established by the trapper [[Miles Goodyear]] in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today.\n\nIn November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000. The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}\n\nThe settlement was then called '''Brownsville''', after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[Peter Skene Ogden]], who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which \"Ogden\" was the first to set foot in the area. A [[Samuel Ogden]] traveled though the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park.\n\n[[File:Ogden-utah-depot-1910.jpg|thumb|390px|right|Westbound passengers changed cars at Ogden, from Union Pacific to Southern Pacific, which took them to California]]\n\nOgden is the closest sizable city to the [[Golden Spike]] location at [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit, Utah]], where the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was joined in 1869. It was known as a major passenger railroad junction owing to its location along major east\u2013west and north\u2013south routes, prompting the local chamber of commerce to adopt the motto, \"You can't get anywhere without coming to Ogden.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Ogden|url=http://www.ogdencity.com/en/about_ogden/history_demographics/ogden_history.aspx|work=Ogden City|publisher=City of Ogden, Utah|accessdate=12 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307014543/http://www.ogdencity.com/en/about_ogden/history_demographics/ogden_history.aspx|archivedate=March 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Railroad passengers traveling west to San Francisco from the eastern United States typically passed through Ogden (and not through the larger [[Salt Lake City]] to the south). However, [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, no longer serves Ogden. Passengers who want to travel to and from Ogden by rail must travel via ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] to Salt Lake City and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].\n\nIn 1972, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] completed construction of and dedicated the [[Ogden Utah Temple]] in Ogden. The [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] was built to serve the area's large [[Latter-day Saint|LDS]] population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle.

However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] had surpassed Ogden in population.\n\nThe [[Defense Depot Ogden Utah]] operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997.

[[Pineview Dam]] is in the [[Ogden Canyon|Ogden River Canyon]] {{convert|7|mi|km}} east of Ogden. The reservoir behind the dam provides over {{convert|110000|acre.ft|m3}} of water storage and water recreation for the area.\n\nProminent mountain peaks near Ogden include [[Mount Ogden]] to the east and [[Ben Lomond Mountain (Utah)|Ben Lomond]] to the north.\n\n===Streetscape===\n[[File:CtyMapWeber.png|thumb|right|Ogden and its surrounding area]]\nFrom south to west to north, Ogden's neighboring towns are South Ogden, Roy, West Haven, Marriott-Slaterville, Farr West, Pleasant View and North Ogden. The city is - like many others in the USA - characterized by a spacious, [[Grid_plan|street grid]] with many blocks. The streets are numbered from north to south, which is expressed in the corresponding street names. As in Salt Lake City, counting begins at the center of the LDS church. By extending the numbers with directions (\"E\" for east and \"W\" for west) their relative relation to the central point is made clear. In the center of the city, the blocks from Union Station along 25th Street, the west-to-east oriented cross streets are named after former U.S. presidents such as Lincoln Avenue, Grant Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Adam Avenue, Jefferson Avenue or Madison Avenue. The central connecting street in north-south orientation is Harrison-Boulevard. The city area is divided into six districts: in the North End, including West Ogden, Downtown and East Central, in the East, including East Bench and Shadow Valley.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Ogden experiences either a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') or a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') depending on which variant of the system is used. Summers are hot and relatively dry, with highs frequently reaching {{convert|95|F|C}}, with a few days per year reaching {{convert|100|F|C|0}}. Rain is provided in the form of infrequent thunderstorms during summer, usually between mid-July and mid-September during the height of monsoon season. The Pacific storm season usually lasts from about October through May, with precipitation reaching its peak in spring. Snow usually first occurs in late October or early November, with the last occurring sometime in April. Winters are cool and snowy, with highs averaging {{convert|37|F|C}} in January. Snowfall averages about {{convert|22|in|cm}}, with approximately {{convert|21.98|in|mm}} of precipitation annually.

It then continues north to [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]. [[Utah State Route 39|State Route 39]] runs east\u2013west through the city as 12th Street, and continues eastward through Ogden Canyon providing access to Pineview Reservoir and the mountain and ski resort town of [[Huntsville, Utah|Huntsville]].\n\nThe [[Utah Transit Authority]] (UTA) operates four bus routes directly between Salt Lake City and Ogden, as well as numerous others that serve [[Weber County, Utah|Weber]] and northern [[Davis County, Utah|Davis]] counties that connect into either the Ogden Intermodal Hub on the west edge of town or to [[Weber State University]]. Ogden is also the source of the two routes that serve [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]], the northernmost extension of UTA's bus system. It also has a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus stop along a line that runs north\u2013south along I-15. The ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[commuter rail]] runs between [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Pleasant View, Utah|Pleasant View]], just north of Ogden, and includes a stop at the Ogden Intermodal Hub. This line opened for service on April 26, 2008.\n\n[[Amtrak]] service is provided with a bus connection running to/from Salt Lake City, where there are daily [[California Zephyr]] trains west to the [[Oakland, California]] area and east to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Amtrak trains do not serve Ogden directly. Historically, [[Union Station (Ogden, Utah)|Ogden Union Station]] served as a hub for frequent trains going northwest to [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Seattle, Washington]], and east to Chicago. Amtrak ended the ''[[Pioneer (train)|Pioneer]]'' in 1997. In the same year Amtrak ended the [[Los Angeles]] to Chicago ''[[Desert Wind]].''\n\n[[Ogden-Hinckley Airport]], Utah's busiest municipal airport, is in the southwest portion of the city.

It was established by the trapper [[Miles Goodyear]] in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today.\n\nIn November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000. The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}\n\nThe settlement was then called '''Brownsville''', after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[Peter Skene Ogden]], who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which \"Ogden\" was the first to set foot in the area. A [[Samuel Ogden]] traveled though the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park.\n\n[[File:Ogden-utah-depot-1910.jpg|thumb|390px|right|Westbound passengers changed cars at Ogden, from Union Pacific to Southern Pacific, which took them to California]]\n\nOgden is the closest sizable city to the [[Golden Spike]] location at [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit, Utah]], where the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was joined in 1869.

The [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] was built to serve the area's large [[Latter-day Saint|LDS]] population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle.

However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] had surpassed Ogden in population.\n\nThe [[Defense Depot Ogden Utah]] operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some of its {{convert|1,128|acre}} have been converted into a commercial and industrial park called the [[Business Depot Ogden]].\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\nOgden is located at {{Coord|41.2196|-111.9712|type:city_region:US-UT|format=dms|display=inline}} (41.2196, &minus;111.9712),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the foot of the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch Mountains]]. This is at about the same latitude as [[Benevent]] in [[Campania]] in southern Italy. \n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 26.6&nbsp;square miles (69.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), all land.  Elevations in the city range from about {{convert|4300|to|5000|ft|m}} above sea level.\n[[File:2005-0623-VK-OgdenSign.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ogden\" sign over Washington Boulevard at the [[Ogden River]]; toward downtown]]\nThe [[Ogden River|Ogden]] and [[Weber River]]s, which originate in the mountains to the east, flow through the city and meet at a confluence just west of the city limits. [[Pineview Dam]] is in the [[Ogden Canyon|Ogden River Canyon]] {{convert|7|mi|km}} east of Ogden. The reservoir behind the dam provides over {{convert|110000|acre.ft|m3}} of water storage and water recreation for the area.\n\nProminent mountain peaks near Ogden include [[Mount Ogden]] to the east and [[Ben Lomond Mountain (Utah)|Ben Lomond]] to the north.\n\n===Streetscape===\n[[File:CtyMapWeber.png|thumb|right|Ogden and its surrounding area]]\nFrom south to west to north, Ogden's neighboring towns are South Ogden, Roy, West Haven, Marriott-Slaterville, Farr West, Pleasant View and North Ogden. The city is - like many others in the USA - characterized by a spacious, [[Grid_plan|street grid]] with many blocks. The streets are numbered from north to south, which is expressed in the corresponding street names. As in Salt Lake City, counting begins at the center of the LDS church. By extending the numbers with directions (\"E\" for east and \"W\" for west) their relative relation to the central point is made clear. In the center of the city, the blocks from Union Station along 25th Street, the west-to-east oriented cross streets are named after former U.S. presidents such as Lincoln Avenue, Grant Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Adam Avenue, Jefferson Avenue or Madison Avenue. The central connecting street in north-south orientation is Harrison-Boulevard. The city area is divided into six districts: in the North End, including West Ogden, Downtown and East Central, in the East, including East Bench and Shadow Valley.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Ogden experiences either a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') or a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') depending on which variant of the system is used. Summers are hot and relatively dry, with highs frequently reaching {{convert|95|F|C}}, with a few days per year reaching {{convert|100|F|C|0}}. Rain is provided in the form of infrequent thunderstorms during summer, usually between mid-July and mid-September during the height of monsoon season. The Pacific storm season usually lasts from about October through May, with precipitation reaching its peak in spring. Snow usually first occurs in late October or early November, with the last occurring sometime in April. Winters are cool and snowy, with highs averaging {{convert|37|F|C}} in January. Snowfall averages about {{convert|22|in|cm}}, with approximately {{convert|21.98|in|mm}} of precipitation annually.

Although GDP is total output, it is primarily useful because it closely approximates the total spending: the sum of consumer spending, investment made by industry, excess of exports over imports, and government spending.  Due to inflation, GDP increases and does not actually reflect the true growth in an economy.
