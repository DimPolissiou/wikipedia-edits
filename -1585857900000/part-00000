Sweden's 2002 anti-trafficking law prohibits trafficking for both [[sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] and [[forced labor]], which prescribes penalties of two to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, which are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes. Prosecutors continued, however, to rely on a [[prostitution]] procurement law with weaker penalties to prosecute and convict a number of sex traffickers. In 2007, police conducted 15 trafficking investigations, a decrease from 28 investigations in 2006. Authorities prosecuted and convicted two sex traffickers using the anti-trafficking law and 11 using the procurement statute, down from 21 prosecutions and convictions in 2006. One trafficker was sentenced to up to eight years\u2019 imprisonment, one trafficker was sentenced to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment, and 11 traffickers were sentenced to up to two years\u2019 imprisonment; no trafficking sentences were suspended.

Authorities did work with British and Irish counterparts, however, on several labor trafficking investigations over the reporting period.<ref name=dos/>\n\n==Protection==\nSweden continued to provide adequate victim assistance both domestically and in source countries during the reporting period. The government continued to fund [[NGO]]s in Sweden and abroad to provide victim rehabilitation, health care, vocational training, and legal assistance. Swedish authorities encourage victims to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; identified foreign victims are granted a minimum 30-day temporary residency permit that provides victims with access to health care and social services.\n\nOver the reporting period, 11 female victims stayed in state-funded shelters and 10 received temporary residency permits. Victims who decline to participate in investigations are subject to deportation. The Swedish government does not offer legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. In 2007, authorities deported one victim to Nigeria. There are no government programs for assistance to repatriated victims; however, some state-funded NGOs have programs to ensure victims from specific source countries are provided with safe repatriation. The government ensures that victims are not penalized for unlawful acts committed as a result of their being trafficked.<ref name=dos/>\n\n==Prevention==\nThe Government of Sweden continued its trafficking prevention efforts. In 2007, the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) continued funding awareness-building projects in the former [[Yugoslavia]], Romania, Albania, and Bulgaria. SIDA also contributed $42,000 to a [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) project based in [[Brazil]] to counter trafficking and migrant smuggling. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs eliminated the position of Swedish Ambassador for International Cooperation against Trafficking in Human Beings. Sweden adequately monitored immigration patterns for evidence of trafficking and continued its annual report, assessing trafficking trends and government efforts.

He attended Catholic elementary school and [[Brebeuf College School]], a Jesuit high school in [[North York]]. At [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], [[University of Toronto]], Foran studied English literature and history. After two years in [[Dublin]], where he completed a Master's in Irish Literature at [[University College, Dublin]], he and his wife lived for a period outside New York City. In 1988 they relocated to Beijing, China, where Foran taught at a university and witnessed the 1989 democracy movement.\n\n''Coming Attractions'', an annual book highlighting new writers, published several of his early stories in 1987. In 1992 his short-story \"Boy Under Water\" was included in ''Best Canadian Stories''.\n\n''Sketches in Winter'', published by HarperCollins Canada in 1992, chronicled the aftermath of the June 4 massacre in Beijing from the perspective of a group of Beijing intellectuals.\n\nIn 1994 Foran published his first novel, ''Kitchen Music'', set in Ireland, Canada and Vietnam. It was short-listed for the [[Books in Canada First Novel Award|W.H. Smith/Books in Canada First Novel Award]]. Then living in [[Montreal]], Foran served as contributing editor to ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'', writing regularly on Quebec, and as books columnist for the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''.\n\n''The Last House of Ulster'' appeared in 1995, the year Foran relocated with his family to [[Peterborough, Ontario]]. It told the story of the Irish Troubles from the point of view of a North Belfast family. Shortlisted for the [[Governor General's Award]], the book won the [[QSPELL Award]] for best work of non-fiction by a Quebec writer. He was awarded the QSPELL again in 1997 for his second novel, ''Butterfly Lovers'', a story set in Montreal and Beijing. He and his family spent 1997\u20131998 in Hong Kong. A French translation of ''Butterfly Lovers'' appeared in 1999 under the title ''Amants''.\n\n''The Story of My Life (so far)'', a book about childhood, was published by HarperCollins in 1998. The novel ''House on Fire'' followed in 2001. It takes place in a country modeled on Tibet, and in Hong Kong. In 2000 Foran also contributed a chapter on Canada to ''The Rough Guide to World Music''. He returned to China with his family in 2001, living there for two more years. As well as making documentaries for the [[CBC Radio]] program ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' on subjects ranging from Asian martial arts cinema to Indian writing, he served on the organizing committee for the Man Hong Kong International Literary Festival. In 2005 Foran published the novel ''Carolan's Farewell'', set in 18th century Ireland. That same year HarperCollins issued a 10th anniversary edition of ''The Last House of Ulster'', with a new preface by the author.\n\nIn spring 2008 a collection of his travel and literary essays, ''Join the Revolution, Comrade'', was published by Biblioasis. His sports, travel and literary journalism has been published in magazines and newspapers in Canada, the US, and the UK.\n\nIn 2006 Foran signed with [[Alfred A. Knopf Canada]] to write a biography of [[Mordecai Richler]]. The book, while not authorized, was written with the cooperation of the Richler family. ''[[Mordecai: The Life & Times]]'' was released in October 2010, and was named to many best-of-year lists. Mordecai Richler: The Last of the Wild Jews, a documentary film co-written by Foran and director Francine Pelletier, first aired on BRAVO TV in December 2010. In September 2011 the film was awarded a Gemini for best biography documentary.\n \nIn early 2011 ''[[Mordecai: The Life & Times]]'' was short-listed for both the [[BC Foundation Non-Fiction Prize]], and the [[Charles Taylor Prize]]. It was awarded the Taylor Prize in Toronto in February 2011, and won the 2011 [[Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction]] in October and the Governor General's Literary Award for Non-Fiction in November. The biography was also given a Canadian Jewish Book Prize. On November 15, 2011 the Globe and Mail declared ''Mordecai: The Life and Times'' \"probably the single most awarded book of any genre in the history of Canadian literature.\"\n\nIn March 2011 Foran's short interpretive biography ''Maurice Richard'' was published by Penguin, as part of their Extraordinary Canadians series. In 2017, a documentary based on the book aired on CBC television.\n\n''Planet Lolita'', his fifth novel, appeared in June 2014 with HarperCollins. The novel returns to contemporary Asia, the setting of two earlier works of fiction, to explore the disquiet of our digital age as seen through the eyes of a teenage girl. Since 2015, Foran has published exclusively journalism and essays, most notably on post-nationalism in The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/04/the-canada-experiment-is-this-the-worlds-first-postnational-country) and on a writer in mid-career (http://notesandqueries.ca/essays/view-shore-writer-mid-career-takes-stock-charles-foran/).\n\nBetween 2013-2014 Foran taught courses in Irish literature at St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. From Jan 2015 to Jan 2019 he served as CEO the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, an organization committed to welcoming new Canadians through culture and advancing conversations about citizenship.\n\nForan was named to the Order of Canada in 2014. A former president of [[PEN Canada]] from 2011 until September 2013, he is a senior fellow at [[Massey College]] and an adjunct professor in the Department of English at the University of Toronto. In fall 2018 he was awarded the Writers' Trust Fellowship.

He attended Catholic elementary school and [[Brebeuf College School]], a Jesuit high school in [[North York]]. At [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], [[University of Toronto]], Foran studied English literature and history. After two years in [[Dublin]], where he completed a Master's in Irish Literature at [[University College, Dublin]], he and his wife lived for a period outside New York City. In 1988 they relocated to Beijing, China, where Foran taught at a university and witnessed the 1989 democracy movement.\n\n''Coming Attractions'', an annual book highlighting new writers, published several of his early stories in 1987. In 1992 his short-story \"Boy Under Water\" was included in ''Best Canadian Stories''.\n\n''Sketches in Winter'', published by HarperCollins Canada in 1992, chronicled the aftermath of the June 4 massacre in Beijing from the perspective of a group of Beijing intellectuals.\n\nIn 1994 Foran published his first novel, ''Kitchen Music'', set in Ireland, Canada and Vietnam. It was short-listed for the [[Books in Canada First Novel Award|W.H. Smith/Books in Canada First Novel Award]]. Then living in [[Montreal]], Foran served as contributing editor to ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)|Saturday Night]]'', writing regularly on Quebec, and as books columnist for the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''.\n\n''The Last House of Ulster'' appeared in 1995, the year Foran relocated with his family to [[Peterborough, Ontario]]. It told the story of the Irish Troubles from the point of view of a North Belfast family. Shortlisted for the [[Governor General's Award]], the book won the [[QSPELL Award]] for best work of non-fiction by a Quebec writer. He was awarded the QSPELL again in 1997 for his second novel, ''Butterfly Lovers'', a story set in Montreal and Beijing. He and his family spent 1997\u20131998 in Hong Kong. A French translation of ''Butterfly Lovers'' appeared in 1999 under the title ''Amants''.\n\n''The Story of My Life (so far)'', a book about childhood, was published by HarperCollins in 1998. The novel ''House on Fire'' followed in 2001. It takes place in a country modeled on Tibet, and in Hong Kong. In 2000 Foran also contributed a chapter on Canada to ''The Rough Guide to World Music''. He returned to China with his family in 2001, living there for two more years. As well as making documentaries for the [[CBC Radio]] program ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' on subjects ranging from Asian martial arts cinema to Indian writing, he served on the organizing committee for the Man Hong Kong International Literary Festival. In 2005 Foran published the novel ''Carolan's Farewell'', set in 18th century Ireland. That same year HarperCollins issued a 10th anniversary edition of ''The Last House of Ulster'', with a new preface by the author.\n\nIn spring 2008 a collection of his travel and literary essays, ''Join the Revolution, Comrade'', was published by Biblioasis. His sports, travel and literary journalism has been published in magazines and newspapers in Canada, the US, and the UK.\n\nIn 2006 Foran signed with [[Alfred A. Knopf Canada]] to write a biography of [[Mordecai Richler]]. The book, while not authorized, was written with the cooperation of the Richler family. ''[[Mordecai: The Life & Times]]'' was released in October 2010, and was named to many best-of-year lists.

La Rambla forms the boundary between the quarters of ''[[Barri G\u00f2tic]]'', to the east, and ''[[El Raval]]'', to the west.<ref name=avoc>{{cite web | url = http://www.aviewoncities.com/barcelona/rambla.htm | title = La Rambla, Barcelona | work = a view on cities | publisher = van ermengem bvba | accessdate = 2013-12-01}}</ref><ref name=btg>{{cite web | url = http://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/ramblas/barcelona-las-ramblas.html | title = Guide to Barcelona Las Ramblas | work = www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com | accessdate = 2013-12-02}}</ref>\n\nLa Rambla can be crowded, especially during the height of the tourist season. Its popularity with tourists has affected the character of the street, with a move to pavement cafes and souvenir kiosks. It has also suffered from the attention of [[pickpocket]]s.<ref name=btg/>\n\nThe Spanish poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] once said that La Rambla was \"the only street in the world which I wish would never end.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnc.cat/en/lecture-lorca-i-catalunya/ | title = Lorca i Catalunya | publisher = Teatre Nacional de Catalunya | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}</ref>\n\n== Orientation ==\n[[File:Spain.Barcelona.Les.Rambles.svg|thumb|Map of La Rambla]]\nLa Rambla can be considered a series of shorter streets, each differently named, hence the plural form ''Les Rambles'' (the original Catalan form; in Spanish it is ''Las Ramblas''). The street is successively called:<ref name=avoc/><ref name=btg/>\n* ''Rambla de Canaletes'' - the site of the [[Font de Canaletes]] fountain\n* ''Rambla dels Estudis'' - the site of the former Jesuit University, whose only remainder is the Church of Bethlehem\n* ''Rambla de Sant Josep'' (or ''de les Flors'') - the site of an open-air flower market\n* ''Rambla dels Caputxins'' - the site of a former [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery, now dominated by the Liceu opera-house\n* ''Rambla de Santa M\u00f2nica'' - named after the convent of [[St. Monica]], now an arts centre.\n\nTo the north of La Rambla lies [[Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, Barcelona|Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya]], a large square in central Barcelona that is generally considered to be both its city centre and the place where the old city and the 19th century-built Eixample meet.<ref name=avoc/>\n\nTo the east of La Rambla is the ''[[Barri G\u00f2tic]]'' or Gothic Quarter, the centre of the old city of Barcelona. The ''Barri G\u00f2tic'' retains a labyrinthine street plan, with small squares and streets, many of which connect onto the Rambla. One of the larger of these squares is the ''[[Pla\u00e7a Reial]]'', a lively 19th century square with tall palm trees and street lamps designed by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], which opens down a short entrance passage off the ''Rambla dels Caputxins''. Further into the ''Barri G\u00f2tic'' can be found the [[Cathedral of Santa Eul\u00e0lia]] and the ''[[Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume]]'' that houses the buildings of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] and Barcelona's City Council.<ref name=avoc/>\n\nTo the west of La Rambla is the rather different ''[[El Raval]]'' quarter. Outside the city's earliest walls, this area was originally the site of various religious and medical institutions. Later factories grew up along with housing for the workers, whilst the proximity to the port led to the area becoming known for its nightlife and clubs, as well as prostitution and crime. Today the area still retains a degree of 'edge', but it also home to several important buildings, including Gaud\u00ed's ''[[Palau G\u00fcell]]'', which is only a few steps down the ''[[Carrer Nou de la Rambla]]'' from the ''Rambla dels Caputxins''.<ref name=avoc/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.totraval.org/historia | title = Hist\u00f2ria - Raval | language = Catalan | publisher = Fundaci\u00f3 Tot Raval | accessdate = 2013-12-02 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002140/http://www.totraval.org/historia | archivedate = 2013-12-03 }}</ref>\n\nAt the southern end of the Rambla is the [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|Christopher Columbus Monument]] and the [[Port Vell]], the old port of Barcelona, now largely given over to pleasure craft. Near to the port end of the Rambla are the [[Barcelona Royal Dockyard|Royal Dockyards]] (in Catalan, ''Drassanes''), which house a maritime museum specifically devoted to naval history in the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name=avoc/>\n\nExtensions at either end of the Rambla also carry the name Rambla, but are not normally considered part of La Rambla itself. To the north, the [[Rambla de Catalunya, Barcelona|Rambla de Catalunya]] extends into the [[Eixample]] district. To the south, construction of the ''[[Marem\u00e0gnum]]'' in the early 1990s resulted in a continuation of La Rambla on a wooden walkway into the harbour called the ''[[Rambla de Mar]]''.<ref name=avoc/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Map-Barcelona-c.1700.png|thumb|Barcelona around 1700, showing La Rambla running down the centre flanked by the old city wall on its right.]]\nThe course of La Rambla was originally a sewage-filled stream,<ref name=\"Eaude2011\">{{cite book|author=Michael Eaude|title=Catalonia - A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7u_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT198|date=12 October 2011|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-908493-25-5|page=198|quote=From the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, the Ramblas follows a slightly zigzag line, the contour of the sewage-filled medieval stream it was, down to the Columbus column and the sea.}}</ref> usually dry but an important drain for the heavy rainwater flowing from the [[Collserola]] hills during spring and autumn.

In 1440, the stream was diverted to run outside the new walls, and La Rambla gradually started turning into a street.<ref name=cronologia>{{cite web|url=http://www.amicsdelarambla.cat/cat_historia_cronologia.html|title=Hist\u00f2ria de la Rambla: Cronologia|publisher=Amics de la Rambla|language=Catalan|accessdate=2013-04-28}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few centuries, La Rambla became established as a centre of Barcelona city life, a long wide thoroughfare used for festivals, markets, and sports. Several large religious establishments were also built along the street during this period. These include the Jesuit Bethlehem monastery and college (1553), of which just the later church remains; the Carmelite St. Joseph's monastery, on the site of the current [[La Boqueria|Boqueria market]]; and a Capuchin monastery at the lower end of the street.<ref name=cronologia />\n\n[[File:Barcelona 1905.jpg|thumb|left|La Rambla in 1905]]\nIn 1703, the first of the trees lining La Rambla were planted.<ref name=cronologia /> They were 280 birch trees and later on those were replaced by elm trees.

Its popularity with tourists has affected the character of the street, with a move to pavement cafes and souvenir kiosks. It has also suffered from the attention of [[pickpocket]]s.<ref name=btg/>\n\nThe Spanish poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] once said that La Rambla was \"the only street in the world which I wish would never end.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnc.cat/en/lecture-lorca-i-catalunya/ | title = Lorca i Catalunya | publisher = Teatre Nacional de Catalunya | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}</ref>\n\n== Orientation ==\n[[File:Spain.Barcelona.Les.Rambles.svg|thumb|Map of La Rambla]]\nLa Rambla can be considered a series of shorter streets, each differently named, hence the plural form ''Les Rambles'' (the original Catalan form; in Spanish it is ''Las Ramblas''). The street is successively called:<ref name=avoc/><ref name=btg/>\n* ''Rambla de Canaletes'' - the site of the [[Font de Canaletes]] fountain\n* ''Rambla dels Estudis'' - the site of the former Jesuit University, whose only remainder is the Church of Bethlehem\n* ''Rambla de Sant Josep'' (or ''de les Flors'') - the site of an open-air flower market\n* ''Rambla dels Caputxins'' - the site of a former [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery, now dominated by the Liceu opera-house\n* ''Rambla de Santa M\u00f2nica'' - named after the convent of [[St. Monica]], now an arts centre.\n\nTo the north of La Rambla lies [[Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, Barcelona|Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya]], a large square in central Barcelona that is generally considered to be both its city centre and the place where the old city and the 19th century-built Eixample meet.<ref name=avoc/>\n\nTo the east of La Rambla is the ''[[Barri G\u00f2tic]]'' or Gothic Quarter, the centre of the old city of Barcelona. The ''Barri G\u00f2tic'' retains a labyrinthine street plan, with small squares and streets, many of which connect onto the Rambla. One of the larger of these squares is the ''[[Pla\u00e7a Reial]]'', a lively 19th century square with tall palm trees and street lamps designed by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], which opens down a short entrance passage off the ''Rambla dels Caputxins''. Further into the ''Barri G\u00f2tic'' can be found the [[Cathedral of Santa Eul\u00e0lia]] and the ''[[Pla\u00e7a Sant Jaume]]'' that houses the buildings of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] and Barcelona's City Council.<ref name=avoc/>\n\nTo the west of La Rambla is the rather different ''[[El Raval]]'' quarter. Outside the city's earliest walls, this area was originally the site of various religious and medical institutions. Later factories grew up along with housing for the workers, whilst the proximity to the port led to the area becoming known for its nightlife and clubs, as well as prostitution and crime. Today the area still retains a degree of 'edge', but it also home to several important buildings, including Gaud\u00ed's ''[[Palau G\u00fcell]]'', which is only a few steps down the ''[[Carrer Nou de la Rambla]]'' from the ''Rambla dels Caputxins''.<ref name=avoc/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.totraval.org/historia | title = Hist\u00f2ria - Raval | language = Catalan | publisher = Fundaci\u00f3 Tot Raval | accessdate = 2013-12-02 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002140/http://www.totraval.org/historia | archivedate = 2013-12-03 }}</ref>\n\nAt the southern end of the Rambla is the [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|Christopher Columbus Monument]] and the [[Port Vell]], the old port of Barcelona, now largely given over to pleasure craft. Near to the port end of the Rambla are the [[Barcelona Royal Dockyard|Royal Dockyards]] (in Catalan, ''Drassanes''), which house a maritime museum specifically devoted to naval history in the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name=avoc/>\n\nExtensions at either end of the Rambla also carry the name Rambla, but are not normally considered part of La Rambla itself. To the north, the [[Rambla de Catalunya, Barcelona|Rambla de Catalunya]] extends into the [[Eixample]] district. To the south, construction of the ''[[Marem\u00e0gnum]]'' in the early 1990s resulted in a continuation of La Rambla on a wooden walkway into the harbour called the ''[[Rambla de Mar]]''.<ref name=avoc/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Map-Barcelona-c.1700.png|thumb|Barcelona around 1700, showing La Rambla running down the centre flanked by the old city wall on its right.]]\nThe course of La Rambla was originally a sewage-filled stream,<ref name=\"Eaude2011\">{{cite book|author=Michael Eaude|title=Catalonia - A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7u_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT198|date=12 October 2011|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=978-1-908493-25-5|page=198|quote=From the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, the Ramblas follows a slightly zigzag line, the contour of the sewage-filled medieval stream it was, down to the Columbus column and the sea.}}</ref> usually dry but an important drain for the heavy rainwater flowing from the [[Collserola]] hills during spring and autumn.

Several large religious establishments were also built along the street during this period. These include the Jesuit Bethlehem monastery and college (1553), of which just the later church remains; the Carmelite St. Joseph's monastery, on the site of the current [[La Boqueria|Boqueria market]]; and a Capuchin monastery at the lower end of the street.<ref name=cronologia />\n\n[[File:Barcelona 1905.jpg|thumb|left|La Rambla in 1905]]\nIn 1703, the first of the trees lining La Rambla were planted.<ref name=cronologia /> They were 280 birch trees and later on those were replaced by elm trees.

In the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1843\u20131868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the ''Disposiciones de Zaragoza'' (1845) and  the ''Reglamento para la represi\u00f3n de los excesos de la prostituci\u00f3n en Madrid'' (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. \n(Guerena 2003, 2008)\n  \nIn 1935 during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] (1931\u20136) prostitution was prohibited. Once the [[Francoist Spain|Dictatorship]] (1939\u201375) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially ''abolitionist'' on 18 June 1962, when the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (''C\u00f3digo Penal'') according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention,  regarded sex workers (''trabajadores sexuales'') as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.<ref>Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001).

In practice however, prostitution was quietly ignored and tolerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-the-world-capital-of-prostitution-2151581.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Alasdair | last=Fotheringham | title=Spain, the world capital of prostitution? | date=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[History of Spain (1975\u2013present)|democracy was restored in 1975]], it was not till the Penal Code revisions of 1995<ref>Peter Pierson.

In the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] (1843\u20131868) regulation was introduced, firstly in cities, the ''Disposiciones de Zaragoza'' (1845) and  the ''Reglamento para la represi\u00f3n de los excesos de la prostituci\u00f3n en Madrid'' (1847), followed by the 1848 Penal Code. \n(Guerena 2003, 2008)\n  \nIn 1935 during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] (1931\u20136) prostitution was prohibited. Once the [[Francoist Spain|Dictatorship]] (1939\u201375) was established, this law was repealed (1941). Spain became officially ''abolitionist'' on 18 June 1962, when the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|1949 United Nations (UN) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] was ratified by Spain, and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code (''C\u00f3digo Penal'') according to the Convention. In theory, this policy, in accordance with the Convention,  regarded sex workers (''trabajadores sexuales'') as victims of sexual exploitation and advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves, and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work.<ref>Carracedo Bullido, Rosario (2001).

Sex traffickers exploit [[Venezuela]]n women fleeing the collapsing social and economic conditions at home. \n\nSpanish law does not permit nor prohibit prostitution, and NGOs believe a large percentage of individuals in prostitution in Spain are trafficking victims.
