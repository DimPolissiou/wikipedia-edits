The series takes place in a fictional universe where vast numbers of pirates, soldiers, revolutionaries, and other adventurers fight each other, using various [[superhuman]] and [[supernatural]] abilities. The majority of the characters are human, but the cast also includes [[giant]]s, [[Merman|mermen]] and [[mermaid]]s, [[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|fish-men]]{{efn|Fish-men are humanoids in ''One Piece'' whose upper body resembles that of sea creatures. They are contrasted with [[Merman|mermen]] who have the upper half of a human and the bottom half of a fish.{{gnr|vol|23|:SBS}}}}, sky people, and minks, among others. Many of the characters possess supernatural abilities gained by eating so-called \"Devil Fruits\". The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of pirates as they search for the \"One Piece\" treasure. \n\n[[#Luffy|Monkey D. Luffy]] is the series' main protagonist, a young pirate who wishes to succeed [[#Roger|Gol D. Roger]], the deceased King of the Pirates, by finding his treasure, the \"One Piece\". Throughout the series, Luffy gathers himself a diverse crew, named the [[#Straw Hat Pirates|Straw Hat Pirates]], including: the three-sword-wielding [[#Roronoa Zoro|Roronoa Zoro]]; the thief and navigator [[#Nami|Nami]]; the cowardly marksman and inventor [[#Usopp|Usopp]]; the cook and martial artist [[#Sanji|Vinsmoke Sanji]]; the anthropomorphic reindeer and doctor [[#Chopper|Tony Tony Chopper]]; the archaeologist [[#Robin|Nico Robin]]; the cyborg shipwright [[#Franky|Franky]]; the living skeleton musician [[#Brook|Brook]]; and the fish-man helmsman [[#Jimbei|Jimbei]]. Together they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams, encountering other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt [[#World Government|World Government]], and various other friends and foes.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and conception==\nSeveral characters have been stated to be based on actual people such as: [[#Eustass Kid|Eustass Kid]] ([[Eustace the Monk]] and [[William Kidd]]), [[#X.

Norio had asked Oda to draw more ''[[Homosexuality in Japan|okama]]'' (homosexual) characters and became Ivankov's first voice actor.{{gnr|ch|570}}\n\nOda had created [[#Helmeppo|Helmeppo]] before he created Captain Morgan, Helmeppo's father. Oda originally named Morgan after \"Chop\", with the character's full title being \"Naval Captain Chop\" or \"Sailor Chop\". \"Sailor\" in Japanese is {{nihongo||\u6c34\u5175|suihei}}, and \"Suihei Chop\" is a fighting technique used by [[Giant Baba]], a Japanese wrestler. He created several versions of Morgan before settling on the final design. After an editor told him that Morgan, in Oda's words, \"looked lame\", he changed the design to its final style.{{gnr|vol|1|:p. 144 (en)}}\n\n==Straw Hat Pirates==\n[[File:Strawhat crew jolly roger.svg|thumb|Jolly roger of the Straw Hat Pirates]]\nThe protagonists <!-- There is more than one protagonist in the series, so please don't change to main characters without first discussing it on the talk page. --> of the ''One Piece'' series are all the members of the {{nihongo|Straw Hat Pirates|\u9ea6\u308f\u3089\u306e\u4e00\u5473|Mugiwara no Ichimi}}, a crew of ten pirates captained by Monkey D. Luffy. The crew's number increases throughout the series, as Luffy recruits new members. Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the ''Going Merry'', which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the ''Thousand Sunny'' created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them.\n\n===<span id=\"Luffy\"></span>Monkey D.

The series takes place in a fictional universe where vast numbers of pirates, soldiers, revolutionaries, and other adventurers fight each other, using various [[superhuman]] and [[supernatural]] abilities. The majority of the characters are human, but the cast also includes [[giant]]s, [[Merman|mermen]] and [[mermaid]]s, [[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|Fishmen]]{{efn|Fishmen are humanoids in ''One Piece'' whose upper body resembles that of sea creatures.

Many of the characters possess supernatural abilities gained by eating so-called \"Devil Fruits\". The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of pirates as they search for the \"One Piece\" treasure. \n\n[[#Luffy|Monkey D. Luffy]] is the series' main protagonist, a young pirate who wishes to succeed [[#Roger|Gol D. Roger]], the deceased King of the Pirates, by finding his treasure, the \"One Piece\".

He created several versions of Morgan before settling on the final design. After an editor told him that Morgan, in Oda's words, \"looked lame\", he changed the design to its final style.{{gnr|vol|1|:p. 144 (en)}}\n\n==Straw Hat Pirates==\n[[File:Strawhat crew jolly roger.svg|thumb|Jolly roger of the Straw Hat Pirates]]\nThe protagonists <!-- There is more than one protagonist in the series, so please don't change to main characters without first discussing it on the talk page. --> of the ''One Piece'' series are all the members of the {{nihongo|Straw Hat Pirates|\u9ea6\u308f\u3089\u306e\u4e00\u5473|Mugiwara no Ichimi}}, a crew of ten pirates captained by Monkey D.

Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the ''Going Merry'', which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the ''Thousand Sunny'' created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them.\n\n===<span id=\"Luffy\"></span>Monkey D.

He also states that \"Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right, really coming to life only during the action scenes during which she does a fine job of being darned cool.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece-the-desert-princess-and-the-pirates-movie-no-8/dvd|first=Carl|last=Kimlinger|date=February 18, 2008|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|title=One Piece: The Desert Princess and the Pirates (Movie No. 8)|accessdate=March 31, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329022330/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece-the-desert-princess-and-the-pirates-movie-no-8/dvd|archive-date=March 29, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDustin Somner of ''Blu-ray.com'' comments that the Japanese and Funimation voice-acting is \"fairly good, but not exceptional\" and sometimes \"overly zany\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=1281&show=review|title=One Piece Movie 8 Blu-ray Review|first=Dustin|last=Somner|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2009|publisher=Blu-ray.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418163301/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=1281&show=review|archive-date=April 18, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk notes \"the daunting cast of characters, both good and bad\" as \"one of the appealing factors\" of the anime, but also comments that \"Some of the voices [of the 4Kids dub] were pretty irritating ... with a lot of high-pitches and over exaggerated speech.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/21195/one-piece-vol-2|title=One Piece Vol 2|last=Douglass|first=Todd, Jr.|date=April 16, 2006|accessdate=April 26, 2009|publisher=[[DVD talk]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504034515/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/21195/one-piece-vol-2/|archive-date=May 4, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Brigitte Sch\u00f6nhense of Splashcomics comments that the \"brilliant\" ({{lang-de|\"genial\"}}) flashbacks into the characters' pasts make them so \"likeable and lovable\" (German: ''\"sympathisch und liebenswert\"'') and that they are the manga's real strength.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splashcomics.de/php/rezensionen/rezension/69|first=Brigitte|last=Sch\u00f6nhense|language=German|publisher=Splashpages|title=Comic-Besprechung&nbsp;\u2013 One Piece 16|date=January 16, 2003|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.splashcomics.de/php/rezensionen/rezension/70|first=Brigitte|last=Sch\u00f6nhense|language=German|publisher=Splashpages|title=Comic-Besprechung&nbsp;\u2013 One Piece 17|date=March 13, 2003|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that Oda's characters are \"whacky\" and that his \"bizarre\" character designs create \"wonderful characterizations and personalities\".

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014, which began after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]] which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered to represent Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|basic law]], in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored 6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02 points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong had rank 75 while mainland China had rank 153.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=The Standard|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]]<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> as fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identify themselves as Chinese \u2013 pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as \"Chinese\".<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, and along with it the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media has noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nThe unaffordability of housing prices was also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> This is because, unlike the comparable [[city-state]] of Singapore, Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is due to the fact that since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have largely been ruled by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has also meant a few powerful families having significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /> Furthermore, a significant amount of the local government's revenue is made from land sales to developers.<ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nInitially, protesters solely demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12 June, the objective of the protesters has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced indefinite suspension of the bill on 15 June, reading on it may be quickly resumed. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. The bill was formally withdrawn on 23 October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12 June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12 June protest. Through the government's characterization of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12 June, specifically those against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15 March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31 March 2019 and another on 28 April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume the second reading of the bill in full council on 12 June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise the bill.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nIn the backdrop of the second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9 June. While Police estimated an attendance of the march on [[Hong Kong Island]] at 270,000, the organisers claimed that 1.03&nbsp;million people attended the rally.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/> [[Carrie Lam]] insisted the second reading debate on the bill be resumed on 12 June.<ref name=\"govhk_20190609_response\" /> Protesters [[612 Incident|successfully stopped the LegCo from resuming the second reading of the bill]] by surrounding the LegCo Complex. Riot police dispersed protesters using controversial methods such as kettling, firing tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets, allegedly assaulting journalists in the process.<ref name=\"scmp_3014104\" /> Police Commissioner [[Stephen Lo]] declared the clashes a \"riot\",<ref name=\"govhk_20190612_policeaction\" /> although the police itself were subsequently criticised for using excessive force, such as firing tear gas at a crowd who were peacefully protesting near [[CITIC Tower]],<ref name=\"independent_8957471\" /><ref name=\"amnesty_20190621_policereport\" /> and for the lack of identifying numbers on police officers.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190621_policeviolence\" /> Following the clashes, protesters began calling for an independent inquiry into police brutality; they also urged the government to retract the \"riot\" characterisation.\n\n[[File:190616 HK Protest Incendo 03.jpg|thumb|right|Organisers claimed 2 million attended the CHRF march on 16 June 2019, while the police put the figure at 338,000.]]\nOn 15 June, [[Carrie Lam]] announced the suspension of the bill but did not fully withdraw the bill.<ref name=\"scmp_3014643\" /> A 35-year-old man committed suicide in protest at Lam's decision.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190615_manjump\" /> CHRF claimed a record-breaking \"almost 2 million plus 1 citizens\" had participated in the 16 June protest, while the police estimated that there were 338,000 demonstrators at its peak.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" />\n\nProtesters surrounded the [[Hong Kong Police Headquarters|Police headquarters]] on 21 and 24 June for several hours and dispersed peacefully at night; on 24 June, they also blockaded other government buildings.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190621_protestsathqs\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3015817\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190626_urgeg20\" /> Protesters also began to call for international support and visited the consulates of member states of the [[G20]] expected at the [[2019 G20 Osaka summit|2019 Osaka summit]] on 28 and 29 June.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190626_urgeg20\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3016149\" />\n\n===Storming of Legco and spillovers===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (July 2019)}}\n[[File:\u793a\u5a01\u8005\u65bc\u7acb\u6cd5\u6703\u6703\u8b70\u5ef3\u5c55\u793a\u6a19\u8a9e, Jul 2019.jpg|left|thumb|Protesters briefly occupied the [[Legislative Council Complex]] on 1 July.]]\n\nThe CHRF claimed a record turnout of 550,000 for their [[Hong Kong 1 July marches|annual march on 1 July]], while police estimated around 190,000 at the peak;<ref name=\"appledaily_59774211\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_55000attend\" /> an independent polling organisation estimated attendance at 260,000.<ref name=\"reuters_20190705_countingmarchers\"/> The protest was largely peaceful.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests. Carrie Lam's perceived arrogance,<ref name=\"standardhk_129761\"/> her extended absence, reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters, and subpar performance at press conferences,<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> were believed to have enabled the protests to escalate.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters

name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> Frontline officers and protesters have insulted each other with degradative terms.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190826\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3025159\"/> Police officers also reported being \"physically and mentally\" tired, as they faced the risks of being [[doxed]], [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and distanced by their family members.<ref name=\"cnn_20190815_policeside\"/> The police's relations with journalists,<ref name=\"scmp_3017673\"/> social workers,<ref

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\".

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign.

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

extradition bill|the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]].<ref name=\"bbc_49317695\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190213_trojanhorse\" /> Had it been enacted, the bill would have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system of Mainland China]], thereby undermining [[One country, two systems|the region's autonomy]] and people's civil liberties,<ref name=\"reuters_20190524_eudiplomaticnote\" /><ref name=\"eji_20190523\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police, who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12 June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1 July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> The police's inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21 July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31 August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1 October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4 September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4 October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014, which began after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]] which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered to represent Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's [[Hong Kong Basic Law|basic law]], in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored 6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02 points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, and along with it the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media has noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nThe unaffordability of housing prices was also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> This is because, unlike the comparable [[city-state]] of Singapore, Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is due to the fact that since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have largely been ruled by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has also meant a few powerful families having significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /> Furthermore, a significant amount of the local government's revenue is made from land sales to developers.<ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\nInitially, protesters solely demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12 June, the objective of the protesters has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced indefinite suspension of the bill on 15 June, reading on it may be quickly resumed. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. The bill was formally withdrawn on 23 October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12 June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12 June protest. Through the government's characterization of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12 June, specifically those against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]]''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15 March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31 March 2019 and another on 28 April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests. Carrie Lam's perceived arrogance,<ref name=\"standardhk_129761\"/> her extended absence, reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters, and subpar performance at press conferences,<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> were believed to have enabled the protests to escalate.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters

name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> Frontline officers and protesters have insulted each other with degradative terms.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190826\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3025159\"/> Police officers also reported being \"physically and mentally\" tired, as they faced the risks of being [[doxed]], [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]], and distanced by their family members.<ref name=\"cnn_20190815_policeside\"/> The police's relations with journalists,<ref name=\"scmp_3017673\"/> social workers,<ref

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\".

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign.

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, [[Alan Garc\u00eda]], won 24.3% of the vote and went on to win the second round on 4 June 2006 with 52.6%.\n\n==History==\nAPRA was founded by [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre]] in [[Mexico City]] on 7 May 1924 with aspirations to becoming a continent-wide party, and it subsequently influenced a number of other [[Latin America]]n political movements, including [[Bolivia]]'s [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (''Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario'', MNR) and [[Costa Rica]]'s [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] (''Partido Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'', PLN).\n\nIt is the oldest surviving political party in Peru and one of the best established.  APRA is as much a social phenomenon as a political movement, with a membership whose loyalty to the party has been unwavering for several generations.\n\nAPRA initially espoused anti-imperialism, Pan-Americanism, international solidarity and economic nationalism. Years of repression and clandestinity, as well as Haya de la Torre's single-handed dominance of the party, resulted in striking sectarian and hierarchical traits.<ref>Roett, Riordan. \"Peru: The Message from Garcia.\" Foreign Affairs 64.2 (1985-1986): 274-286.</ref> The party's structure and the party's hold over its rank and file proved more lasting than its original program.\n\n===Political activity since 1980===\nAfter several years of military rule, APRA was allowed to participate as a legal political party in 1979. The party gathered strong support from the electorate, managing to win a majority of seats in the newly created Constituent Assembly, and supervised the first democratic elections in 12 years.\n\nHaya de la Torre was elected president of the Constituent Assembly and was slated to run as the party's presidential candidate in 1980. However, he died before the election. The party was divided between [[Armando Villanueva]] and Andres Townsend, each one of them claiming to be the political and ideological heirs of Haya de la Torre. APRA chose Villanueva as its candidate, while Townsend and other members left the party to create the Movimiento de Bases Hayistas.  The split among the Apristas allowed former president [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] of [[Popular Action (Peru)|Acci\u00f3n Popular]] to win the election.\n\nHowever, APRA managed to win in virtual control of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. It was also during these election that [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] started his political career, after being elected Deputy for the Province of Lima.\n\nThe youthful and charismatic Garc\u00eda was elected president on April 14, 1985, with 45% of the vote during the first round. Since he did not receive the 50% of the vote required to win the presidency, Garc\u00eda was required to enter the second round against [[Alfonso Barrantes Ling\u00e1n]] (the leftist mayor of [[Lima]]) of the [[United Left (Peru)|Izquierda Unida]] Coalition. Barrantes, however, decided not to enter the second round of the elections, saying he did not want to prolong the political uncertainty of the country.\n\nGarc\u00eda was thus declared president on June 1 and officially took power on July 28, 1985. It was the first time in its sixty-year history that the populist APRA party had come to power in Peru.\n\nHis presidency was marked by world-record [[hyperinflation]] with the annual rate exceeding 13,000 percent per year. Garc\u00eda's administration devastated the local economy as well as all governmental institutions. Hunger, corruption, injustice, abuse of power, elitism, and social unrest raised to dramatic levels spreading throughout the whole nation, spurring terrorism.  \n\nAt Garc\u00eda's farewell speech, he was booed by the entire opposition forces and prevented him from speaking. The anecdotal event was televised. That same day the board of the Chamber of Deputies requested the creation of a special committee to investigate Garc\u00eda's Presidency, accusing him of massive corruption and illicit enrichment. The committee attacked Garc\u00eda with numerous proven accusations involving embezzlement, misappropriation and bribery, based -among other trustworthy sources- on a U.S. congressional investigation that linked Garc\u00eda with the BCCI scandal and had found millions of dollars in banks. New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau charged Garc\u00eda officially. Later in 1992, then Senator John Kerry presided over the BCCI Scandal Report (https://archive.org/details/TheBCCIAffair), which concluded Garc\u00eda was not only guilty of corruption, but directly involved in an international racketeering network with activities that included drug and arm trafficking. Finally, the Peruvian Supreme Court, overturned prior judiciary verdicts declaring illicitly null all the probes and constitutional accusations against Garc\u00eda.\n\nIn May 1989, APRA chose as its standard bearer [[Luis Alva Castro]]. For the final runoff, APRA sealed a hidden deal with ''[[Cambio 90]]'', [[Alberto Fujimori]], to prevent the leading candidate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], today a Nobel laureate and renown novelist and political analyst, from getting elected. Fujimori, a complete unknown, was subsequently elected. \n\nAs Fujimori assumed the Presidency in 1990, Congress was dominated by the opposition forces of [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s [[Democratic Front (Peru)|Democratic Front]]. Fujimori's party had gained only 32 deputies out of 180, and 14 senators out of 60. The majority was divided between APRA (22%) and the Democratic Front, with about 32% of Congress. In 1992, Fujimori organized a successful Coup d'Etat. This allowed Garc\u00eda to flee Peru and request asylum denouncing political persecution, the asylum was granted by president C\u00e9sar Gaviria. Shortly after, under the protection of president Francois Mitterrand, Garc\u00eda received again the privilege of political refuge and left Colombia to reside in Paris.\n\nFujimori convened elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress, in which APRA did not participate. In 1995, [[1995 Peruvian general election|general elections]] were held, and the APRA nominee for President was [[Mercedes Cabanillas]], gaining only 4%, behind former [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] (21%) and the reelected Fujimori (64%). The party only got 7 congressman out of 120, while Fujimori dominated Congress with 68.\n\nIn 2000, [[Abel Salinas]] was elected as the presidential nominee, being the worst general election for APRA, gaining 1%. Only 6 APRA congressman were elected. As many assume the election was a fraud, Fujimori resigned after the corruption of his government was revealed by the opposition.\n\nAt the [[2001 Peruvian general election|elections]], the party won 19.7% of the popular vote and 28 out of 120 seats in [[Congress of Peru|Congress]]. Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, [[Alan Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez]], won 25.8% of the vote and was defeated in the second round by [[Alejandro Toledo]].\n\nIn February 2005, Garc\u00eda officially commenced his campaign for the [[2006 Peruvian national election|2006 presidential election]]. He came in second place by a slim margin over [[Lourdes Flores]], and faced [[Ollanta Humala]] in a run-off election on June 4. He became president again as Humala conceded after exit polls and partial vote counts showed Garc\u00eda leading. [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/49A76531-B028-4524-A697-9270F81738A8.htm]. He officially took power on July 28, 2006.\n\nAPRA is a member of the [[Socialist International]].\n\nThe youth organization of APRA is known as [[Juventud Aprista Peruana]].\n\n[[Hilda Gadea]] \u2013 the first female Secretary of the Economy of the Executive National Committee for APRA; later married [[Che Guevara]] and wrote a memoir.<ref>\"[http://us.macmillan.com/mylifewithche My Life With Che] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922222633/http://us.macmillan.com/mylifewithche |date=2009-09-22 }}.\" ''[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]''.

Years of repression and clandestinity, as well as Haya de la Torre's single-handed dominance of the party, resulted in striking sectarian and hierarchical traits.<ref>Roett, Riordan. \"Peru: The Message from Garcia.\" Foreign Affairs 64.2 (1985-1986): 274-286.</ref> The party's structure and the party's hold over its rank and file proved more lasting than its original program.\n\n===Political activity since 1980===\nAfter several years of military rule, APRA was allowed to participate as a legal political party in 1979. The party gathered strong support from the electorate, managing to win a majority of seats in the newly created Constituent Assembly, and supervised the first democratic elections in 12 years.\n\nHaya de la Torre was elected president of the Constituent Assembly and was slated to run as the party's presidential candidate in 1980. However, he died before the election. The party was divided between [[Armando Villanueva]] and Andres Townsend, each one of them claiming to be the political and ideological heirs of Haya de la Torre. APRA chose Villanueva as its candidate, while Townsend and other members left the party to create the Movimiento de Bases Hayistas.  The split among the Apristas allowed former president [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] of [[Popular Action (Peru)|Acci\u00f3n Popular]] to win the election.\n\nHowever, APRA managed to win in virtual control of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. It was also during these election that [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] started his political career, after being elected Deputy for the Province of Lima.\n\nThe youthful and charismatic Garc\u00eda was elected president on April 14, 1985, with 45% of the vote during the first round. Since he did not receive the 50% of the vote required to win the presidency, Garc\u00eda was required to enter the second round against [[Alfonso Barrantes Ling\u00e1n]] (the leftist mayor of [[Lima]]) of the [[United Left (Peru)|Izquierda Unida]] Coalition. Barrantes, however, decided not to enter the second round of the elections, saying he did not want to prolong the political uncertainty of the country.\n\nGarc\u00eda was thus declared president on June 1 and officially took power on July 28, 1985. It was the first time in its sixty-year history that the populist APRA party had come to power in Peru.\n\nHis presidency was marked by world-record [[hyperinflation]] with the annual rate exceeding 13,000 percent per year. Garc\u00eda's administration devastated the local economy as well as all governmental institutions. Hunger, corruption, injustice, abuse of power, elitism, and social unrest raised to dramatic levels spreading throughout the whole nation, spurring terrorism.  \n\nAt Garc\u00eda's farewell speech, he was booed by the entire opposition forces and prevented him from speaking. The anecdotal event was televised. That same day the board of the Chamber of Deputies requested the creation of a special committee to investigate Garc\u00eda's Presidency, accusing him of massive corruption and illicit enrichment. The committee attacked Garc\u00eda with numerous proven accusations involving embezzlement, misappropriation and bribery, based -among other trustworthy sources- on a U.S. congressional investigation that linked Garc\u00eda with the BCCI scandal and had found millions of dollars in banks. New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau charged Garc\u00eda officially. Later in 1992, then Senator John Kerry presided over the BCCI Scandal Report (https://archive.org/details/TheBCCIAffair), which concluded Garc\u00eda was not only guilty of corruption, but directly involved in an international racketeering network with activities that included drug and arm trafficking. Finally, the Peruvian Supreme Court, overturned prior judiciary verdicts declaring illicitly null all the probes and constitutional accusations against Garc\u00eda.\n\nIn May 1989, APRA chose as its standard bearer [[Luis Alva Castro]]. For the final runoff, APRA sealed a hidden deal with ''[[Cambio 90]]'', [[Alberto Fujimori]], to prevent the leading candidate [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], today a Nobel laureate and renown novelist and political analyst, from getting elected. Fujimori, a complete unknown, was subsequently elected. \n\nAs Fujimori assumed the Presidency in 1990, Congress was dominated by the opposition forces of [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]'s [[Democratic Front (Peru)|Democratic Front]]. Fujimori's party had gained only 32 deputies out of 180, and 14 senators out of 60. The majority was divided between APRA (22%) and the Democratic Front, with about 32% of Congress. In 1992, Fujimori organized a successful Coup d'Etat. This allowed Garc\u00eda to flee Peru and request asylum denouncing political persecution, the asylum was granted by president C\u00e9sar Gaviria. Shortly after, under the protection of president Francois Mitterrand, Garc\u00eda received again the privilege of political refuge and left Colombia to reside in Paris.\n\nFujimori convened elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress, in which APRA did not participate. In 1995, [[1995 Peruvian general election|general elections]] were held, and the APRA nominee for President was [[Mercedes Cabanillas]], gaining only 4%, behind former [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] (21%) and the reelected Fujimori (64%). The party only got 7 congressman out of 120, while Fujimori dominated Congress with 68.\n\nIn 2000, [[Abel Salinas]] was elected as the presidential nominee, being the worst general election for APRA, gaining 1%. Only 6 APRA congressman were elected. As many assume the election was a fraud, Fujimori resigned after the corruption of his government was revealed by the opposition.\n\nAt the [[2001 Peruvian general election|elections]], the party won 19.7% of the popular vote and 28 out of 120 seats in [[Congress of Peru|Congress]]. Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, [[Alan Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez]], won 25.8% of the vote and was defeated in the second round by [[Alejandro Toledo]].\n\nIn February 2005, Garc\u00eda officially commenced his campaign for the [[2006 Peruvian national election|2006 presidential election]]. He came in second place by a slim margin over [[Lourdes Flores]], and faced [[Ollanta Humala]] in a run-off election on June 4. He became president again as Humala conceded after exit polls and partial vote counts showed Garc\u00eda leading. [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/49A76531-B028-4524-A697-9270F81738A8.htm]. He officially took power on July 28, 2006.\n\nAPRA is a member of the [[Socialist International]].\n\nThe youth organization of APRA is known as [[Juventud Aprista Peruana]].\n\n[[Hilda Gadea]] \u2013 the first female Secretary of the Economy of the Executive National Committee for APRA; later married [[Che Guevara]] and wrote a memoir.<ref>\"[http://us.macmillan.com/mylifewithche My Life With Che] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922222633/http://us.macmillan.com/mylifewithche |date=2009-09-22 }}.\" ''[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]''.
