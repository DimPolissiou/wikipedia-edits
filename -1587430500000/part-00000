The first store opened on 24 November 1979 in [[Munich]]. By 1985, nine other stores had opened near Munich. \n\nIn 1988 Kaufhof Warenhaus AG acquired a 54 percent majority in the holding company of the media stores founded in 1979.

In 1996 Kaufhof Holding, [[Metro Cash & Carry]], Deutsche SB-Kauf AG and the German department store Asko AG (where a Metro holding company had previously each held shares) merged and formed Metro AG. Since the merger into the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Media Markt and Saturn have been managed as independent brands in a centrally controlled group.\n\nIn January 2013, Metro had around 78% of the shares.

(''Go on, choose with your heart'')\n|}\n\n===2006 World Cup advertising campaign===\n\nPrior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Media Markt launched a campaign, claiming to be the \"best fan supplier\" (\"''Bester Fanausr\u00fcster''\"), with commercials showing international football fans shopping at Media Markt, showing exaggerated stereotypes of the participating countries, and making fun of the [[Austria national football team|Austria]] team, which did  not qualify. This included a French seductress, Dutch fans smoking [[marijuana]] in caravans, or a Saudi haggling - to pay more. German fans were portrayed with big bellies, asking for refrigerators to keep their beer cool, rather than looking for a new TV set.\n\nAn additional series of ads, promoting a rebate of \u20ac10 for each goal Germany scores (except [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]]), showed international soccer fans begging the Germans to score as many goals as possible - against their own team.\n\nWhen the Netherlands lost to Portugal, Media Markt used a quote from a 1980s show featuring [[Rudi Carrell]], a Dutchman who was a long-time TV celebrity in Germany, to express ''[[Schadenfreude]]''. A [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] is shown to grieving Dutch fans in their caravan with the comment \"This would have been your prize!\".\n\n===Polish advertising===\n[[File:Bydgoszcz Media Markt ulica Jagiello\u0144ska.jpg|thumb|350px|Media Markt store in Bydgoszcz, Poland]]\nIn March 2006, the \"Poland version\" showed moustache-wearing Polish customers praising the shop for \"prices deep like Polish soul\" before hugging the German sales managers, who looked quite uncomfortable in the bear hugs. Afterwards, one of the Germans pointed out that his watch was still there, and that \"The Pole is an honest person, after all\". Then, the three men are shown to be missing their trousers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEjOWqXAI7Y |title=Media Markt nie dla Polak\u00f3w |publisher=Youtube.com |date=31 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis commercial caused a scandal in Poland, for the widely known German stereotype of Poles being thieves. Media Markt argued that the advertisements also made fun of other national clich\u00e9s, including Germans, and none of the other clich\u00e9s were perceived as negative towards the people they presented. Its aim was to exaggerate the clich\u00e9 of the Polish thief to dismiss it as unjustified prejudice, Media Markt claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |title=Proteste aus Polen - Media Markt zieht Fernseh-Werbung zur\u00fcck |publisher=Focus.msn.de |date=28 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516121929/focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |archive-date=16 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe store apologised and withdrew the advert after their Polish branch asked to do so, following protests in Poland, a call from the Polish embassy in Berlin and protests from German [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]].\n\n===Portuguese advertising===\n\nIn January 2008 Media Markt launched a campaign presenting a fictitious country called \"Dumb Land\", where several characters with [[Eastern Europe]]an accents were presented as being from this country, which even has an anthem. A central theme of this campaign presented a [[Boy Scout]] as an idiot. This really upset people as many consider Scouts to be responsible and valued members of society. An online petition was created to persuade Media Markt to withdraw the campaign and to offer a public apology. Due to this petition and a lot of pressure from the Scouting movement, Media Markt had to remove the Boy Scout from their campaign, including TV and radio ads.\n\n===Turkish advertising===\n\nTurkish Union Association in [[Eski\u015fehir]], [[Turkey]] motivated suspension of an advertisement campaign by the group on grounds that Media Markt \"[[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|insulted Turkishness]]\" by depicting consumers that purchased overpriced merchandise with animal heads. A ban of the advertisements lasted for 3 months in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynew.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |title=Ads criticized for insulting Turkishness with animal heads on humans |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |archive-date=25 August 2010}}</ref> There have been many accusations on their official Facebook fan page about their false product advertisements in Turkey.\n\n=== Saubillig ===\n\nA former German campaign played on the German expression \"saubillig\" which means extremely cheap, but literally \"sow (female pig) cheap\". ''Sau-'' is a common emphasising prefix in colloquial German. Inside the stores the entrances were signposted as \"Schweingang\" = wordplay on the word Eingang (Entrance) and Schwein (pig), and the exit as \"Sausgang\" = wordplay on the word Ausgang (Exit) and the German word for sow (Sau) - the female pig.\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Misleading advertising methods ===\n==== Article without VAT ====\nMedia Markt promised in 2005 a promotion to sell items \"without [[VAT]]\" (with a discount equal to VAT). In fact, the prices for these items had previously been increased in order to actually achieve the normal price. A competitor sued a branch in Mannheim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |title=Media-Markt mogelte bei Mehrwertsteuer |publisher=ftd.de |date=8 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224021702/http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |archive-date=24 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Decoy offers ====\nThe MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group has made [[bait-and-switch]] in the past : articles were advertised extensively at extremely low prices, but were sold out within a very short time. According to case law on the law against unfair competition(UWG) advertised special offers must be available for at least two days. Consumer advocates criticized that this was often not guaranteed at Media Markt and Saturn. The group denied that; there were only a few exceptions despite large stocks. It is generally difficult to provide concrete evidence of such cases, since consumer protection groups do not have access to the delivery dates of the companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/lockvogel-angebote-gericht-knoepft-sich-media-markt-werbung-vor-a-481788.html |title=Gericht kn\u00f6pft sich Media-Markt-Werbung vor |publisher=spiegel.de |date=9 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Price Guarantee  ====\nIn 2005, samples from the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] in the Munich area showed that Media Markt or Saturn stores were more expensive in 15 out of 21 cases than local competitors. In Berlin they were 11 out of 21 cases. The MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group countered the allegations with a \"price guarantee\" that promised buyers a refund of the price difference if they found the product at a cheaper price in another shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/einzelhandel-die-trickser-vom-media-markt-1303977.html |title=Die Trickser vom Media-Markt |publisher=faz.net |date=9 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== 0 -% - financing ====\nIn 2013, 0% financing from the Spanish bank [[Banco Santander]] was criticized. A credit loss insurance that costs 10% is taken out only on a note in the small print.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://helpv2.orf.at/stories/1714801/index.html |title=Kreditversicherung wider Willen |publisher=orf.at |date=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The exclusive sale of Intel PCs ===\nAccording to research published by the [[Financial Times]] Germany in 2008, the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group committed to [[Intel]] in 1999 to only sell PCs with Intel processors. The holding company received 85 million euros in purchase discounts and advertising grants from Intel in 2007 alone. The European antitrust authorities investigated the distortion of competition. Intel was fined 1.06 billion euros in May 2009 by the European Competition Commission for these and other antitrust violations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/wettbewerbsverstoesse-intels-praktiken-schockieren-kartellrechtler-a-624575.html |title=Intels Praktiken schockieren Kartellrechtler |publisher=spiegel.de |date=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe retail chain was moved by Intel's discount system to have only insignificant or no computers with [[AMD]] processors in the range. According to the [[European Commission]], Intel has made direct and indirect payments to MSH since 1997. The payments were subject to the condition that, if possible, only offer Intel systems.\n\n=== Body searches ===\n\nIn 2014, in [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]], theft of the Media Markt, which is said to have been committed by employees, not only carried out bag checks, as is common in many companies, but also body searches on all employees. The unions see this as a violation of [[human dignity]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://noe.orf.at/v2/news/stories/2624102/ |title=Leibesvisitation bei Mitarbeitern |publisher=orf.at |date=7 January 2014}}</ref> As a consequence, employees of other branches in Austria reported this procedure.

(''Go on, choose with your heart'')\n|}\n\n===2006 World Cup advertising campaign===\n\nPrior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Media Markt launched a campaign, claiming to be the \"best fan supplier\" (\"''Bester Fanausr\u00fcster''\"), with commercials showing international football fans shopping at Media Markt, showing exaggerated stereotypes of the participating countries, and making fun of the [[Austria national football team|Austria]] team, which did  not qualify. This included a French seductress, Dutch fans smoking [[marijuana]] in caravans, or a Saudi haggling - to pay more. German fans were portrayed with big bellies, asking for refrigerators to keep their beer cool, rather than looking for a new TV set.\n\nAn additional series of ads, promoting a rebate of \u20ac10 for each goal Germany scores (except [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]]), showed international soccer fans begging the Germans to score as many goals as possible - against their own team.\n\nWhen the Netherlands lost to Portugal, Media Markt used a quote from a 1980s show featuring [[Rudi Carrell]], a Dutchman who was a long-time TV celebrity in Germany, to express ''[[Schadenfreude]]''. A [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] is shown to grieving Dutch fans in their caravan with the comment \"This would have been your prize!\".\n\n===Polish advertising===\n[[File:Bydgoszcz Media Markt ulica Jagiello\u0144ska.jpg|thumb|350px|Media Markt store in Bydgoszcz, Poland]]\nIn March 2006, the \"Poland version\" showed moustache-wearing Polish customers praising the shop for \"prices deep like Polish soul\" before hugging the German sales managers, who looked quite uncomfortable in the bear hugs. Afterwards, one of the Germans pointed out that his watch was still there, and that \"The Pole is an honest person, after all\". Then, the three men are shown to be missing their trousers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEjOWqXAI7Y |title=Media Markt nie dla Polak\u00f3w |publisher=Youtube.com |date=31 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis commercial caused a scandal in Poland, for the widely known German stereotype of Poles being thieves. Media Markt argued that the advertisements also made fun of other national clich\u00e9s, including Germans, and none of the other clich\u00e9s were perceived as negative towards the people they presented. Its aim was to exaggerate the clich\u00e9 of the Polish thief to dismiss it as unjustified prejudice, Media Markt claimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |title=Proteste aus Polen - Media Markt zieht Fernseh-Werbung zur\u00fcck |publisher=Focus.msn.de |date=28 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516121929/focus.msn.de/finanzen/news/proteste-aus-polen_nid_26829.html |archive-date=16 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe store apologised and withdrew the advert after their Polish branch asked to do so, following protests in Poland, a call from the Polish embassy in Berlin and protests from German [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]].\n\n===Portuguese advertising===\n\nIn January 2008 Media Markt launched a campaign presenting a fictitious country called \"Dumb Land\", where several characters with [[Eastern Europe]]an accents were presented as being from this country, which even has an anthem. A central theme of this campaign presented a [[Boy Scout]] as an idiot. This really upset people as many consider Scouts to be responsible and valued members of society. An online petition was created to persuade Media Markt to withdraw the campaign and to offer a public apology. Due to this petition and a lot of pressure from the Scouting movement, Media Markt had to remove the Boy Scout from their campaign, including TV and radio ads.\n\n===Turkish advertising===\n\nTurkish Union Association in [[Eski\u015fehir]], [[Turkey]] motivated suspension of an advertisement campaign by the group on grounds that Media Markt \"[[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|insulted Turkishness]]\" by depicting consumers that purchased overpriced merchandise with animal heads. A ban of the advertisements lasted for 3 months in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynew.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |title=Ads criticized for insulting Turkishness with animal heads on humans |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185814/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=did-animals-really-insult-turkishness-2009-10-22 |archive-date=25 August 2010}}</ref> There have been many accusations on their official Facebook fan page about their false product advertisements in Turkey.\n\n=== Saubillig ===\n\nA former German campaign played on the German expression \"saubillig\" which means extremely cheap, but literally \"sow (female pig) cheap\". ''Sau-'' is a common emphasising prefix in colloquial German. Inside the stores the entrances were signposted as \"Schweingang\" = wordplay on the word Eingang (Entrance) and Schwein (pig), and the exit as \"Sausgang\" = wordplay on the word Ausgang (Exit) and the German word for sow (Sau) - the female pig.\n\n== Controversies ==\n=== Misleading advertising methods ===\n==== Article without VAT ====\nMedia Markt promised in 2005 a promotion to sell items \"without [[VAT]]\" (with a discount equal to VAT). In fact, the prices for these items had previously been increased in order to actually achieve the normal price. A competitor sued a branch in Mannheim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |title=Media-Markt mogelte bei Mehrwertsteuer |publisher=ftd.de |date=8 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224021702/http://www.ftd.de/unternehmen/handel_dienstleister/129743.html |archive-date=24 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Decoy offers ====\nThe MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group has made [[bait-and-switch]] in the past : articles were advertised extensively at extremely low prices, but were sold out within a very short time. According to case law on the law against unfair competition(UWG) advertised special offers must be available for at least two days. Consumer advocates criticized that this was often not guaranteed at Media Markt and Saturn. The group denied that; there were only a few exceptions despite large stocks. It is generally difficult to provide concrete evidence of such cases, since consumer protection groups do not have access to the delivery dates of the companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/lockvogel-angebote-gericht-knoepft-sich-media-markt-werbung-vor-a-481788.html |title=Gericht kn\u00f6pft sich Media-Markt-Werbung vor |publisher=spiegel.de |date=9 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Price Guarantee  ====\nIn 2005, samples from the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] in the Munich area showed that Media Markt or Saturn stores were more expensive in 15 out of 21 cases than local competitors. In Berlin they were 11 out of 21 cases. The MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group countered the allegations with a \"price guarantee\" that promised buyers a refund of the price difference if they found the product at a cheaper price in another shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/einzelhandel-die-trickser-vom-media-markt-1303977.html |title=Die Trickser vom Media-Markt |publisher=faz.net |date=9 January 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== 0 -% - financing ====\nIn 2013, 0% financing from the Spanish bank [[Banco Santander]] was criticized. A credit loss insurance that costs 10% is taken out only on a note in the small print.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://helpv2.orf.at/stories/1714801/index.html |title=Kreditversicherung wider Willen |publisher=orf.at |date=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The exclusive sale of Intel PCs ===\nAccording to research published by the [[Financial Times]] Germany in 2008, the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group committed to [[Intel]] in 1999 to only sell PCs with Intel processors. The holding company received 85 million euros in purchase discounts and advertising grants from Intel in 2007 alone. The European antitrust authorities investigated the distortion of competition. Intel was fined 1.06 billion euros in May 2009 by the European Competition Commission for these and other antitrust violations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/wettbewerbsverstoesse-intels-praktiken-schockieren-kartellrechtler-a-624575.html |title=Intels Praktiken schockieren Kartellrechtler |publisher=spiegel.de |date=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe retail chain was moved by Intel's discount system to have only insignificant or no computers with [[AMD]] processors in the range. According to the [[European Commission]], Intel has made direct and indirect payments to MSH since 1997. The payments were subject to the condition that, if possible, only offer Intel systems.\n\n=== Body searches ===\n\nIn 2014, in [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]], theft of the Media Markt, which is said to have been committed by employees, not only carried out bag checks, as is common in many companies, but also body searches on all employees. The unions see this as a violation of [[human dignity]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://noe.orf.at/v2/news/stories/2624102/ |title=Leibesvisitation bei Mitarbeitern |publisher=orf.at |date=7 January 2014}}</ref> As a consequence, employees of other branches in Austria reported this procedure.

{"title_page": "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga", "text_new": "'''Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga''' (4 May 1932, [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]], [[Spain]]) is a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Basques|Basque]] [[fine art|artist]] and experimental [[filmmaking|filmmaker]] best known for his feature-length [[direct films|hand-painted \"direct\" film]], ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' (1968\u201370). He lives in Ciboure (France) and works in San Sebastian (Spain).\n\n== Early works ==\n\nDuring the Spanish civil war, as a son of a republican Basque, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga had to escape from Bilbao with part of his family to Bordeaux (France) after the bombing of Guernica in April 1937. In 1955, he settled in Paris where he met the Andalusian painter Manuel Duque,<ref>Cf Jean-Michel Bouhours \"Del nubismo a las profundidades del comos. Un panteismo visual\" in cat Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga. De la pintura gestual al arte del movimiento. Fundacion Museo Jorge Oteiza. Pamplona, Navarra  2015</ref> executed  his first paintings in Paris, in the context of the Informal painting movement. His early works (black paintings) date back to 1959 : abstract, non-geometrical, they could be compared to Henri Michaux's or Jean Fautrier's works, despite the fact Sistiaga never heard about these artists at this moment.<ref>Cf Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga Lorategi irudikatu bateko islak. Exhibition catalog directed by Jean-Michel Bouhours, San Sebastian (Spain) Koldo Mitxelena, 2011</ref> Back in basque country, Sistiaga met the sculptor Jorge Oteiza. In 1963 he created a workshop for  free expression dedicated to children, influenced by alternative pedagogic method of Celestin Freynet ; he collaborated in that direction with artist Esther Ferrer for a project based in Elorrio. During these years (60's) Sistiaga has a reel interdisciplinary artistic strategy and interest between alternative teaching, performances, contemporary music and cinema. In 1966, he formed along with other Basque artists the influential avant-gard group [[Gaur (artistic group)|Gaur]]. This collective gathered the following artists : Jorge Oteiza, Rafael Ruiz Balerdi, Eduardo Chillida, Remedio Mendiburu, N\u00e9stor Basterretxea, Amable Arias, Jos\u00e9 Luis Zumeta and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga.<ref>see http://www.artium.es and also ''Constellation Gaur : una trama vanguardist del arte vasco = Gaur konstelazioa abangoardiako area euskal artean'' (exh cat). Vitoria Gasteiz, Caja Vital, Obra social = Vital Kutza, Gizarte-Ekintza, D.L 2004</ref> Sistiaga focused his pictorial and graphic works on energy, movement, gesture : his works on canvas or paper seem to be seismographs of sensibilities and emotions.\n\n== Alternative teachings, conferences and performances ==\n\nSistiaga discovered in Paris the artistic alternative workshop dedicated to childs created by Arno Stern : ''L'Acad\u00e9mie des jeudis''. Stern searched to reveal the original creativity of the children, far from the artistic education.<ref>For more information see official website www.arnostern.com</ref> Sistiaga will create similar workshops when he will be back in Spain (San Sebastian) with the help of artist Esther Ferrer : ''La Academia de los jueves'', which will be active from 1963 to 1968. In Parallel, he was in touch with Celestin Freinet, who created the Methode Freinet of teaching, based on development of the child from his own capacities. Sistiaga organized exhibitions in basque countries of children creations, sometimes with his own works<ref>see Jaione Apalategi Begiristain \"Sistiaga y la education de la libre expresion\" in catalog Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga De la painter gestural al arte del movement keen bidezko pinturatik mugimenduaren artery. Pamplona, 2015, Fundacion Museo Jorge Oteiza.</ref>\n\n== Experimental cinema==\n\nAfter seeing in Paris a Norman Mac Laren's film, he decided to improve this medium to pass over his pictorial strategies.  He exhibited his first film in 1968 at the [[Bilbao]] Short Film Festival. Titled ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' (a nonsense phrase coined by Sistiaga's friend Rafa Ruiz Balerdi), it won a prize for best experimental film. This 10-minute short, hand-painted in a fairly conventional cartoon style, was later renamed ''De la Luna a Euskadi'' (\"From the Moon to the Basque Country\").\nThanks to the help of collector and patron from Navarra Juan Huarte, who created a film production company X-Films to produce films made by basque artists from the ''Gaur'' Movement (Balerdi, Basterretxea, Sistiaga), the artist began painting his abstract [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] in 1968. It took 17 months of 10- to 12-hour days to complete. The silent, 75-minute ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' was first exhibited at Madrid in 1970. The technique is hand painted film. Sistiaga used the same vocabulary of his paintings (lines, points, colour) onto the film celluloid and obtained random patterns of colored points that evokes the atomic matter or the \"Primitive soup\" of universe. \nSubsequent screenings took place in London, Paris, Barcelona and New York City.\nEach of the approximately 108,000 frames in ''... era erera'' is completely unique, and appears onscreen for only 1/24th of a second. No optical printing techniques or special photographic effects were employed in its production.\n\n''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' is the first feature-length example of [[direct films|\"direct\" cameraless filmmaking]], a painstaking technique dating back to the early 1900s. Other well-known artists in the genre include [[Len Lye]], [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]], [[Norman McLaren]] (whose work Sistiaga cites as a direct influence) and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n\nIn 1972, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga participated to the International Art Event Encuentros de Pamplona with painting and his films. Juan Huarte (patron of the event)<ref>Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz Cuy\u00e1s, Patricia Molins, Francisco Javier San Mart\u00edn, Carmen Pardo Salgado, Pepa Bueno, Vicente J.

Madrid, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, DL, 2009</ref>\nDuring this period, Sistiaga painted large paintings with curves, lines on white canvas<ref>We can see such paintings in the permanent collections of Museo de bellas artes in Bilbao or Museo nacional centro de arte Reina Sofia in Madrid</ref>\n\n== Later hand-painted films and recent paintings ==\n\nIn 1988-89, Sistiaga painted a new direct film ''Impresiones en la alta atm\u00f3sfera'' (\"Impressions from the Upper Atmosphere\") in 70mm 15-perf horizontal format, intended for exhibition in giant-screen [[IMAX]] and [[IMAX|Omnimax]] theaters.\n\nFrom the middle of 90's, the artist got a generous space in Antiguo district (in San Sebastian), allowing the artist to produce his huger canvas : Cosmos Oceano, The Four Seasons, Maurice Ravel's tribute are some of them.\n\nTwo additional 35mm films using a different technique, filming hand painting transparents,  ''Paisaje inquietante Nocturno'' (\"Disturbing Nocturnal Landscape\") and ''En un jardin imaginado'' (\"In an Imaginary Garden\"), were completed in 1991.\n\nSince then, Sistiaga began working on a new film onto 70 mm celluloid with IMAX format : ''Han. Sobre el sol''. Still unfinished ( only 2 minutes have been released), this film explores the cosmic iconography of stars and galaxies ; with this aim, the artist used two animation techniques : \"direct film\" (hand painted film) and animation frame after frame for fixing in the frame a form.<ref>CF illustrations in ibidem, p 144-145</ref>\n\nPainterly and cinematic processes nourish each other in Sistiaga's works. The artist has been working since 2011 on a new typology of paintings on board, following Jackson Pollock's dripping technique ; this series is composed of two sorts of works: first, those which get the impact of the gesture on the board surface and, second, those which collect splatters or splashes from a distance. This strategy which aims at collecting on the surface traces of vital energy, has links with alchemical processes or for example interest of artists for magnetism and all other emanations of invisible .\n\nHis films are part of permanent collections of eminent museums in the world : Centre Pompidou, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (Paris) and Museo de arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. You can see Sistiaga's paintings at the Museo de bellas artes in Bilbao, at the Museo San Telmo in San Sebastian or at the Museo nacional Centro de arte Reina Sofia in Madrid.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n* ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...''

He lives in Ciboure (France) and works in San Sebastian (Spain).\n\n== Early works ==\n\nDuring the Spanish civil war, as a son of a republican Basque, Jos\u00e9 Antonio  Sistiaga had to escape from Bilbao with part of his family to Bordeaux (France) after the bombing of Guernica in April 1937. In 1955, he settled in Paris where he met the Andalusian painter Manuel Duque,<ref>Cf Jean-Michel Bouhours \"Del nubismo a las profundidades del comos. Un panteismo visual\" in cat Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga. De la pintura gestual al arte del movimiento. Fundacion Museo Jorge Oteiza. Pamplona, Navarra  2015</ref> executed  his first paintings in Paris, in the context of the Informal painting movement. His early works (black paintings) date back to 1959 : abstract, non-geometrical, they could be compared to Henri Michaux's or Jean Fautrier's works, despite the fact Sistiaga never heard about these artists at this moment.<ref>Cf Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga Lorategi irudikatu bateko islak. Exhibition catalog directed by Jean-Michel Bouhours, San Sebastian (Spain) Koldo Mitxelena, 2011</ref> Back in basque country, Sistiaga met the sculptor Jorge Oteiza. In 1963 he created a workshop for  free expression dedicated to children, influenced by alternative pedagogic method of Celestin Freynet ; he collaborated in that direction with artist Esther Ferrer for a project based in Elorrio. During these years (60's) Sistiaga has a reel interdisciplinary artistic strategy and interest between alternative teaching, performances, contemporary music and cinema. In 1966, he formed along with other Basque artists the influential avant-gard group [[Gaur (artistic group)|Gaur]]. This collective gathered the following artists : Jorge Oteiza, Rafael Ruiz Balerdi, Eduardo Chillida, Remedio Mendiburu, N\u00e9stor Basterretxea, Amable Arias, Jos\u00e9 Luis Zumeta and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga.<ref>see http://www.artium.es and also ''Constellation Gaur : una trama vanguardist del arte vasco = Gaur konstelazioa abangoardiako area euskal artean'' (exh cat). Vitoria Gasteiz, Caja Vital, Obra social = Vital Kutza, Gizarte-Ekintza, D.L 2004</ref> Sistiaga focused his pictorial and graphic works on energy, movement, gesture : his works on canvas or paper seem to be seismographs of sensibilities and emotions.\n\n== Alternative teachings, conferences and performances ==\n\nSistiaga discovered in Paris the artistic alternative workshop dedicated to childs created by Arno Stern : ''L'Acad\u00e9mie des jeudis''. Stern searched to reveal the original creativity of the children, far from the artistic education.<ref>For more information see official website www.arnostern.com</ref> Sistiaga will create similar workshops when he will be back in Spain (San Sebastian) with the help of artist Esther Ferrer : ''La Academia de los jueves'', which will be active from 1963 to 1968. In Parallel, he was in touch with Celestin Freinet, who created the Methode Freinet of teaching, based on development of the child from his own capacities. Sistiaga organized exhibitions in basque countries of children creations, sometimes with his own works<ref>see Jaione Apalategi Begiristain \"Sistiaga y la education de la libre expresion\" in catalog Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga De la painter gestural al arte del movement keen bidezko pinturatik mugimenduaren artery. Pamplona, 2015, Fundacion Museo Jorge Oteiza.</ref>\n\n== Experimental cinema==\n\nAfter seeing in Paris a Norman Mac Laren's film, he decided to improve this medium to pass over his pictorial strategies.  He exhibited his first film in 1968 at the [[Bilbao]] Short Film Festival. Titled ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' (a nonsense phrase coined by Sistiaga's friend Rafa Ruiz Balerdi), it won a prize for best experimental film. This 10-minute short, hand-painted in a fairly conventional cartoon style, was later renamed ''De la Luna a Euskadi'' (\"From the Moon to the Basque Country\").\nThanks to the help of collector and patron from Navarra Juan Huarte, who created a film production company X-Films to produce films made by basque artists from the ''Gaur'' Movement (Balerdi, Basterretxea, Sistiaga), the artist began painting his abstract [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] in 1968. It took 17 months of 10- to 12-hour days to complete. The silent, 75-minute ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' was first exhibited at Madrid in 1970. The technique is hand painted film. Sistiaga used the same vocabulary of his paintings (lines, points, colour) onto the film celluloid and obtained random patterns of colored points that evokes the atomic matter or the \"Primitive soup\" of universe. \nSubsequent screenings took place in London, Paris, Barcelona and New York City.\nEach of the approximately 108,000 frames in ''... era erera'' is completely unique, and appears onscreen for only 1/24th of a second. No optical printing techniques or special photographic effects were employed in its production.\n\n''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...'' is the first feature-length example of [[direct films|\"direct\" cameraless filmmaking]], a painstaking technique dating back to the early 1900s. Other well-known artists in the genre include [[Len Lye]], [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]], [[Norman McLaren]] (whose work Sistiaga cites as a direct influence) and [[Stan Brakhage]].\n\nIn 1972, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sistiaga participated to the International Art Event Encuentros de Pamplona with painting and his films. Juan Huarte (patron of the event)<ref>Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz Cuy\u00e1s, Patricia Molins, Francisco Javier San Mart\u00edn, Carmen Pardo Salgado, Pepa Bueno, Vicente J. Benet, Esteban Pujals Encuentros de Pamplona Fin de fiesta del arte experimental.

Madrid, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, DL, 2009</ref>\nDuring this period, Sistiaga painted large paintings with curves, lines on white canvas<ref>We can see such paintings in the permanent collections of Museo de bellas artes in Bilbao or Museo nacional centro de arte Reina Sofia in Madrid</ref>\n\n== Later hand-painted films and recent paintings ==\n\nIn 1988-89, Sistiaga painted a new direct film ''Impresiones en la alta atm\u00f3sfera'' (\"Impressions from the Upper Atmosphere\") in 70mm 15-perf horizontal format, intended for exhibition in giant-screen [[IMAX]] and [[IMAX|Omnimax]] theaters.\n\nFrom the middle of 90's, the artist got a generous space in Antiguo district (in San Sebastian), allowing the artist to produce his huger canvas : Cosmos Oceano, The Four Seasons, Maurice Ravel's tribute are some of them.\n\nTwo additional 35mm films using a different technique, filming hand painting transparents,  ''Paisaje inquietante Nocturno'' (\"Disturbing Nocturnal Landscape\") and ''En un jardin imaginado'' (\"In an Imaginary Garden\"), were completed in 1991.\n\nSince then, Sistiaga began working on a new film onto 70 mm celluloid with IMAX format : ''Han. Sobre el sol''. Still unfinished ( only 2 minutes have been released), this film explores the cosmic iconography of stars and galaxies ; with this aim, the artist used two animation techniques : \"direct film\" (hand painted film) and animation frame after frame for fixing in the frame a form.<ref>CF illustrations in ibidem, p 144-145</ref>\n\nPainterly and cinematic processes nourish each other in Sistiaga's works. The artist has been working since 2011 on a new typology of paintings on board, following Jackson Pollock's dripping technique ; this series is composed of two sorts of works: first, those which get the impact of the gesture on the board surface and, second, those which collect splatters or splashes from a distance. This strategy which aims at collecting on the surface traces of vital energy, has links with alchemical processes or for example interest of artists for magnetism and all other emanations of invisible .\n\nHis films are part of permanent collections of eminent museums in the world : Centre Pompidou, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (Paris) and Museo de arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. You can see Sistiaga's paintings at the Museo de bellas artes in Bilbao, at the Museo San Telmo in San Sebastian or at the Museo nacional Centro de arte Reina Sofia in Madrid.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n* ''... era erera baleibu izik subua aruaren ...''

When the [[Amalgamation of Toronto|city amalgamated that year]], Toronto grew to encompass the former municipalities of [[York, Toronto|York]], [[East York]], [[North York]], [[Etobicoke]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]]. Each of these former municipalities still maintains, to a certain degree, its own distinct identity, and the names of these municipalities are still used by their residents, sometimes for disambiguation purposes as amalgamation resulted in duplicated street names. The area known as Toronto before the amalgamation is sometimes called the \"old\" City of Toronto, the Central District or simply \"Downtown\".\n\nThe [[Old Toronto|\"former\" City of Toronto]] is, by far, the most populous and densest part of the city. It is also the business and administrative centre of the city. The uniquely Torontonian [[bay-and-gable]] housing style is common throughout the former city.\n\nThe \"inner ring\" suburbs of York and East York are older, predominantly middle-income areas, and ethnically diverse. Much of the housing stock in these areas consists of pre-World War II single-family houses and post-war high-rises. Many of the neighbourhoods in these areas were built up as [[streetcar suburb]]s and contain many dense and mixed-use streets, some of which are one-way. They share many characteristics with sections of the \"old\" city, outside the downtown core.\n\nThe \"outer ring\" suburbs of Etobicoke, Scarborough, and North York are much more [[suburb]]an in nature (although these boroughs are developing urban centres of their own, such as [[North York City Centre]] around [[Mel Lastman Square]]). The following is a list of the more notable neighbourhoods, divided by the neighbourhoods' location based on the former municipalities, the names of which are still known and commonly used by Torontonians (and are necessary for disambiguating duplicate street names).\n\nToronto has many groups and associations to deal with neighbourhood issues, and larger [[umbrella organization]]s organize events to deal with broader issues.\n\n==Neighbourhoods by district==\n===[[Old Toronto]]===\nOld Toronto refers to the City of Toronto and its boundaries from 1967 to 1997. It is sometimes referred to as the \"South\" or \"Central\" district, and includes the \"downtown core\". Some of these names such as \"The Fashion District\"  are (or were) used as marketing for the areas or by BIAs; this area is actually called \"King-Spadina\" by locals.  Another example is the \"[[York, Upper Canada|Old Town of York]]\", also known as \"King and Parliament\" (although that intersection is one block east of the original ten blocks that formed the old town). Some people in the area also consider it to be a suburb of the main city of Toronto, as many choose to move there in pursuit of a more relaxed and \"backwoods\" vibe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/canada/toronto/areas-and-suburbs-in-toronto|title=Areas and Suburbs in Toronto {{!}} Expat Arrivals|date=2014-05-16|website=Expat Arrivals|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}</ref>\n\nMany were recreated or named to reconnect the areas with their past history, early beginnings, or even recent use and prominence. Some historical city 'wards' used in the 19th century are no longer used: St. David's, St. John's, St. Paul's, St. George's, St. Andrew's, and St. Patrick's wards.  There was a ward named for the patron saint of each of the three British nationalities: English ([[Saint George|St. George]]), Scottish ([[Andrew the Apostle|St. Andrew]]), Welsh ([[Saint David|St. David]]) and Irish ([[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]]). {{ttcs|St. George}}, {{ttcs|St. Andrew}} and {{ttcs|St. Patrick}} still survive as subway stops, though St. George station is not named after the ward, but after St. George Street instead, itself named after Quetton St. George, a local resident.

These divisions are used for internal planning purposes. The boundaries and names often do not conform to the usage of the general population or designated business improvement areas. A number of neighbourhood maps of Toronto do exist, some produced by real estate firms and some by Internet portals. A project to map the neighbourhoods according to the common usage of the residents was done by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' broadsheet newspaper. Based on feedback from ''Star'' readers, it has produced a comprehensive, albeit informal, neighbourhood map.\n\n==Multiple listing service districts and neighbourhoods==\nAfter the update of Toronto [[Multiple listing service]] (MLS) on July 5, 2011, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) introduced a new search feature for the Toronto MLS, used by [[Real estate broker|real estate agents]] operating in the region. MLS searches can be refined at three levels and MLS users can search houses by area, then by [[municipality]], and then by neighbourhood or community. As with the other MLS services for other jurisdictions, it used [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing Maps]] for its web mapping features until 2018, when it switched to [[Google Maps]]. These feature changes were the first change of this magnitude in about 50 years of Toronto MLS history.<ref name=\"JS_TREB_MLS_article\">[http://jamiesarner.com/toronto-real-estate/2011/07/new-zoning-toronto-mls-neighbourhoods-municipalities/ New Zoning in Toronto MLS Brings Neighbourhood Names and Municipalities] by Jamie Sarner, accessed on July 5, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe change was designed to eliminate the obsolete coding systems whereby [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto]] was divided into 86 artificial districts denominated by [[alphanumeric]] codes. Due to the growing population in the city and the increasing difficulty of browsing the code-based system, the TREB made a radical change, which is intended to simplify the use of MLS for real estate agents and home buyers.<ref name=\"ILT_TREB_MLS_article\">[http://ilovetoronto.com/toronto-real-estate/2011/07/mls-zoning-change-treb-community-names MLS Zoning Change: TREB Introducing Friendly Community Names] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711032508/http://ilovetoronto.com/toronto-real-estate/2011/07/mls-zoning-change-treb-community-names |date=2011-07-11 }} by ILoveToronto.com, accessed on July 5, 2011.</ref>\n\nBecause Toronto is a populous municipality of its own, the core city area will continue to be split into coded districts, although each of the districts will in turn contain neighbourhoods.

When the [[Amalgamation of Toronto|city amalgamated that year]], Toronto grew to encompass the former municipalities of [[York, Toronto|York]], [[East York]], [[North York]], [[Etobicoke]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]]. Each of these former municipalities still maintains, to a certain degree, its own distinct identity, and the names of these municipalities are still used by their residents, sometimes for disambiguation purposes as amalgamation resulted in duplicated street names. The area known as Toronto before the amalgamation is sometimes called the \"old\" City of Toronto, the Central District or simply \"Downtown\".\n\nThe [[Old Toronto|\"former\" City of Toronto]] is, by far, the most populous and densest part of the city. It is also the business and administrative centre of the city. The uniquely Torontonian [[bay-and-gable]] housing style is common throughout the former city.\n\nThe \"inner ring\" suburbs of York and East York are older, predominantly middle-income areas, and ethnically diverse. Much of the housing stock in these areas consists of pre-World War II single-family houses and post-war high-rises. Many of the neighbourhoods in these areas were built up as [[streetcar suburb]]s and contain many dense and mixed-use streets, some of which are one-way. They share many characteristics with sections of the \"old\" city, outside the downtown core.\n\nThe \"outer ring\" suburbs of Etobicoke, Scarborough, and North York are much more [[suburb]]an in nature (although these boroughs are developing urban centres of their own, such as [[North York City Centre]] around [[Mel Lastman Square]]). The following is a list of the more notable neighbourhoods, divided by the neighbourhoods' location based on the former municipalities, the names of which are still known and commonly used by Torontonians (and are necessary for disambiguating duplicate street names).\n\nToronto has many groups and associations to deal with neighbourhood issues, and larger [[umbrella organization]]s organize events to deal with broader issues.\n\n==Neighbourhoods by district==\n===[[Old Toronto]]===\nOld Toronto refers to the City of Toronto and its boundaries from 1967 to 1997. It is sometimes referred to as the \"South\" or \"Central\" district, and includes the \"downtown core\". Some of these names such as \"The Fashion District\"  are (or were) used as marketing for the areas or by BIAs; this area is actually called \"King-Spadina\" by locals.  Another example is the \"[[York, Upper Canada|Old Town of York]]\", also known as \"King and Parliament\" (although that intersection is one block east of the original ten blocks that formed the old town). Some people in the area also consider it to be a suburb of the main city of Toronto, as many choose to move there in pursuit of a more relaxed and \"backwoods\" vibe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.expatarrivals.com/canada/toronto/areas-and-suburbs-in-toronto|title=Areas and Suburbs in Toronto {{!}} Expat Arrivals|date=2014-05-16|website=Expat Arrivals|language=en|access-date=2017-04-23}}</ref>\n\nMany were recreated or named to reconnect the areas with their past history, early beginnings, or even recent use and prominence. Some historical city 'wards' used in the 19th century are no longer used: St. David's, St. John's, St. Paul's, St. George's, St. Andrew's, and St. Patrick's wards.  There was a ward named for the patron saint of each of the three British nationalities: English ([[Saint George|St. George]]), Scottish ([[Andrew the Apostle|St. Andrew]]), Welsh ([[Saint David|St. David]]) and Irish ([[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]]). {{ttcs|St. George}}, {{ttcs|St. Andrew}} and {{ttcs|St. Patrick}} still survive as subway stops, though St. George station is not named after the ward, but after St. George Street instead, itself named after Quetton St. George, a local resident.  St. Lawrence's Ward (named after [[Saint Lawrence|the patron saint of Canada]] and the [[Saint Lawrence River|river]]) remains, known today as \"St. Lawrence\". [[Toronto\u2014St. Paul's|St. Paul's]] (named after [[Paul the Apostle|the saint]]) remains as the name of an electoral district for each of the three levels of government, although the electoral district has very little to no overlap with the historic St. Paul's Ward and beginning in the [[2015 Canadian federal election]], the electoral district was renamed Toronto\u2014St. Paul's. This meant that the St. Paul's electoral district is a [[misnomer]] for much of the history of the electoral district.\n\nFor the purposes of geographic distinction, the neighbourhoods of Old Toronto are broken down into four subsections:\n\n====[[Downtown Toronto|Downtown Core (Central)]]====\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Alexandra Park, Toronto|Alexandra Park]]\n* [[The Annex]]\n* [[Baldwin Village]]\n* [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]]\n* [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]\n* [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatown]]\n* [[Church and Wellesley]]\n* [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]]\n* [[Discovery District]]\n* [[Distillery District]]\n* [[Toronto Entertainment District|The Entertainment District]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[East Bayfront]]\n* [[Fashion District, Toronto|Fashion District]]\n* [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]]\n* [[Garden District, Toronto|Garden District]]\n* [[Grange Park (neighbourhood)|Grange Park]]\n* [[Harbord Village]]\n* [[Harbourfront (Toronto)|Harbourfront]]\n* [[Kensington Market]]\n* [[Little Japan, Toronto|Little Japan]]<!--Do not bypass redirect per --WP:NOTBROKEN--><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/life/2016/05/11/japanese-influence-is-seeping-into-downtown-toronto.html|title=Japanese influence is seeping into downtown Toronto |work=Toronto Star |date=May 11, 2016 |last=Liu |first=Karon}}</ref>\n* [[Moss Park]]\n* [[Old Town, Toronto|Old Town]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Quayside, Toronto|Quayside]] (future planned neighbourhood)\n* [[Queen Street West]]<!--Please don't add Railway Lands, as it was later split into CityPlace to the west and South Core to the east-->\n* [[Regent Park]]<!--Please don't add Railway Lands, as it was later split into CityPlace to the west and South Core to the east-->\n* [[South Core, Toronto|South Core]]\n* [[St. James Town]]\n* [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]]\n* [[Toronto Islands]]\n* [[Trefann Court]]\n* [[University of Toronto|University]] (includes Huron\u2013Sussex)\n* [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]]\n{{Col-break}}\n[[File:CabbagetownBuildings2004.jpg|thumb|right|Old newspaper office in [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]]]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n====[[East Toronto|East End]]====\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[The Beaches]] (also known as The Beach)\n* [[East Chinatown, Toronto|East Chinatown]]\n* [[East Danforth]]\n* [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Gerrard Street East]] ([[Gerrard India Bazaar]] or Little India)\n* [[Greektown, Toronto|Greektown]] (also known as the Danforth)\n* [[Leslieville]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Main Square (Toronto)|Main Square]]\n* [[Playter Estates]]\n* [[Port Lands]] (includes Villiers Island, a future planned neighbourhood on an artificial island)\n* [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]]\n* [[Upper Beaches]]\n{{Col-break}}\n[[Image:Stocking Up.jpg|thumb|right|Shops along Queen Street East in [[the Beaches]]]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n====North End====\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Bedford Park, Toronto|Bedford Park]]\n* [[Casa Loma (neighbourhood)|Casa Loma]]\n* [[Chaplin Estates]]\n* [[Davisville Village]]\n* [[Deer Park, Toronto|Deer Park]] (Yonge and St. Clair)\n* [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]] (and Forest Hill Village and Upper Village)\n* [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]]\n* [[Lytton Park]]\n* [[Midtown, Toronto|Midtown]]\n* [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[North Toronto]]\n* [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]]\n* [[South Hill, Toronto|South Hill]] (includes Rathnelly)\n* [[Summerhill, Toronto|Summerhill]]\n* [[Uptown Toronto|Uptown]]\n* [[Wanless Park]]\n* [[Wychwood Park]]\n* [[Yonge\u2013Eglinton]] (considered centre of Midtown Toronto)\n{{Col-break}}\n[[Image:Lascalles Avenue Chaplin Estates.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chaplin Estates]] in [[North Toronto]]]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n====West End====\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Little Portugal, Toronto|Beaconsfield Village]]\n* [[Bloor West Village]]\n* [[Bracondale Hill]]\n* [[Brockton Village]]\n* [[Carleton Village]]\n* [[Corso Italia (Toronto)|Corso Italia]]\n* [[Davenport, Toronto|Davenport]]\n* [[Dovercourt Park]]\n* [[Dufferin Grove]]\n* [[Earlscourt]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Fort York (neighbourhood)|Fort York]]\n* [[High Park North|High Park]]\n* [[The Junction]] (formerly West Toronto;

In 1967, East York was expanded to include the Town of Leaside. Since the 1998 amalgamation, it is administered together with old Toronto, and separate from Scarborough, North York, and Etobicoke-York, by the \"Toronto and East York Neighbourhood Council\".\n{{Col-start}}\n\nEast York itself is commonly divided into two zones with mainly Edwardian urban neighbourhoods situated south of [[Taylor-Massey Creek]] and referred to as [[Old East York]].\n\n{{Col-break}}\n'''Old East York'''\n* [[Old East York|Broadview North]]\n* [[Crescent Town]]\n* [[East Danforth]]\n* [[Pape Village]]\n* [[Woodbine Heights]]\n\n{{Col-break}}\n'''Suburban East York'''\n* [[Bermondsey, Toronto|Bermondsey]]\n* [[Governor's Bridge, Toronto|Governor's Bridge]]\n* [[Leaside]]\n* [[O'Connor\u2013Parkview]]\n* [[Thorncliffe Park]]\n{{Col-break}}\n[[File:East York Bungalows.JPG|thumb|right|Bungalows in [[Old East York]]]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===[[Etobicoke]]===\nEtobicoke is on the west side of the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]].

A number of neighbourhood maps of Toronto do exist, some produced by real estate firms and some by Internet portals. A project to map the neighbourhoods according to the common usage of the residents was done by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' broadsheet newspaper. Based on feedback from ''Star'' readers, it has produced a comprehensive, albeit informal, neighbourhood map.\n\n==Multiple listing service districts and neighbourhoods==\nAfter the update of Toronto [[Multiple listing service]] (MLS) on July 5, 2011, the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) introduced a new search feature for the Toronto MLS, used by [[Real estate broker|real estate agents]] operating in the region. MLS searches can be refined at three levels and MLS users can search houses by area, then by [[municipality]], and then by neighbourhood or community. As with the other MLS services for other jurisdictions, it used [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing Maps]] for its web mapping features until 2018, when it switched to [[Google Maps]]. These feature changes were the first change of this magnitude in about 50 years of Toronto MLS history.<ref name=\"JS_TREB_MLS_article\">[http://jamiesarner.com/toronto-real-estate/2011/07/new-zoning-toronto-mls-neighbourhoods-municipalities/ New Zoning in Toronto MLS Brings Neighbourhood Names and Municipalities] by Jamie Sarner, accessed on July 5, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe change was designed to eliminate the obsolete coding systems whereby [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto]] was divided into 86 artificial districts denominated by [[alphanumeric]] codes. Due to the growing population in the city and the increasing difficulty of browsing the code-based system, the TREB made a radical change, which is intended to simplify the use of MLS for real estate agents and home buyers.<ref name=\"ILT_TREB_MLS_article\">[http://ilovetoronto.com/toronto-real-estate/2011/07/mls-zoning-change-treb-community-names MLS Zoning Change: TREB Introducing Friendly Community Names] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711032508/http://ilovetoronto.com/toronto-real-estate/2011/07/mls-zoning-change-treb-community-names |date=2011-07-11 }} by ILoveToronto.com, accessed on July 5, 2011.</ref>\n\nBecause Toronto is a populous municipality of its own, the core city area will continue to be split into coded districts, although each of the districts will in turn contain neighbourhoods.

He played in critical debuts in New York City: the 1919 premier of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] ''Abraham Lincoln'' and the lead role of Brutus Jones in the 1920 premiere of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'', also touring with the play. In 1920, he was the first black American to receive [[The Drama League]]'s annual award as one of the 10 people who had done the most that year for American theatre.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGilpin was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], to Peter Gilpin (a factory worker) and Caroline White (a nurse)<ref> \"Charles Gilpin Buried After Simple Services in Trenton Baptist Church.\" ''Amsterdam (NY) News'', May 14, 1930, p. 1.</ref>; he attended St. Francis RC School in that city.<ref>''Who Was Who in the Theatre: 1912\u20131976'' vol. 2 D\u2013H, p. 942; originally published annually by John Parker, 1976 edition compiled by Gale Research Co. from Parker's older editions</ref> He started work as an apprentice in the ''[[Richmond Planet]]'' print shop before finding his career in theater. He first performed on stage as a singer at the age of 12. Prior to becoming a stage actor full-time, he worked as a printer and a pressman at several black newspapers during the late 1880s and into the 1890s, while getting some part-time work in vaudeville.  He married Florence Howard in 1897, and they had one son.<ref> \"Charles Gilpin Buried After Simple Services in Trenton Baptist Church.\" ''Amsterdam (NY) News'', May 14, 1930, p. 1.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Gilpin-The-Emperor-Jones-1920.jpg|thumb|Charles S. Gilpin in ''The Emperor Jones'' (1920)]]\nIn 1896 at the age of 18, Gilpin joined a [[minstrel show]], leaving Richmond and beginning a life on the road that lasted for many years. When between performances on stage, like many performers, he worked odd jobs to earn money: as a [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], [[barber]], boxing trainer, and railroad [[Porter (railroad)|porter]]. In 1903, he joined [[Hamilton, Ontario]]'s Canadian [[Jubilee Singers]].\n\nIn 1905, he started performing with traveling musical troupes of the [[Red Cross]] and the Candy Shop of America. He also played his first dramatic roles and honed his character acting in Chicago. He performed with [[Robert Mott]]'s [[Pekin Theater]] in Chicago for four years until 1911. Soon after, he toured the United States with the [[Pan-American Octetts]]. Gilpin worked with [[Rogers and Creamer]]'s [[Old Man's Boy Company]] in New York. In 1915, Gilpin joined the [[Anita Bush|Anita Bush Players]] as they moved from the [[Lincoln Theatre (Harlem)|Lincoln Theater]] in [[Harlem]] to the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]]. As New York theater was expanding, this was a time when the theatrical careers of many famous black actors were launched.\n\nIn 1916, Gilpin made a memorable appearance in whiteface as [[Jacob McCloskey]], a slave owner and villain of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''The Octoroon''. Though Gilpin left Bush's company over a salary dispute, his reputation allowed him to get the role of Rev. William Curtis in the 1919 premier of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] ''Abraham Lincoln''.\n\nGilpin's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut led to his being cast in the premier of [[Eugene O'Neill|Eugene O\u2019Neill's]] ''[[The Emperor Jones]]''. He played the lead role of Brutus Jones to great critical acclaim, including a lauded review by writer [[Hubert Harrison]] in ''[[Negro World]]''. Gilpin's achievement resulted in [[The Drama League]]'s naming him as one of the 10 people in 1920 who had done the most for American theater.<ref>{{cite news | title = Drama League Votes to Honor Gilpin; 'Emperor Jones' Star Is Included Among Those to Be Guests at Annual Dinner | date = February 21, 1921 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/03/06/103554323.pdf | work = The New York Times | accessdate = December 8, 2011}}; cf.

Gilpin wanted O'Neill to remove the word \"nigger\", which occurred frequently in the play.

He gave readings from \"The Emperor Jones\" over greater Boston station [[WGI (radio station)|WGI]], from their Medford Hillside studios.<ref>\"Bits from the Emperor Jones Broadcasted.\" ''Boston Herald'', April 4, 1922, p. 11.</ref>\n\nAfter the extended controversy and the disappointment of losing his signature role, Gilpin started drinking heavily. He never again performed on Broadway.  He died in 1930 in [[Eldridge Park, New Jersey]], his career in shambles. He was buried in an unmarked grave in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], his funeral arranged by friends shortly after his death.\n\nIn 1991, 61 years after his death, Gilpin was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/06/theater/on-stage-and-off.html|title=On Stage, and Off|work=The New York Times|date=December 6, 1991}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Eugene O'Neill==\n{{POV section|date=November 2016}}\nO\u2019Neill had major influence on African American actors, in particular Charles Gilpin and [[Paul Leroy Robeson]].

Robeson, however, did not originate the lead role in O\u2019Neill's ''[[The Emperor Jones]]''.

He played in critical debuts in New York City: the 1919 premier of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] ''Abraham Lincoln'' and the lead role of Brutus Jones in the 1920 premier of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'', also touring with the play. In 1920, he was the first black American to receive [[The Drama League]]'s annual award as one of the 10 people who had done the most that year for American theatre.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGilpin was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], to Peter Gilpin (a factory worker) and Caroline White (a nurse)<ref> \"Charles Gilpin Buried After Simple Services in Trenton Baptist Church.\" ''Amsterdam (NY) News'', May 14, 1930, p. 1.</ref>; he attended St. Francis RC School in that city.<ref>''Who Was Who in the Theatre: 1912\u20131976'' vol. 2 D\u2013H, p. 942; originally published annually by John Parker, 1976 edition compiled by Gale Research Co. from Parker's older editions</ref> He started work as an apprentice in the ''[[Richmond Planet]]'' print shop before finding his career in theater. He first performed on stage as a singer at the age of 12. Prior to becoming a stage actor full-time, he worked as a printer and a pressman at several black newspapers during the late 1880s and into the 1890s, while getting some part-time work in vaudeville.  He married Florence Howard in 1897, and they had one son.<ref> \"Charles Gilpin Buried After Simple Services in Trenton Baptist Church.\" ''Amsterdam (NY) News'', May 14, 1930, p. 1.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Gilpin-The-Emperor-Jones-1920.jpg|thumb|Charles S. Gilpin in ''The Emperor Jones'' (1920)]]\nIn 1896 at the age of 18, Gilpin joined a [[minstrel show]], leaving Richmond and beginning a life on the road that lasted for many years. When between performances on stage, like many performers, he worked odd jobs to earn money: as a [[Printer (publisher)|printer]], [[barber]], boxing trainer, and railroad [[Porter (railroad)|porter]]. In 1903, he joined [[Hamilton, Ontario]]'s Canadian [[Jubilee Singers]].\n\nIn 1905, he started performing with traveling musical troupes of the [[Red Cross]] and the Candy Shop of America. He also played his first dramatic roles and honed his character acting in Chicago. He performed with [[Robert Mott]]'s [[Pekin Theater]] in Chicago for four years until 1911. Soon after, he toured the United States with the [[Pan-American Octetts]]. Gilpin worked with [[Rogers and Creamer]]'s [[Old Man's Boy Company]] in New York. In 1915, Gilpin joined the [[Anita Bush|Anita Bush Players]] as they moved from the [[Lincoln Theatre (Harlem)|Lincoln Theater]] in [[Harlem]] to the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]]. As New York theater was expanding, this was a time when the theatrical careers of many famous black actors were launched.\n\nIn 1916, Gilpin made a memorable appearance in whiteface as [[Jacob McCloskey]], a slave owner and villain of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''The Octoroon''. Though Gilpin left Bush's company over a salary dispute, his reputation allowed him to get the role of Rev. William Curtis in the 1919 premier of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] ''Abraham Lincoln''.\n\nGilpin's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut led to his being cast in the premier of [[Eugene O'Neill|Eugene O\u2019Neill's]] ''[[The Emperor Jones]]''. He played the lead role of Brutus Jones to great critical acclaim, including a lauded review by writer [[Hubert Harrison]] in ''[[Negro World]]''. Gilpin's achievement resulted in [[The Drama League]]'s naming him as one of the 10 people in 1920 who had done the most for American theater.<ref>{{cite news | title = Drama League Votes to Honor Gilpin; 'Emperor Jones' Star Is Included Among Those to Be Guests at Annual Dinner | date = February 21, 1921 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/03/06/103554323.pdf | work = The New York Times | accessdate = December 8, 2011}}; cf.

Gilpin wanted O'Neill to remove the word \"nigger\", which occurred frequently in the play.

He gave readings from \"The Emperor Jones\" over greater Boston station [[WGI (radio station)|WGI]], from their Medford Hillside studios.<ref>\"Bits from the Emperor Jones Broadcasted.\" ''Boston Herald'', April 4, 1922, p. 11.</ref>\n\nAfter the extended controversy and the disappointment of losing his signature role, Gilpin started drinking heavily. He never again performed on Broadway.  He died in 1930 in [[Eldridge Park, New Jersey]], his career in shambles. He was buried in an unmarked grave in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], his funeral arranged by friends shortly after his death.\n\nIn 1991, 61 years after his death, Gilpin was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/06/theater/on-stage-and-off.html|title=On Stage, and Off|work=The New York Times|date=December 6, 1991}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Eugene O'Neill==\n{{POV section|date=November 2016}}\nO\u2019Neill had major influence on African American actors, in particular Charles Gilpin and [[Paul Leroy Robeson]].

Robeson, however, did not originate the lead role in O\u2019Neill's ''[[The Emperor Jones]]''.  Charles Sidney Gilpin, a respected leading man from the all-black Lafayette Players of Harlem, was the first actor to play the role of Brutus Jones when it was first staged on November 1, 1920, by the Provincetown Players at the Playwright's Theater in New York City.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Eugene O'Neill and the American Critic: A Bibliographical Checklist|last=Miller|first=Jordan Y.|publisher=Archon Books|year=1973|isbn=0208009396|location=Hamden, Conn.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/eugeneoneillamer0000mill/page/51 51\u201352]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/eugeneoneillamer0000mill/page/51}}</ref>  This production was O'Neill's first real smash hit.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eugene O'Neill|last=Clark|first=Barrett H.|publisher=Robert M.
