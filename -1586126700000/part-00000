London Authority]], that scrutinises the activities of the [[Mayor of London]] and has the power, with a two-thirds super-majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/229 |title=Localism Act 2011 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2015-04-03}}</ref> The London Assembly was established in 2000 and meets at [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], close to [[Tower Bridge]]. The Assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners ([[Transport for London|transport]], environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.\n\n==Assembly Members==\nThe Assembly comprises 25 Assembly Members elected using the [[Additional Member System]] of [[proportional representation]], with 13 seats needed for a majority. Elections take place every four years \u2013 at the same time as for the [[Mayor of London|Mayor]]. There are 14 geographical super-constituencies each electing one Member, with a further 11 members elected from a party list to make the total Assembly Members from each party proportional to the votes cast for that party across the whole of London using a modified [[D'Hondt method|D'Hondt]] allocation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17769428 |title=BBC News \u2013 How the London election works |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> A party must win at least 5% of the party list vote in order to win any seats. Members of the London Assembly have the [[post-nominal title]] 'AM', as do Members of the [[Welsh Assembly]]. The annual salary for a London Assembly Member is approximately \u00a355,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/london_assembly_members.jsp |title=London Assembly Members |work=The London Assembly |publisher=Mayor of London, the London Assembly and the Greater London Authority |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515185946/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/london_assembly_members.jsp |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Former Assembly Members===\nSince its creation in 2000, thirteen Assembly Members have subsequently been elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]: [[David Lammy]], [[Meg Hillier]] and [[Diana Johnson]] for Labour; [[Andrew Pelling]], [[Bob Neill]], [[Angie Bray]], [[Bob Blackman (politician)|Bob Blackman]], [[Eric Ollerenshaw]], [[Victoria Borwick]], [[James Cleverly]], [[Kit Malthouse]] and [[Kemi Badenoch]] for the Conservatives; and [[Lynne Featherstone]] for the Liberal Democrats. One Assembly Member, [[Jenny Jones, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb|Jenny Jones]], was appointed to the House of Lords as the first life peer for the Green Party, and simultaneously sat in the Assembly until May 2016. [[Sally Hamwee, Baroness Hamwee|Sally Hamwee]], [[Graham Tope, Baron Tope|Graham Tope]] and [[Toby Harris, Baron Harris of Haringey|Toby Harris]] were life peers elected to the assembly, while [[Lynne Featherstone]] and [[Dee Doocey]] were appointed peers after leaving the Assembly. In addition, [[Val Shawcross]], Assembly Member for [[Lambeth and Southwark (London Assembly constituency)|Lambeth and Southwark]] was selected, but unsuccessful, as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the constituency of [[Bermondsey and Old Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey and Old Southwark]] at the 2010 general election, as was [[Navin Shah]] who stood for Labour in [[Harrow East]] in 2017. [[Andrew Dismore]], [[Graham Tope]], and [[Richard Tracey]] are all former MPs who were later elected to the Assembly. One Assembly Member \u2013 [[John Biggs (politician)|John Biggs]], former AM for [[City and East (London Assembly constituency)|City and East]] \u2013 became the directly-elected [[Mayor of Tower Hamlets]] in 2015.

They scored over 40 goals between them in their first season together and were considered to be Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, [[Georgios Samaras]] was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/celtic/268099-gary-hooper-wants-to-maintain-strike-partnership/ |title=Gary Hooper wants to maintain strike partnership |publisher=STV Sport |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role.

They scored over 40 goals between them in their first season together and were considered to be Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, [[Georgios Samaras]] was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/celtic/268099-gary-hooper-wants-to-maintain-strike-partnership/ |title=Gary Hooper wants to maintain strike partnership |publisher=STV Sport |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role.

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925-1931. From 1934-1941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]].

In many instances, these community-based defense organizations paid informants to infiltrate these groups and report on what they discovered. The longest-lived and most effective of these American Jewish resistance organizations was the Los Angeles Jewish Community Committee (LAJCC), which was backed financially by the Jewish leaders of the motion picture industry. The day-to-day operations of the LAJCC were supervised by a Jewish attorney, [[Leon L. Lewis]]. Lewis was uniquely qualified to combat the rise of Nazism in Los Angeles, having served as the first national secretary of the Anti-Defamation League in Chicago from 1925-1931. From 1934-1941, the LAJCC maintained its undercover surveillance of the German-American Bund, the Silver Shirts and dozens of other pro-Nazi, nativist groups that operated in Los Angeles. Partnering with the American Legion in Los Angeles, the LAJCC channeled eyewitness accounts of sedition onto federal authorities. Working with the ADL, Leon Lewis and the LAJCC played a strategic role in counseling the McCormack-Dickstein Committee investigation of Nazi propaganda activities in the United States (1934) and the Dies Committee investigation of \"un-American activities\" (1938-1940). In their final reports to Congress, both Committees found that the sudden rise in political antisemitism in the United States during the decade was due, in part, to the German government's support of these domestic groups.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Laura|url=https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855179/|title=Hollywood's Spies: The Undercover Surveillance of Nazis in Los Angeles|date=2017|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781479855179|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Steven|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/hitler-in-los-angeles-9781620405642/|title=Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America|date=2017|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781620405642|location=New York|page=|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, ADL has partnered with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) field offices, sharing information learned from monitoring of extremist groups.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA167 \"Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA\"], George Michael.

For the ADL to justify its newly adopted statement because the word genocide did not exist at the time indicates a halfhearted attempt to placate Armenians while not offending Turkey.

Upon the involvement of ADL, the petty quarreling of next door neighbors, initially about garden plants and pets, quickly escalated into both civil and criminal court cases involving charges of anti-Semitism, and counter charges of defamation.\n\nCandace and Mitchell Aronson, Jewish next door neighbors of William and Dorothy Quigley, used a [[Radio Shack]] police scanner to listen in on the cordless telephone conversations of Mr. and Mrs. Quigley. When the Aronsons heard the Quigleys discuss a campaign to drive them from the neighborhood with \"Nazi scare tactics,\" the Aronsons contacted the Denver office of ADL. Upon the advice of ADL, the Aronsons then recorded the Quigley's private telephone conversations. The conversations included discussions of putting pictures of oven doors on the Aronsons' home (a reference to the Holocaust), burning one of the Aronson children, and wishing that the Aronsons had been killed in a suicide bombing. (The Quigleys later indicated that these remarks were not anti-Semitic, and were only intended to be sick humor.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13674/edition_id/264/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Jewish News Weekly|publisher=}}</ref> Neither the Aronsons nor ADL were aware that Congress had amended federal wiretap law which made it illegal to record conversations from a cordless telephone, to transcribe the material, and to use the transcriptions for any purpose.\n\nNot knowing about the new federal law, the Aronsons used the tapes as the basis for a federal civil lawsuit against the Quigleys in December 1994. A day later, Saul Rosenthal, Regional Director of ADL, appeared at a news conference with the Aronsons in which he described their encounter with the Quigleys as \"a vicious anti-Semitic campaign,\" based solely on conversations he and associates had with the Aronsons. Later that day, Mr. Rosenthal expanded on his remarks in an interview on a Denver radio talk show.\n\nTwo days later, Jefferson County prosecutors used the tapes as the basis for filing criminal charges against the Quigleys.\n\nThe Quigleys became the target of scorn and ridicule. They received threats, and were forced to hire security guards for their home. A package of dog feces was mailed to their house. When they attended church, their priest openly chastised them in his sermon. The family was forced to shop in other towns, to avoid being recognized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quigley v.

The Quigleys maintained their action against ADL and Rosenthal, which was heard in federal court. A federal jury returned a verdict of $10 million in favor of the Quigleys. ADL appealed.\n\nAccording to an April 13, 2001, article in ''[[The Forward]]'', upon hearing the appeal, a federal judge \"lambasted the ADL for labeling a nasty neighborhood feud as an anti-Semitic event\" and upheld most of Quigley's $10 million [[lawsuit]] for [[slander and libel|defamation]].

('''\u03a9\u03a6\u03a7''') is a national [[multicultural]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|sorority]] that was established on November 9, 1988 at [[Rutgers\u2013New Brunswick|Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] by eight women of [[Asian people|Asian]], [[African American]], and [[Latinas|Latina]] descent.\n\n== History ==\nThe founders of Omega Phi Chi were a group of eight women who felt the need to establish a multicultural organization on the campus of [[Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick|Rutgers University - New Brunswick]] that spoke to their needs across diverse backgrounds, distinct cultural roots, and the empowerment of the female culture. They came together to found a multicultural sorority; a different type of organization that would not be categorized by [[ethnicity]], [[creed]] or [[culture]]. Since its inception, it has grown to include over 95 different nationalities and has started 24 chapters in New Jersey, New York, Florida, Arizona, Texas, Indiana, and California.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n'''Founding Mothers'''\n\nThe founding mothers of Omega Phi Chi Multicultural Sorority Inc. are:\n\n* Bernadette Santana - Filipina & Dominican\n* Dawn Gonzalez - Puerto Rican\n* Cindy Cumba - Puerto Rican & Mexican\n* Stacy Richardson - African American\n* Annette Cuevas - Puerto Rican\n* Socorro Valle - Puerto Rican\n* Tracie Davis - African American\n* Magdaly Casillas - Puerto Rican\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe purpose of Omega Phi Chi is to create a unity among all women and promote ethnic diversity by integrating women of all boundaries and cultures. Omega Phi Chi's concept of sisterhood are love, honesty, loyalty, responsibility of one another, and mutual respect. The main objectives of this organization are academic excellence and involvement in community affairs. In addition, Omega Phi Chi prides themselves in promoting professionalism. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Facts ==\n*Colors: Perfect Pink and Onyx Black\n*Mascot: Black Panther\n*Flower: Lady's Pink Slipper known as Moccasin\n*Stone: Black Onyx\n*Core Values: Academic Excellence and Involvement in Community Affairs\n*We Step and We Stroll\n\nMottos:\n\"Destroying All Boundaries.

It has thus far only been found in [[Australia]]. It mates on [[Polypore|bracket fungi]], preferentially those with a lighter-colored surface in order to enhance mating displays. In addition to these physical displays, flies emit specific sounds in order to attract and ultimately copulate with females.\n\nIn a laboratory, the fly's life cycle spans 17 days. It is one of three Australian species reported to court and mate using a [[Lek mating|lekking]] system. However, there is some controversy on whether or not the fly is a true lekking species.\n\n== Description ==\n''H. mycetophaga'' has a mean length from its head to the tip of its wing of 4.0&nbsp;mm for males, and 4.5&nbsp;mm for females.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fly's lifespan has yet to be recorded in the wild, but averaged 17 days in the laboratory.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fly is primarily located in Australian [[rainforest]]s, from eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to south-central [[Queensland]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Peter A.|date=1978-11-01|title=Habitat selection and evolutionary strategies in ''Drosophila'': An invited address|journal=Behavior Genetics|language=en|volume=8|issue=6|pages=511\u2013526|doi=10.1007/BF01067480|pmid=728026|issn=1573-3297}}</ref> It was first discovered by the [[Ourimbah Creek]] in [[New South Wales]], in 1924.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P6i9CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA133|title=Drosophilidae (Diptera)|last=Brake|first=Irina|last2=Baechli|first2=Gerhard|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004261037|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Habitat ==\n''Hirtodrosophila mycetophaga'' typically prefers habitats that are naturally wet and humid, as the fly is very susceptible to [[desiccation]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Crossley|first=Seth A.|date=1988|title=Lek behavior and its evolution in ''Drosophila mycetophaga'' (''Hirtodrosophila'') |url=http://www.ou.edu/journals/dis/DIS67/DIS67.pdf |journal=Drosophila Information Service|volume=67 |pages=17\u201319 |via=University of Oklahoma}}</ref> This is especially true for flies that are newly emerged; if the fly does not receive fresh food within a day of emergence, it will dehydrate rapidly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Bracket fungus Columba Falls Pyengana Tasmania Australia.jpeg|thumb|[[Polypore|Bracket fungus]] found in Columba Falls, Pyengana Tasmania '''\u00a0''']]\nThe fly's courtship and mating territory is the horizontal underside of the [[Polypore|bracket fungus]], ''[[Ganoderma applanatum]].'' These fungi are often found growing out of the side of fallen trees and are plentiful in the wet forest.<ref name=\":0\" /> This means that the fly typically has many opportunities to disperse throughout the forest.<ref name=\":0\" /> On an individual bracket fungus flies are spread relatively evenly. Some of these brackets will ripen and become covered in a white layer, interrupted by pores. The underside of the fungus varies in color depending on the developmental stage of the fungus itself.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, ''H. mycetophaga'' will only be found on the fungus if the fungus is white- or grey- colored.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Evolutionary Biology of Colonizing Species|date=1983|last1=Parsons|first1=Peter Angas|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511525742|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511525742}}</ref> This enhances the contrast between the fly and its surroundings and makes mating displays easier to see.<ref name=\":1\" /> Flies tend to choose brackets that are ripe and actively discharging spores.<ref name=\":0\" /> They also require some access to light and may be found in regions under which light is able to travel through the dense forest canopy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nResearchers have suggested that adult flies prefer to live on fresh mushrooms, while larvae prefer to occupy decaying fungi.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, flies use the bracket fungus to camouflage themselves.<ref name=\":0\" /> When a lek is observed from the side, it is more difficult to detect and is therefore less visible to predators, particularly terrestrial predators like spiders and lizards.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Home range and territoriality ==\nOnce a male ''H. mycetophaga'' comes to a lek, he typically remains in the same location throughout the day. Male patrolling displays include bobbing and holding wings apart.<ref name=\":0\" /> Males tend to occupy a particular region of a bracket fungus, but territories shift over time as males defend mobile zones, termed moving territories.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Shelly|first=Todd E|date=2018-05-29|title=Sexual Selection on Leks: A Fruit Fly Primer|journal=Journal of Insect Science|volume=18|issue=3 |page=9 |doi=10.1093/jisesa/iey048|issn=1536-2442|pmc=6007453|pmid=29850851}}</ref> Researchers found that nine out of ten flies reappeared from one day to the next, either to the same fungus or to a nearby one.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn courtship, females are more passive in that they move less on the fungus throughout the process. Males meanwhile move frequently, typically sideways.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, females do extend their wings to other flies in order to respond to courtship exchanges. Females will either accept the male's advances by voluntarily assuming a copulatory position or reject the advances by raising her abdomen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Access to female mates in leks ===\nWhen females visit the lek, they typically appear on the edges and stay for shorter periods of time than males do.<ref name=\":0\" /> Females are also outnumbered by males. Differential access to mates has been observed in males; certain males tend to dominate the edges where females first arrive, while others are relegated to inferior positions toward the center of the lek.<ref name=\":0\" /> The male closest to a newly arrived female approaches her and displays wing-scissoring behavior. In the event that other males attempt to copulate with the female, the original male will interrupt courtship to chase the other male away. These chases are usually brief and successful, with the original male being able to retain control of the female.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn leks, females tend to associate with larger male aggregations.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Isvaran|first=Kavita|last2=Ponkshe|first2=Aditya|date=2013-08-01|title=How general is a female mating preference for clustered males in lekking species?

Females do not occupy larger bracket fungi in response to the area itself, but the fact that more males are present on them.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Male defense of resources ===\nIn addition, researchers believe that the presence of optimal breeding sites or specific resources for females does not dictate where aggregations were formed.<ref name=\":2\" /> Aggregations were observed in areas without resources, and fungi with ample resources were not used more often than those without resources.<ref name=\":2\" /> Males were even more evenly distributed than would be expected through a random distribution. This provides evidence that males intentionally stay away from each other, and this dispersion pattern (as well as the female dispersion) provides evidence for the lek mating system.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is unknown if other environmental factors may influence which specific sites ''H. mycetophaga'' utilizes.\n\n== Food resources ==\nMany, but not all, ''H. mycetophaga'' feed on fungi.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/entomologywiths00folsgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/entomologywiths00folsgoog/page/n386 373]|title=Entomology, with Special Reference to Its Ecological Aspects|last=Folsom|first=Justus Watson|date=1922|publisher=P.

The [[ideal free distribution]] has been tested with leks, and rejected as each male does ''not'' have an equal opportunity to mate.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females prefer males in aggregations, as opposed to solitary males, and also do not choose equally within an aggregation.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females are more likely to mate if the lek contains over five individuals; therefore, the optimal size for a lek is in between five and 20 males.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nLeks may have evolved away from the source of food because sexual displays would not be easily visible in the poorly-lit forest.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fact that flies tend to aggregate only on fungi with lighter backgrounds, increasing the visibility of displays, is further evidence for this theory; visibility also accounts for the wing display behavior observed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Visual stimulation seems to dominate leks, though olfactory stimulation through [[pheromone]]s may be involved as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''H. mycetophaga'' is one of few species of ''[[Hirtodrosophila]]'' that exhibits lek mating.<ref name=\":6\" /> There is a Hawaiian lekking species that is closely related, belonging to the subgenus ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The presence of lekking in these related species may have resulted from [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' however, leks occur on the smooth surface of a fern leaf instead of the underside of a bracket fungus.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Female-initiated vs. male-initiated models ====\nFemale-initiated models of lekking suggest that male aggregations are primarily shaped by [[Mate choice|female mate choice]]. On the other hand, male-initiated models suggest that female choice does not actively influence male dispersion or settlement patterns.<ref name=\":6\" /> If the female-dominant model is supported, number of females (along with average male mating success) should increase with the size of the male aggregation. Meanwhile, if the male-initiated model is supported, then the distribution of males should be proportional to the number of females present.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, male-initiated leks fall in line with the ideal free distribution model and the theory has therefore been rejected. Consequently, leks are more likely female-initiated.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Hotspot model ====\nThe hotspot model is one of many that have been proposed to explain lek mating. This male-initiated model suggests that male aggregations are concentrated based on areas of high female presence.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, this model may not fully account for the behavior seen in ''H. mycetophaga''.<ref name=\":6\" /> Previous observations have shown that the presence of [[exudate]]s (fluid emerging from the inside of an organism through some sort of opening), which would attract females, does not influence where displays occur.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Therefore, this model cannot fully account for lek mating in the species. It is possible that the distribution of certain resources may influence initial clumping.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Costs of displaying in groups ====\nThough large aggregations of males are generally more successful, there may be costs of joining that would prevent males from joining. As group size increases, there may be increasingly antagonistic interactions between males.<ref name=\":6\" /> Those males that are not dominant within the group may suffer more from these conflicts, outweighing the benefits of joining the lek. These males may be forced off of display sites.<ref name=\":6\" /> Even though these males are not necessarily significantly smaller than the others, there may be other factors that make them subordinate compared to other males and unable to defend their territory such as age or previous conflict history.<ref name=\":6\" /> The interference model may more accurately explain behavior in this species, as evidence of aggressive encounters within the lek has been found.<ref name=\":6\" /> Poor males are forced onto smaller leks. The most competitive males are found at the best sites on the lek. These males are attractive to females because they provide genetic benefits which will be passed on to the offspring.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Controversy in mating hypotheses ==\nLeks have previously been used to explain how species avoid predation risks associated with displaying at these aggregation sites. However, the idea that lek mating is present in ''H. mycetophaga'' has been contested.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UoABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Leks|last=H\u00f6glund|first=Jacob|last2=Alatalo|first2=Rauno V.|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400864157|language=en}}</ref> One study suggests instead that the flies simply use the bracket fungi as a breeding and food source.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe authors of this paper confirm that collections of flies are present in male aggregations on the white areas of bracket fungi.

Males are aggregating around resources, which goes against the definition of lekking, in which males gather in an area with little to no resources to breed and no feeding or egg-laying goes on there.<ref name=\":8\" /> The authors contest that leks should not be used for feeding or breeding, and provide females with no resources apart from the male. Males should not compete for resources that females seek, and arriving females should choose among males based on courtship alone.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Social behavior ==\n''H. mycetophaga'' are considered non-social insects, excepting the grouping inherent in their lekking behavior.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Prokopy|first=Ronald|date=2001|title=Joining and avoidance behavior in nonsocial insects |url=http://www.programamoscamed.mx/EIS/biblioteca/libros/articulos/Propkopy%20and%20Roitberg_2001_2%20.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=46|pages=645|via=|doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.46.1.631}}</ref> Despite this, groups of two or more adults have been observed to form at different sites.

The [[ideal free distribution]] has been tested with leks, and rejected as each male does ''not'' have an equal opportunity to mate.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females prefer males in aggregations, as opposed to solitary males, and also do not choose equally within an aggregation.<ref name=\":6\" /> Females are more likely to mate if the lek contains over five individuals; therefore, the optimal size for a lek is in between five and 20 males.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nLeks may have evolved away from the source of food because sexual displays would not be easily visible in the poorly-lit forest.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fact that flies tend to aggregate only on fungi with lighter backgrounds, increasing the visibility of displays, is further evidence for this theory; visibility also accounts for the wing display behavior observed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Visual stimulation seems to dominate leks, though olfactory stimulation through [[pheromone]]s may be involved as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''H. mycetophaga'' is one of few species of ''[[Hirtodrosophila]]'' that exhibits lek mating.<ref name=\":6\" /> There is a Hawaiian lekking species that is closely related, belonging to the subgenus ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The presence of lekking in these related species may have resulted from [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In the Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' however, leks occur on the smooth surface of a fern leaf instead of the underside of a bracket fungus.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Female-initiated vs. male-initiated models ====\nFemale-initiated models of lekking suggest that male aggregations are primarily shaped by [[Mate choice|female mate choice]]. On the other hand, male-initiated models suggest that female choice does not actively influence male dispersion or settlement patterns.<ref name=\":6\" /> If the female-dominant model is supported, number of females (along with average male mating success) should increase with the size of the male aggregation. Meanwhile, if the male-initiated model is supported, then the distribution of males should be proportional to the number of females present.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, male-initiated leks fall in line with the ideal free distribution model and the theory has therefore been rejected. Consequently, leks are more likely female-initiated.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Hotspot model ====\nThe hotspot model is one of many that have been proposed to explain lek mating. This male-initiated model suggests that male aggregations are concentrated based on areas of high female presence.<ref name=\":6\" /> However, this model may not fully account for the behavior seen in ''H. mycetophaga''.<ref name=\":6\" /> Previous observations have shown that the presence of [[exudate]]s (fluid emerging from the inside of an organism through some sort of opening), which would attract females, does not influence where displays occur.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> Therefore, this model cannot fully account for lek mating in the species. It is possible that the distribution of certain resources may influence initial clumping.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Costs of displaying in groups ====\nThough large aggregations of males are generally more successful, there may be costs of joining that would prevent males from joining. As group size increases, there may be increasingly antagonistic interactions between males.<ref name=\":6\" /> Those males that are not dominant within the group may suffer more from these conflicts, outweighing the benefits of joining the lek. These males may be forced off of display sites.<ref name=\":6\" /> Even though these males are not necessarily significantly smaller than the others, there may be other factors that make them subordinate compared to other males and unable to defend their territory such as age or previous conflict history.<ref name=\":6\" /> The interference model may more accurately explain behavior in this species, as evidence of aggressive encounters within the lek has been found.<ref name=\":6\" /> Poor males are forced onto smaller leks. The most competitive males are found at the best sites on the lek. These males are attractive to females because they provide genetic benefits which will be passed on to the offspring.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Controversy in mating hypotheses ==\nLeks have previously been used to explain how species avoid predation risks associated with displaying at these aggregation sites. However, the idea that lek mating is present in ''H. mycetophaga'' has been contested.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UoABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|title=Leks|last=H\u00f6glund|first=Jacob|last2=Alatalo|first2=Rauno V.|date=2014-07-14|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400864157|language=en}}</ref> One study suggests instead that the flies simply use the bracket fungi as a breeding and food source.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe authors of this paper confirm that collections of flies are present in male aggregations on the white areas of bracket fungi. However, females tend to aggregate around exudates (resulting from the [[Tineidae|tineid moth]] larvae's damage). In fact, females were rarely found on fungi without exudate.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=A. A.|last2=Blows|first2=M.

Therefore, male competition plays a larger part in male distribution than female choice does.<ref name=\":8\" /> According to this hypothesis, larger fungi would be preferred as they provide larger display areas and more exudate for feeding and breeding.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe authors suggest that this challenges the idea of a lek by definition. Males are aggregating around resources, which goes against the definition of lekking, in which males gather in an area with little to no resources to breed and no feeding or egg-laying goes on there.<ref name=\":8\" /> The authors contest that leks should not be used for feeding or breeding, and provide females with no resources apart from the male. Males should not compete for resources that females seek, and arriving females should choose among males based on courtship alone.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Social behavior ==\n''H. mycetophaga'' are considered non-social insects, excepting the grouping inherent in their lekking behavior.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Prokopy|first=Ronald|date=2001|title=Joining and avoidance behavior in nonsocial insects |url=http://www.programamoscamed.mx/EIS/biblioteca/libros/articulos/Propkopy%20and%20Roitberg_2001_2%20.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=46|pages=645|via=}}</ref> Despite this, groups of two or more adults have been observed to form at different sites. However, other adults of the same species have been observed to avoid joining such groups.<ref name=\":12\" /> Flies intentionally space themselves as well as their progeny out from other flies.<ref name=\":12\" /> Only about 6% of males were seen outside leks, demonstrating a clear benefit to grouping; grouped males have a greater [[per capita]] probability of encountering receptive females than do isolated males.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> As many as 70 males of ''H. mycetophaga'' have been observed on a single bracket fungus at one time.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n== Conservation ==\nThough not necessarily specific to ''H. mycetophaga'', the species has been included in general reports that ''Drosophila'' can be used as a biological indicator of the health of an ecosystem or environment, particularly in recent times of [[climate change]].<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Peter A.|date=1991|title=Biodiversity conservation under global climatic change: the insect ''Drosophila'' as a biological indicator?|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters|volume=1|issue=3|pages=77\u201383|doi=10.2307/2997493|issn=0960-7447|jstor=2997493}}</ref> Studies indicate that extinctions and re-appearances of rare rain forest species, like ''H. mycetophaga'', follow increases under periods of environmental stress.<ref name=\":9\" /> Overall, this can be used to assess the impact on biodiversity.

Others, known as ''tunnelers'', bury the dung wherever they find it. A third group, the ''dwellers'', neither roll nor burrow: they simply live in manure. They are often attracted by the dung collected by [[burrowing owl]]s. There are dung beetle species of different colours and sizes, and some functional traits such as body mass (or biomass) and leg length can have high levels of variability.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Hannah M.|last2=Louzada|first2=Julio|last3=Bardgett|first3=Richard D.|last4=Barlow|first4=Jos|date=2016-03-03|title=Assessing the Importance of Intraspecific Variability in Dung Beetle Functional Traits|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0145598|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0145598|pmid=26939121|pmc=4777568|issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1145598G}}</ref>\n\nAll the [[species]] belong to the superfamily [[Scarabaeoidea]], most of them to the subfamilies [[Scarabaeinae]] and [[Aphodiinae]] of the family [[Scarabaeidae]] (scarab beetles).

Some smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for the dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight.

The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the  ball, then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]].\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of [[Jean Henri Fabre]] in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fabre, J.

The derivative term ''xprw'' or ''\u1e2bpr(w)'' is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\n\nThe scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{quote|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 \"Isis and Osiris\"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and [[funerary art]].\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seals]]. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\n[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|left|A scarab, depicted on the walls of [[KV6|Tomb KV6]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]]]\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n{{quote|It may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"<ref>Andrews, Carol (1994). ''Amulets of Ancient Egypt''. Texas: University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-70464-X}}. p. 51.</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seals]] of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\n==In culture==\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used [[therapeutically]] (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow | first=V.B. |title=Therapeutic arthropods and other, largely terrestrial, folk-medicinally important invertebrates: a comparative survey and review. |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=January 2017| volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=9| doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0136-0| pmid=28173820 | pmc=5296966 }}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\nIn [[Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Eagle and the Beetle]]\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and places her latest eggs in [[Zeus]]'s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\n[[Aristophanes]] alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\n[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his [[Superiority complex|feeling of superiority]] to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king's horse wears golden shoes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Hans Christian|last2=James|first2=M.

Some smaller species simply attach themselves to the dung-providers to wait for the dung. After capturing the dung, a dung beetle rolls it, following a straight line despite all obstacles. Sometimes, dung beetles try to steal the dung ball from another beetle, so the dung beetles have to move rapidly away from a dung pile once they have rolled their ball to prevent it from being stolen. Dung beetles can roll up to 10 times their weight. Male ''Onthophagus taurus'' beetles can pull 1,141 times their own body weight: the equivalent of an average person pulling six double-decker buses full of people.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/24/dung-beetles | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Homa | last=Khaleeli | title=Just how strong is a dung beetle? | date=24 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Scarabaeus laticollis 2.jpg|thumb|left|Two dung beetles fighting over a ball of dung]]\n\nA species of dung beetle (the African ''Scarabaeus zambesianus'') [[animal navigation|navigates]] by [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] patterns in [[moonlight]],{{Sfn|Tills|2013|p=123}}  the first animal known to do so.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/424033a| pmid = 12840748| title = Animal behaviour: Insect orientation to polarized moonlight| journal = Nature| volume = 424| issue = 6944| page = 33| year = 2003| last1 = Dacke | first1 = M. | last2 = Nilsson | first2 = D.

The \"rollers\" roll and bury a dung ball either for food storage or for making a brooding ball. In the latter case, two beetles, one male and one female, stay around the dung ball during the rolling process. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, while the female hitch-hikes or simply follows behind. In some cases, the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the  ball, then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them prepares the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]].\n\nSome species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring. The dung beetle goes through a complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The larvae live in brood balls made with dung prepared by their parents. During the larval stage, the beetle feeds on the dung surrounding it.\n\nThe behavior of the beetles was poorly understood until the studies of [[Jean Henri Fabre]] in the late 19th century. For example, Fabre corrected the myth that a dung beetle would seek aid from other dung beetles when confronted by obstacles. By observation and experiment, he found the seeming helpers were in fact awaiting an opportunity to steal the roller's food source.<ref>{{cite book |author=Fabre, J.

The derivative term ''xprw'' or ''\u1e2bpr(w)'' is variously translated as \"form\", \"transformation\", \"happening\", \"mode of being\" or \"what has come into being\", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.\n\nThe scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] (\"he who has come into being\"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed that the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who creates himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{quote|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 \"Isis and Osiris\"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Egyptians believed that Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.\n\nThe image of the scarab, conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection, is ubiquitous in ancient Egyptian religious and [[funerary art]].\n\nExcavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seals]]. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.\n\n[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|left|A scarab, depicted on the walls of [[KV6|Tomb KV6]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]]]]\n\nThe scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such \"heart scarabs\" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the \"heart scarab\" was to ensure that the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the \"transformation spells\" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.\n\nOne scholar comments on other traits of the scarab connected with the theme of death and rebirth:\n{{quote|It may not have gone unnoticed that the pupa, whose wings and legs are encased at this stage of development, is very mummy-like. It has even been pointed out that the egg-bearing ball of dung is created in an underground chamber which is reached by a vertical shaft and horizontal passage curiously reminiscent of Old Kingdom mastaba tombs.\"<ref>Andrews, Carol (1994). ''Amulets of Ancient Egypt''. Texas: University of Texas Press. {{ISBN|0-292-70464-X}}. p. 51.</ref>}}\n\nIn contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seals]] of varying types. The best-known of these being Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (8 of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]].\n\nThe scarab remains an item of popular interest thanks to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue \"for luck\".\n\n==In culture==\nSome dung beetles are used as food in South East Asia and a variety of dung beetle species have been used [[therapeutically]] (and are still being used in traditionally living societies) in potions and folk medicines to treat a number of illnesses and disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer-Rochow | first=V.B. |title=Therapeutic arthropods and other, largely terrestrial, folk-medicinally important invertebrates: a comparative survey and review. |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine| date=January 2017| volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=9| doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0136-0| pmid=28173820 | pmc=5296966 }}</ref>\n\n===In literature===\nIn [[Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Eagle and the Beetle]]\", the eagle kills a hare that has asked for sanctuary with a beetle. The beetle then takes revenge by twice destroying the eagle's eggs. The eagle, in despair, flies up to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] and places her latest eggs in [[Zeus]]'s lap, beseeching the god to protect them. When the beetle finds out what the eagle has done, it stuffs itself with dung, goes straight up to Zeus and flies right into his face. Zeus is startled at the sight of the unpleasant creature, jumping to his feet so that the eggs are broken. Learning of the origin of their feud, Zeus attempts to mediate and, when his efforts to mediate fail, he changes the breeding season of the eagle to a time when the beetles are not above ground.\n\n[[Aristophanes]] alluded to Aesop's fable several times in his plays. In ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', the hero rides up to Olympus to free the goddess Peace from her prison. His steed is an enormous dung beetle which has been fed so much dung that it has grown to monstrous size.\n\n[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s \"The Dung Beetle\" tells the story of a dung beetle who lives in the stable of the king's horses in an imaginary kingdom. When he demands golden shoes like those the king's horse wears and is refused, he flies away and has a series of adventures, which are often precipitated by his [[Superiority complex|feeling of superiority]] to other animals. He finally returns to the stable having decided (against all logic) that it is for him that the king's horse wears golden shoes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Hans Christian|last2=James|first2=M.

The entire image is repeated within the computer monitor.\n}}\n\n'''''The Stanley Parable''''' is an [[interactive drama]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] designed by American developer Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).

However, Pugh also found that without some visual cues as to where divergent paths occurred, they would often miss these choices, and so added elements like colors to highlight that a choice was available at these points.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> In the original mod, one set of choices briefly takes the player to sections modeled after parts of ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. In the remake, Pugh and Wreden included one section where the player briefly revisits the opening of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and another where the player is dropped into a ''[[Minecraft]]'' world.

The entire image is repeated within the computer monitor.\n}}\n\n'''''The Stanley Parable''''' is an [[interactive drama]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] designed by American developer Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. Together with [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]], Wreden later released a stand-alone [[remake]] using the [[List of Source engine mods|Source engine]] under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake included new story elements and upgraded graphics. It was announced and approved via [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2012, and was released on October 17, 2013, for [[Microsoft Windows]]. Later updates to the game added support for [[OS X]] on December 19, 2013, and for [[Linux]] on September 9, 2015. A further expanded edition entitled '''''The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe''''' is scheduled for release in 2020. It will be available on consoles and include additional content.\n\nThe game has no combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the gameplay involves guiding a [[silent protagonist]] named Stanley alongside [[narration]] by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may disobey the narrator's suggestions, which will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game restarts. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways. Both the original mod and the remake have received critical praise from journalists. Critics praised the game's narrative and commentary on player choice and decision-making.\n\n== Gameplay and story ==\n[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The game begins in a mysteriously abandoned office.|alt=A brightly lit office space with tanish-brown flooring, egg-white walls, and square overhead lights. Several closed doors leading to personal offices and other rooms line the walls, as well as plants and other office-related objects. In the center of the room is a large filing cabinet.]]\n\nThe game is presented to the player from the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The player can move around and interact with certain elements of the environment, such as pressing buttons or opening doors, but has no other controls.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nThe story is primarily presented to the player by the narrator. He explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on a computer screen and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.<ref name=\"kotaku\" />\n\nAt this stage, the story splits off in numerous possibilities, based on the player's choices. When the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action. Doing so will force the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door.{{Efn|Technically speaking, the first choice in the game is choosing whether or not to lock Stanley's office door, in which locking it results in a unique ending, but the choice between the two doors is the first one that is obviously presented to the player.<ref name=\"endingtree\">{{Cite web|url=https://guardianlv.com/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-endings-guide-the-definitive-ending-tree/|title=The Stanley Parable Endings Guide: the Definitive Ending Tree|last=Fenner|first=James|date=2013-10-27|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>}} The player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which causes the narrator to adjust his story to get the player to return to the \"proper\" path.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The narrator also breaks the [[fourth wall]] on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.<ref name=\"wired\" /> A total of six possible endings exist in the original mod, and Wreden states it would take about an hour for the player to experience them all.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/08/the-stanley-parable/ | title = Brilliant Indie Game The Stanley Parable Will Mess With Your Head | first = Jason | last = Schreier | date =2011-08-16 | accessdate = 2013-01-03 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref> The remake adds in more than 10 additional endings, as well as several [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] and other choice-related gameplay aspects.<ref name=\"endingtree\" /> The ''Ultra Deluxe'' edition will expand on this further.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Development ==\n=== ''Half-Life 2'' mod ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Initially, I just wanted to make a game that was something I\u2019d never seen before.

Wreden used an audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra behind\" /> Brighting had provided his voice in a single pass.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings without spending an excessive amount of time replaying the game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as \"and then everything was happy!\", that would otherwise insult the player as a poor reward for completing a long game.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included, though some had to be dropped due to his inability to figure out how to work with them within the Source engine.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a \"broken\" puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration.<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project \"grueling\" and stifling his career ambition,<ref name=\"kotaku\" /> noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\nWreden initially tested the game with a friend before posting the mod to the website [[ModDB]], a few weeks prior to his graduation from college.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /><ref name=\"rps interview\"/> After graduating, Wreden had left for Australia with intent to open a video game-themed bar similar to the [[Mana Bar]], which he had worked at for about a year, but his future plans changed with success of the mod.<ref name=\"rps interview\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/03/28/davey-wreden-william-pugh-the-stanley-parable-interview/ | title = Davey Wreden & William Pugh: Life After The Stanley Parable | first = John | last = Walker | date= 2014-03-28 | accessdate = 2014-03-28 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Wreden had started to receive various offers from others to help work on new games as well as some job offers from larger developers which he turned down, as at the time it was \"not the kind of scene\" he wanted to work in.<ref name=\"shacknews\" /> Instead, he started to gather other independent programmers to work out an improved version of ''The Stanley Parable'' and leading towards a completely new title in the future.<ref name=\"shacknews\" />\n\n=== Remake ===\n[[File:Stanley parable screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|The \"Mind Control Facility\" in both the original mod (top) and remake (bottom).
