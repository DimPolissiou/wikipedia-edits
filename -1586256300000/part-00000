He is the founder and vice-president of numerous companies, one of the most important being [[Cirsa]], acquired by the [[Blackstone Group]] investment fund in 2018, with the exception the '''Leisure''' business in Argentina. He is currently the president of [[Nortia Capital Investment Holding (NCIH)]], founded in 2007 as the head company which presides and integrates several types of inversions.\n\nIn 2005 created the [[Manuel Lao Foundation]], in order to join up and make sense of the different donations carried out. In 2017, he is designated [[Doctor Honoris Causa]] by the Catholic University San Antonio of Murcia (UCAM) and in 2020 he was given the title of '''Extraordinary Lecturer and Director of the International Chair of Entrepreneurship and Employment of UCAM'''.\n\n==Personal life==\nManuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez, son of Mr. Candido and Mrs Elena, has been married to Rosa Gorina since 1969 and have three children together: Manuel, Esther and Ingrid Lao Gorina.\n\nIn 1978, he created CIRSA and transformed it into a great corporation. In the year 2005 he sets up the Manuel Lao Foundation   to, according to his own words, ''\u201cgive back to society a part of what he has received from it\u201d''. In 2007 he created '''NORTIA Corporation''', a business conglomerate developing its activity in several sectors.\n\nManuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez has received several awards in recognition of his business and social labour. He has been a member of the boards of directors of Spanish federations, such as [[CEOE]] (Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations) or the '''Promotion of National Labour'''.\nIn his free time, he participates actively in the civil society and devotes himself especially to his family, sports the arts and bonsais, one of his many interests.\n\n==Professional career==\nManuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez is what the North Americans call a '''\u201cself-made man\u201d'''. At 12 years old (in 1956) he emigrated from Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda, town where he had received the title of [[honorary citizen]] (some years later), to [[Terrassa]] where he studied until graduated in [[Industrial Mastery]] and at 14, he started working at [[AEG]].\n\nHis life as an entrepreneur started at 18 in the hotel and catering industry and continued until some years later when he entered the construction sector with '''CELASA''' (1974), a real estate and construction company which developed several projects in Catalonia.\nHis ascending career began in 1978 when he founded the ''International Company of Recreation, S.A.'' (CIRSA), a company dedicated to the electronic design, manufacture, sale and exploitation of recreational and entertainment machines.\n\nThe company acquired an important dimension and in 1983 [[Cirsa]] transformed into a holding in which numerous business areas were covered, such as the electronics, technology, agriculture and livestock, construction, as well as leisure and training centres.\n\nIn 1988, he created '''International Holding Service (IHS)''', with the objective of channelling the entire international leisure and entertainment business, as well as the activities carried out in the remaining sectors. On June 26th 1996, IHS is renamed '''Leisure & Gaming (L&G)'''.\n\nOn the occasion of the designation of Terrassa as headquarters of Grass [[Hockey]] in the [[Olympic Games]] of 1992, in 1989 he promoted the construction of the [[Hotel Don C\u00e1ndido]]; the first 4-star hotel with 130 rooms in Terrassa. The hotel was named after his father, Don C\u00e1ndido, who died in 1984. The hotel activity extended, later, with the management of the [[Hotel Terrassa Park]].\n\nIn July 1998, Manuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez acquired all the shares of the '''CIRSA Group''' and performed a business reorganization, including L&G. In this way, all the activities of the leisure and entertainment area remained in '''CIRSA Business Corporation''' and the rest of the activities in other sectors mentioned above, in the '''L&G Corporation'''.\n\nIn April 2005, he constituted the [[Manuel Lao Foundation]]; an organization for social and non-profit purposes, whose mission is ''to give back to society what has so far received from it by financially helping those organizations, associations or foundations that need collaboration in order to achieve their goal''.\n\nIn September 2007, he set up the '''Nortia Corporation''' that later, in 2018, was renamed [[Nortia Capital Investment Holding]], the business Corporation where all the business areas of all sectors of Manuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez's companies were integrated.\n\nOn July 3rd, 2018, he sold '''CIRSA''' to the [[Blackstone Group]] investment fund, with the exception of the leisure business in Argentina.\n\n==Business Acknowledgments==\nIn 1993 he was elected '''President of the Leisure Studies Foundation''', which, now extinct, grouped the most significant industrialists and entrepreneurs in the economic sector of leisure and entertainment. He dedicated himself to the promotion and research in fields as diverse as culture, professional training and social interest actions.\n\nIn 1994 and, given the crisis situation in the recreational sector in Spain, the Spanish Confederation of Recreational Game Entrepreneurs in the Hotel Industry ('''COFAR''') was created, and Manuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez was elected '''President''', a position he held since its inception, in 1994, and until June 30th 2018. He has also been a very active and valued member in the European Federation [[EUROMAT]].\n\nIn 1996 he became member of the '''Advisory Council of the Business Confederation in Catalonia''', '''Promotion of National Labour'''.\n\nIn March 1997, he assumed the presidency of '''Bail Bonds and Financial Services''', the first and only Reciprocal Guarantee Society in the economic sector of leisure and entertainment.\n\nIn April 2007 Manuel Lao Hern\u00e1ndez began to be a full member of the board of directors of the [[CEOE]] (Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations), in his position as '''President of COFAR'''.\n\nDue to his business career, he has been a speaker or lecturer in different academic forums, among which are:\n\n* ''\u201cThe international deployment of the company: The Man in the Spot\u201d'' conference for [[IESE Business School]]. XXXVI Assembly of the Association of Members of the Business School, IESE.\n* ''\u201cSelf-made Man\u201d'', conference for the Higher School of Administration, [[INSA]].\n* ''\u201cBeing an Entrepreneur\u201d'', conference for the Business Administration School, [[EAE Business School]].\n* ''\u201cThe value of intuition\u201d'' for the [[University of Almeria]], within the Forum of Almeria.\n* ''\u201cThe vision of innovation and business keys\u201d'' UCAM, closing of the conference on market, economy and innovation in food.\n\n==Acknowledgments==\n* 1998.

Most have been courtiers or members of [[British Royal Family|the Royal Family]], and not professional naval officers. The office of Lord High Admiral is one of the nine English [[Great Officers of State]].\n\n==History==\nThe office was created in England late 14th century sometime between 1405/06 and 1412 the two existing older naval commands that of the [[Admiral of the North]] and [[Admiral of the West]] were unified with this office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Durston|first1=Gregory|title=The Admiralty Sessions, 1536-1834: Maritime Crime and the Silver Oar|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443873611|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVwpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Admiral+of+the+North+and+Admiral+of+the+West+were+unified+with+Lord+High+Admiral&source=bl&ots=XnlpLqc1JA&sig=GUCVNMwx2DLdc_9JqRS18ntbAl0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDxe642JXYAhUDPI8KHZcMCXIQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=Admiral%20of%20the%20North%20and%20Admiral%20of%20the%20West%20were%20unified%20with%20Lord%20High%20Admiral&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII (1509\u201347) the [[English Navy]] had expanded to a point where it could not be managed by a single Lord High Admiral alone, therefore day-to-day management of the navy was handed over to a committee that later became known as the [[Navy Board]]. The navy board had [[Samuel Pepys]] as one of its members during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660\u201385), and it ran side-by-side with the [[Board of Admiralty]].<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Dear|first1=edited by I.C.B.|last2=Kemp|first2=Peter|title=The Oxford companion to ships and the sea|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199205684|edition= 2nd|chapter=Lord High Admiral}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early 17th century onwards, when an individual Lord High Admiral was appointed, there was also a [[Lord High Admirals Council|Council of the Lord High Admiral]] which assisted him to perform some of the duties of the [[Admiralty]]. When this office was not occupied by an individual, it was \"put into commission\" and exercised by a [[Board of Admiralty]] headed by a [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]; this was the usual arrangement from 1709 until it was merged with the [[Admiralty]] in 1832.\n\nHowever, the office of Lord High Admiral, which, except for brief periods during its long history, had remained extant, and was not abolished as an official naval post until 1964.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/> In 1964, the office of [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] was also abolished and the functions of the [[Lords Commissioners of Admiralty]] were transferred to the new [[Admiralty Board]] becoming a sub-committee (Navy) of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]]. At the same time, the ancient title of Lord High Admiral was then resumed by the [[British Monarch|sovereign]] personally.\n\n[[Elizabeth II]] held the title for the next 47 years, until in 2011 she conferred the office upon her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] as part of the celebrations for his 90th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Duke of Edinburgh Appointed Lord High Admiral|url=https://www.royal.uk/duke-edinburgh-appointed-lord-high-admiral|website=royal.gov.uk|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The Queen chose this title to honour her husband with as he served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and gave up a promising naval career to support her as consort.<ref name=bbc>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15860155 |title=Prince Philip receives Navy title for 90th birthday |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==High Admirals of England, Ireland and Aquitaine 1385 to 1512==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:Center\"\n!

Most have been courtiers or members of [[British Royal Family|the Royal Family]], and not professional naval officers. The office of Lord High Admiral is one of the nine English [[Great Officers of State]].\n\n==History==\nThe office was created in England late 14th century sometime between 1405/06 and 1412 the two existing older naval commands that of the [[Admiral of the North]] and [[Admiral of the West]] were unified with this office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Durston|first1=Gregory|title=The Admiralty Sessions, 1536-1834: Maritime Crime and the Silver Oar|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443873611|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVwpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=Admiral+of+the+North+and+Admiral+of+the+West+were+unified+with+Lord+High+Admiral&source=bl&ots=XnlpLqc1JA&sig=GUCVNMwx2DLdc_9JqRS18ntbAl0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDxe642JXYAhUDPI8KHZcMCXIQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=Admiral%20of%20the%20North%20and%20Admiral%20of%20the%20West%20were%20unified%20with%20Lord%20High%20Admiral&f=false|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII (1509\u201347) the [[English Navy]] had expanded to a point where it could not be managed by a single Lord High Admiral alone, therefore day-to-day management of the navy was handed over to a committee that later became known as the [[Navy Board]]. The navy board had [[Samuel Pepys]] as one of its members during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660\u201385), and it ran side-by-side with the [[Board of Admiralty]].<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Dear|first1=edited by I.C.B.|last2=Kemp|first2=Peter|title=The Oxford companion to ships and the sea|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199205684|edition= 2nd|chapter=Lord High Admiral}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early 17th century onwards, when an individual Lord High Admiral was appointed, there was also a [[Lord High Admirals Council|Council of the Lord High Admiral]] which assisted him to perform some of the duties of the [[Admiralty]]. When this office was not occupied by an individual, it was \"put into commission\" and exercised by a [[Board of Admiralty]] headed by a [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] this was the usual arrangement from 1709 until it was merged with the [[Admiralty]] in 1832.\n\nHowever, the office of Lord High Admiral, which, except for brief periods during its long history, had remained extant, and was not abolished as an official naval post until 1964.<ref name=\"Oxford University Press\"/> In 1964, the office of [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] was also abolished and the functions of the [[Lords Commissioners of Admiralty]] were transferred to the new [[Admiralty Board]] becoming a sub-committee (Navy) of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]]. At the same time, the ancient title of Lord High Admiral was then resumed by the [[British Monarch|sovereign]] personally.\n\n[[Elizabeth II]] held the title for the next 47 years, until in 2011 she conferred the office upon her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] as part of the celebrations for his 90th birthday.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Duke of Edinburgh Appointed Lord High Admiral|url=https://www.royal.uk/duke-edinburgh-appointed-lord-high-admiral|website=royal.gov.uk|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref> The Queen chose this title to honour her husband with as he served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and gave up a promising naval career to support her as consort.<ref name=bbc>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15860155 |title=Prince Philip receives Navy title for 90th birthday |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==High Admirals of England, Ireland and Aquitaine 1385 to 1512==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:Center\"\n!

His brother was [[Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Avondale|Andrew Stewart, 1st Lord Ochiltree]]. Henry was a fifth-generation male-line descendant of [[Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany]], through his son Walter. He was thus a fourth cousin, twice removed of [[James IV of Scotland]], first husband of Margaret Tudor.\n\n==Marriage to the Queen mother==\nHenry and Margaret Tudor were married on 3 March 1528. Margaret had divorced her second husband [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus]]. She was already mother to [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Margaret Douglas]] from her previous marriages. This third marriage would produce another daughter, Dorothea Stewart, who died young. Reaction to the marriage was swift: Margaret and Henry were besieged at [[Stirling Castle]] by [[John Erskine, 5th Lord Erskine|Lord Erskine]], with the support of James V and her former husband, the Earl of Angus. Henry was imprisoned. However, after James V joined his mother at Stirling, Henry was created Lord Methven. Margaret made Methven captain of her [[Newark Castle, Selkirkshire|castle of Newark]] in [[Ettrick, Scotland|Ettrick]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Buchanan|1985|227-8, 231, 239}}</ref> In 1539, Henry and Margaret let their coalfield at Skeoch to John Craigyngelt.

Margaret Tudor wished to divorce him but James V was reluctant to allow it.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Buchanan|1985|262}}</ref> After she died in 1541, Methven was able to marry his mistress, Janet Stewart, daughter of [[John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl]] and Lady Janet Campbell. Her maternal grandparents were [[Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll]] and Elizabeth Stewart. Elizabeth was a daughter of [[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox]] and Margaret Montgomerie. Margaret was a daughter of [[Alexander Montgomerie, 1st Lord Montgomerie]] and Margaret Boyd.\n\nHenry and Janet were parents to four children:\n\n* [[Henry Stewart, 2nd Lord Methven]] (d. 3 March 1572).\n* Dorothea Stewart.

He said that [[Regent Arran]] had been advised that the modest (\"sober\") Scottish artillery at [[St Andrews Castle]] at the start might have taken the castle, and the prolonged and expensive siege, after Arran had departed, had harmed public opinion. Similarly, a recent ineffective show of artillery at [[Broughty Castle]] had only warned the English to get more support and re-fortify. Now, to take Broughty, more cannon needed to be supplied, and Methven asked for French captains with intelligence of the field, and intelligence to assiege and order artillery.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cameron|1927|208-211}}</ref>\n\nMethven wrote to Mary of Guise again on 3 June 1548 with more strategic advice. He said that he had friends all over Scotland and had been diligent in acquiring intelligence of the motives of those Scots who favoured the English. He found four principal motives; religion, fear, regard for a belief in prophecy, and the ignorant conceit that English justice and rule might be better. He advised her that there were so many dissidents that the unity of Scotland would be best served by offering an act of remission, a general pardon, rather than punishment, as her husband James V had done for rebels during his minority, (on 10 December 1540). Methven thought the defeat at [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh|Pinkie]], (which he called the ''jeornay of Penke''), was due to these causes, and the unorderly haste of the Scottish army.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nHe added that he heard it was already widely known in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] by the end of May that the Scottish artillery at the siege of Broughty Castle would be moved to the [[Siege of Haddington]]. The citizens of Perth hoped a French army would come to protect them from Broughty's English garrison. Methven had issued the guns at Broughty to the [[Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll|Earl of Argyll]]. Methven starting moving the guns on 6 June. As an example to the local [[laird]]s who were obliged to do this work, he yoked 240 oxen and began to drag the guns through his and [[William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven|Lord Ruthven]]'s lands. At Haddington, he reported on 5 July; \"all nycht all our greit artallzery lawborit and has dong the tolbutht and reft an pece that lay betuix it and the kirk of the Freyris.\" But on 17 July, the French officer [[Andr\u00e9 de Montalembert|D'Ess\u00e9]] ordered the guns to be withdrawn.
