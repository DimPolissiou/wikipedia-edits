Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the [[value (ethics)|values]], [[preference]]s and beliefs of the decision-maker. Every decision-making process produces a final [[choice]], which may or may not prompt action.\n\nResearch about decision-making is also published under the label [[problem solving]], in particular in European [[psychological research]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Complex problem solving: the European perspective|date=1995|publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]]|isbn=978-0805813364|editor1-last=Frensch|editor1-first=Peter A.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|oclc=32131412|editor2-last=Funke|editor2-first=Joachim}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nDecision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity yielding a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less [[Rationality|rational]] or [[Irrationality|irrational]] and can be based on [[explicit knowledge|explicit]] or [[tacit knowledge]] and beliefs. Tacit knowledge is often used to fill the gaps in complex decision making processes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brockmann |first1=Erich N. |last2=Anthony |first2=William P. |date=December 2016 |title=Tacit knowledge and strategic decision making |journal=[[Group & Organization Management]] |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=436\u2013455 |doi=10.1177/1059601102238356}}</ref> Usually both of these types of knowledge, tacit and explicit, are used together in the decision-making process.\n\nHuman performance has been the subject of active research from several perspectives:\n* [[Psychology|Psychological]]: examining individual decisions in the context of a set of needs, preferences and values the individual has or seeks.\n* [[Cognition|Cognitive]]: the decision-making process regarded as a continuous process integrated in the interaction with the environment.\n* [[Normative]]: the analysis of individual decisions concerned with the logic of decision-making, or [[communicative rationality]], and the invariant choice it leads to.<ref name=\"Kahneman\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Kahneman |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-link=Daniel Kahneman |editor2-last=Tversky |editor2-first=Amos |editor2-link=Amos Tversky |date=2000 |title=Choices, values, and frames |location=New York; Cambridge, UK |publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]; [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521621724 |oclc=42934579 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P5GsREMbUmAC&pg=PA211 211]}}</ref>\n\nA major part of decision-making involves the analysis of a finite set of alternatives described in terms of evaluative criteria. Then the task might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another task might be to find the best alternative or to determine the relative total priority of each alternative (for instance, if alternatives represent projects competing for funds) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Solving such problems is the focus of [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA). This area of decision-making, although very old, has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners and is still highly debated as there are many MCDA methods which may yield very different results when they are applied on exactly the same data.<ref name=MCDM>{{cite book |last=Triantaphyllou |first=Evangelos |title=Multi-criteria decision making methods: a comparative study |volume=44 |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |series=Applied optimization |year=2000 |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |page=320 |url=http://www.csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm |isbn=978-0792366072 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-3157-6}}</ref> This leads to the formulation of a [[decision-making paradox]]. [[Logic]]al decision-making is an important part of all science-based professions, where specialists apply their [[knowledge]] in a given area to make informed decisions. For example, medical decision-making often involves a [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and the selection of appropriate treatment. But [[naturalistic decision-making]] research shows that in situations with higher time pressure, higher stakes, or increased ambiguities, experts may use [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive]] decision-making rather than structured approaches. They may follow a [[recognition primed decision]] that fits their experience and arrive at a course of action without weighing alternatives.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe decision-maker's environment can play a part in the decision-making process.

Individual decision-making techniques can also often be applied by a group.\n\n===Group===\n* [[Consensus decision-making]] tries to avoid \"winners\" and \"losers\". Consensus requires that a majority approve a given course of action, but that the minority agree to go along with the course of action. In other words, if the minority opposes the course of action, consensus requires that the course of action be modified to remove objectionable features.\n* [[Voting|Voting-based methods]]:\n** [[Majority]] requires support from more than 50% of the members of the group. Thus, the bar for action is lower than with consensus.\n** [[Plurality voting system|Plurality]], where the largest block in a group decides, even if it falls short of a majority.\n** [[Quadratic voting]] allows participants to cast their ''preference'' and ''intensity of preference'' for each decision (as opposed to a simple ''for'' or ''against'' decision). It addresses issues of [[voting paradox]] and [[Majority rule|majority-rule]].\n** [[Range voting]] lets each member score one or more of the available options. The option with the highest average is chosen. This method has experimentally been shown to produce the lowest [[Bayesian regret]] among common voting methods, even when voters are strategic.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n* [[Delphi method]] is a structured communication technique for groups, originally developed for collaborative forecasting but has also been used for [[Delphi method#Use in policy-making|policy making]].\n* [[Dotmocracy]] is a facilitation method that relies on the use of special forms called Dotmocracy Sheets to allow large groups to collectively brainstorm and recognize agreement on an unlimited number of ideas they have authored.\n* [[Participative decision-making]] occurs when an authority opens up the decision-making process to a group of people for a collaborative effort.\n* [[Decision engineering]] uses a visual map of the decision-making process based on [[system dynamics]] and can be automated through a decision modeling tool, integrating [[big data]], [[machine learning]], and expert knowledge as appropriate.\n\n===Individual===\n* [[Decisional balance sheet]]: listing the advantages and disadvantages (benefits and costs, pros and cons) of each option, as suggested by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' and by [[Benjamin Franklin]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Franklin |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Franklin |date=1975 |origyear=1772 |chapter=To Joseph Priestley |editor-last=Willcox |editor-first=William Bradford |title=The papers of Benjamin Franklin: January 1 through December 31, 1772 |volume=19 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=299\u2013300 |isbn=978-0300018653 |oclc=310601 |chapterurl=http://franklinpapers.org/yale?vol=19&page=299a |ref=harv}}</ref>\n* [[Expected utility hypothesis|Expected-value optimization]]: choosing the alternative with the highest probability-weighted [[utility]], possibly with some consideration for [[risk aversion]].

See also [[Decision analysis]] and [[Decision theory]].\n* [[Satisficing]]: examining alternatives only until the first acceptable one is found. The opposite is [[Maximization (psychology)|maximizing]] or [[optimizing]], in which many or all alternatives are examined in order to find the best option.\n* [[Argument from authority|Acquiesce to a person in authority]] or an \"expert\"; \"[[Superior orders|just following orders]]\".\n* [[Anti-authoritarianism]]: taking the most opposite action compared to the advice of mistrusted

Recent research{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} has shown that there are differences in cognitive processes between adolescents and adults during decision-making. Researchers have concluded that differences in decision-making are not due to a lack of logic or reasoning, but more due to the immaturity of [[psychosocial]] capacities that influence decision-making. Examples of their undeveloped capacities which influence decision-making would be impulse control, emotion regulation, [[delayed gratification]] and resistance to [[peer pressure]]. In the past, researchers have thought that adolescent behavior was simply due to incompetency regarding decision-making. Currently, researchers have concluded that adults and adolescents are both competent decision-makers, not just adults. However, adolescents' competent decision-making skills decrease when psychosocial capacities become present.\n\nRecent research{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} has shown that risk-taking behaviors in adolescents may be the product of interactions between the socioemotional brain network and its [[Executive functions|cognitive-control network]]. The socioemotional part of the brain processes social and emotional stimuli and has been shown to be important in [[Reward system|reward processing]]. The cognitive-control network assists in planning and self-regulation. Both of these sections of the brain change over the course of [[puberty]]. However, the socioemotional network changes quickly and abruptly, while the cognitive-control network changes more gradually. Because of this difference in change, the cognitive-control network, which usually regulates the socioemotional network, struggles to control the socioemotional network when psychosocial capacities are present.{{clarify|date=January 2014}}\n\nWhen adolescents are exposed to social and emotional stimuli, their socioemotional network is activated as well as areas of the brain involved in reward processing. Because teens often gain a sense of reward from risk-taking behaviors, their repetition becomes ever more probable due to the reward experienced. In this, the process mirrors [[addiction]]. Teens can become addicted to risky behavior because they are in a high state of arousal and are rewarded for it not only by their own internal functions but also by their peers around them.\n\nAdults are generally better able to control their risk-taking because their cognitive-control system has matured enough to the point where it can control the socioemotional network, even in the context of high arousal or when psychosocial capacities are present. Also, adults are less likely to find themselves in situations that push them to do risky things. For example, teens are more likely to be around peers who peer pressure them into doing things, while adults are not as exposed to this sort of social setting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Margo|last2=Steinberg|first2=Laurence|authorlink2=Laurence Steinberg|date=July 2005|title=Peer influence on risk taking, risk preference, and risky decision making in adolescence and adulthood: an experimental study|url=http://uwf.edu/smathews/documents/peerroleinrisktakinggardnerandsteinberg.pdf|journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]]|volume=41|issue=4|pages=625\u2013635|citeseerx=10.1.1.556.4973|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.625|pmid=16060809}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg|date=April 2007|title=Risk taking in adolescence: new perspectives from brain and behavioral science|journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]|volume=16|issue=2|pages=55\u201359|citeseerx=10.1.1.519.7099|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00475.x}}</ref>\n\nA recent study suggests that adolescents have difficulties adequately adjusting beliefs in response to bad news (such as reading that smoking poses a greater risk to health than they thought), but do not differ from adults in their ability to alter beliefs in response to good news.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moutsiana|first1=Christina|last2=Garrett|first2=Neil|last3=Clarke|first3=Richard C.|last4=Lotto|first4=R.

Further psychological research has identified individual differences between two cognitive styles: ''[[Maximization (psychology)|maximizers]]'' try to make an [[optimal decision]], whereas ''[[satisficer]]s'' simply try to find a solution that is \"good enough\".

Both styles are utilized in the game of chess. According to Katsenelinboigen, the two styles reflect two basic approaches to [[uncertainty]]: deterministic (combinational style) and indeterministic (positional style). Katsenelinboigen's definition of the two styles are the following.\n\nThe combinational style is characterized by:\n* a very narrow, clearly defined, primarily material goal; and\n* a program that links the initial position with the final outcome.\n\nIn defining the combinational style in chess, Katsenelinboigen wrote: \"The combinational style features a clearly formulated limited objective, namely the capture of material (the main constituent element of a chess position). The objective is implemented via a well-defined, and in some cases, unique sequence of moves aimed at reaching the set goal. As a rule, this sequence leaves no options for the opponent. Finding a combinational objective allows the player to focus all his energies on efficient execution, that is, the player's analysis may be limited to the pieces directly partaking in the combination. This approach is the crux of the combination and the combinational style of play.<ref name=\"Concept of Indeterminism\"/>{{rp|57}}\n\nThe positional style is distinguished by:\n* a positional goal; and\n* a formation of semi-complete linkages between the initial step and final outcome.\n\n\"Unlike the combinational player, the positional player is occupied, first and foremost, with the elaboration of the position that will allow him to develop in the unknown future. In playing the positional style, the player must evaluate relational and material parameters as independent variables. ... The positional style gives the player the opportunity to develop a position until it becomes pregnant with a combination. However, the combination is not the final goal of the positional player{{spaced ndash}}it helps him to achieve the desirable, keeping in mind a predisposition for the future development.

She claimed that a person's decision-making style correlates well with how they score on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would tend to have a logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style.

In this style, the individual would research the new job being offered, review their current job, and look at the pros and cons of taking the new job versus staying with their current company.\n* The ''intuitive'' style is confidence in one's initial feelings and gut reactions. In this style, if the individual initially prefers the new job because they have a feeling that the work environment is better suited for them, then they would decide to take the new job. The individual might not make this decision as soon as the job is offered.\n* The ''dependent'' style is asking for other people's input and instructions on what decision should be made. In this style, the individual could ask friends, family, coworkers, etc., but the individual might not ask all of these people.\n* The ''avoidant'' style is averting the responsibility of making a decision. In this style, the individual would not make a decision. Therefore, the individual would stick with their current job.\n* The ''spontaneous'' style is a need to make a decision as soon as possible rather than waiting to make a decision. In this style, the individual would either reject or accept the job as soon as it is offered.\n\n== Organizational vs. individual level ==\nThere are a few characteristics that differentiate organizational decision-making from individual decision-making as studied in lab experiments <ref>Shapira, Z. (2002). \"Organizational Decision Making. Cambridge Series on Judgment and Decision Making\", Cambridge University Press: pp.4-6. {{ISBN|0521890500}}, 9780521890502 </ref>:\n\n1. Unlike most lab studies of individual decision-making, ''ambiguity'' is pervasive in organizations. There is often only ambiguous information, and there is ambiguity about preferences as well as about interpreting the history of decisions.\n\n2. Decision-making in and by organizations is embedded in a ''longitudinal'' context, meaning that participants in organizational decision-making are a part of ongoing processes. Even if they don't take on active roles in all phases of decision-making, they are part of the Decision Process and its consequences. Decisions in organizations are made in a sequential manner, and commitment may be more important in such processes than judgmental accuracy. In contrast, most lab studies of individual decision-making are conducted in artificial settings (lab) that are not connected to the subjects\u2019 ongoing activities.\n\n3. ''Incentives'' play an important role in organizational decision-making. Incentives, penalties, and their ramifications are real and may have long-lasting effects. These effects are intensified due to the longitudinal nature of decision-making in organizational settings. Incentives and penalties are very salient in organizations, and often they command managerial attention.\n\n4. Many executives, especially in middle management, may make ''repeated decisions'' on similar issues. Managers may develop a sense of using his/her skills (which may be faulty) and a sense of having control and using one's skills are pervasive in managerial thinking about risk taking. Several repeated decisions are made by following rules rather than by using pure information processing modes.\n\n5. ''Conflict'' is pervasive in organizational decision-making. Many times power considerations and agenda setting determine decisions rather than calculations based on the decision's parameters. The nature of authority relations may have a large impact on the way decisions are made in organizations, which are basically political systems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=no |others=no |about=yes |label=Decision-making}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Aboulomania]]\n* [[Adaptive performance]]\n* [[Agent (economics)]]\n* [[Analytic hierarchy process]]\n* [[Argument map]]\n* [[Business decision mapping]]\n* [[Choice architecture]]\n* [[Choice modelling]]\n* [[Concept driven strategy]]\n* [[Decision downloading]]\n* [[Decision fatigue]]\n* [[Decision quality]]\n* [[Decision-making unit]]\n* [[Foresight (psychology)]]\n* [[Framing (social sciences)]]\n* [[Free will]]\n* [[Idea networking]]\n* [[Robust decision]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Systems engineering}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Decision-Making}}\n[[Category:Decision-making| ]]\n[[Category:Neuropsychological assessment]]\n[[Category:Unsolved problems in neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Analysis]]\n[[Category:Prediction]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Cognitive process resulting in choosing a course of action}}\n{{about|decision making as analyzed in psychology|a broader discipline|Decision theory}}\n[[File:Wikipedia article-creation-2.svg|thumb|Sample [[flowchart]] representing a decision process to add a new article to Wikipedia.]]\n\nIn [[psychology]], '''decision-making''' (also spelled '''decision making''' and '''decisionmaking''') is regarded as the [[Cognition|cognitive process]] resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities. Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the [[value (ethics)|values]], [[preference]]s and beliefs of the decision-maker. Every decision-making process produces a final [[choice]], which may or may not prompt action.\n\nResearch about decision-making is also published under the label [[problem solving]], in particular in European [[psychological research]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Complex problem solving: the European perspective|date=1995|publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]]|isbn=978-0805813364|editor1-last=Frensch|editor1-first=Peter A.|location=Hillsdale, NJ|oclc=32131412|editor2-last=Funke|editor2-first=Joachim}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nDecision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity yielding a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less [[Rationality|rational]] or [[Irrationality|irrational]] and can be based on [[explicit knowledge|explicit]] or [[tacit knowledge]] and beliefs.

Then the task might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another task might be to find the best alternative or to determine the relative total priority of each alternative (for instance, if alternatives represent projects competing for funds) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Solving such problems is the focus of [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA). This area of decision-making, although very old, has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners and is still highly debated as there are many MCDA methods which may yield very different results when they are applied on exactly the same data.<ref name=MCDM>{{cite book |last=Triantaphyllou |first=Evangelos |title=Multi-criteria decision making methods: a comparative study |volume=44 |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |series=Applied optimization |year=2000 |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |page=320 |url=http://www.csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm |isbn=978-0792366072 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-3157-6}}</ref> This leads to the formulation of a [[decision-making paradox]]. [[Logic]]al decision-making is an important part of all science-based professions, where specialists apply their [[knowledge]] in a given area to make informed decisions. For example, medical decision-making often involves a [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and the selection of appropriate treatment. But [[naturalistic decision-making]] research shows that in situations with higher time pressure, higher stakes, or increased ambiguities, experts may use [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive]] decision-making rather than structured approaches. They may follow a [[recognition primed decision]] that fits their experience and arrive at a course of action without weighing alternatives.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe decision-maker's environment can play a part in the decision-making process.

Consensus requires that a majority approve a given course of action, but that the minority agree to go along with the course of action. In other words, if the minority opposes the course of action, consensus requires that the course of action be modified to remove objectionable features.\n* [[Voting|Voting-based methods]]:\n** [[Majority]] requires support from more than 50% of the members of the group.

Recent research{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} has shown that there are differences in cognitive processes between adolescents and adults during decision-making. Researchers have concluded that differences in decision-making are not due to a lack of logic or reasoning, but more due to the immaturity of [[psychosocial]] capacities that influence decision-making. Examples of their undeveloped capacities which influence decision-making would be impulse control, emotion regulation, [[delayed gratification]] and resistance to [[peer pressure]]. In the past, researchers have thought that adolescent behavior was simply due to incompetency regarding decision-making. Currently, researchers have concluded that adults and adolescents are both competent decision-makers, not just adults. However, adolescents' competent decision-making skills decrease when psychosocial capacities become present.\n\nRecent research{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} has shown that risk-taking behaviors in adolescents may be the product of interactions between the socioemotional brain network and its [[Executive functions|cognitive-control network]]. The socioemotional part of the brain processes social and emotional stimuli and has been shown to be important in [[Reward system|reward processing]]. The cognitive-control network assists in planning and self-regulation. Both of these sections of the brain change over the course of [[puberty]]. However, the socioemotional network changes quickly and abruptly, while the cognitive-control network changes more gradually. Because of this difference in change, the cognitive-control network, which usually regulates the socioemotional network, struggles to control the socioemotional network when psychosocial capacities are present.{{clarify|date=January 2014}}\n\nWhen adolescents are exposed to social and emotional stimuli, their socioemotional network is activated as well as areas of the brain involved in reward processing. Because teens often gain a sense of reward from risk-taking behaviors, their repetition becomes ever more probable due to the reward experienced. In this, the process mirrors [[addiction]]. Teens can become addicted to risky behavior because they are in a high state of arousal and are rewarded for it not only by their own internal functions but also by their peers around them.\n\nAdults are generally better able to control their risk-taking because their cognitive-control system has matured enough to the point where it can control the socioemotional network, even in the context of high arousal or when psychosocial capacities are present. Also, adults are less likely to find themselves in situations that push them to do risky things. For example, teens are more likely to be around peers who peer pressure them into doing things, while adults are not as exposed to this sort of social setting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Margo|last2=Steinberg|first2=Laurence|authorlink2=Laurence Steinberg|date=July 2005|title=Peer influence on risk taking, risk preference, and risky decision making in adolescence and adulthood: an experimental study|url=http://uwf.edu/smathews/documents/peerroleinrisktakinggardnerandsteinberg.pdf|journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]]|volume=41|issue=4|pages=625\u2013635|citeseerx=10.1.1.556.4973|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.625|pmid=16060809}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg|date=April 2007|title=Risk taking in adolescence: new perspectives from brain and behavioral science|journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]|volume=16|issue=2|pages=55\u201359|citeseerx=10.1.1.519.7099|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00475.x}}</ref>\n\nA recent study suggests that adolescents have difficulties adequately adjusting beliefs in response to bad news (such as reading that smoking poses a greater risk to health than they thought), but do not differ from adults in their ability to alter beliefs in response to good news.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moutsiana|first1=Christina|last2=Garrett|first2=Neil|last3=Clarke|first3=Richard C.|last4=Lotto|first4=R.

Further psychological research has identified individual differences between two cognitive styles: ''[[Maximization (psychology)|maximizers]]'' try to make an [[optimal decision]], whereas ''[[satisficer]]s'' simply try to find a solution that is \"good enough\".

Both styles are utilized in the game of chess. According to Katsenelinboigen, the two styles reflect two basic approaches to [[uncertainty]]: deterministic (combinational style) and indeterministic (positional style). Katsenelinboigen's definition of the two styles are the following.\n\nThe combinational style is characterized by:\n* a very narrow, clearly defined, primarily material goal; and\n* a program that links the initial position with the final outcome.\n\nIn defining the combinational style in chess, Katsenelinboigen wrote: \"The combinational style features a clearly formulated limited objective, namely the capture of material (the main constituent element of a chess position). The objective is implemented via a well-defined, and in some cases, unique sequence of moves aimed at reaching the set goal. As a rule, this sequence leaves no options for the opponent. Finding a combinational objective allows the player to focus all his energies on efficient execution, that is, the player's analysis may be limited to the pieces directly partaking in the combination. This approach is the crux of the combination and the combinational style of play.<ref name=\"Concept of Indeterminism\"/>{{rp|57}}\n\nThe positional style is distinguished by:\n* a positional goal; and\n* a formation of semi-complete linkages between the initial step and final outcome.\n\n\"Unlike the combinational player, the positional player is occupied, first and foremost, with the elaboration of the position that will allow him to develop in the unknown future. In playing the positional style, the player must evaluate relational and material parameters as independent variables. ...

The terminal points on these dimensions are: ''thinking'' and ''feeling''; ''extroversion'' and ''introversion''; ''judgment'' and ''perception''; and ''sensing'' and ''intuition''. She claimed that a person's decision-making style correlates well with how they score on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would tend to have a logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style. However, some psychologists say that the MBTI lacks reliability and validity and is poorly constructed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pittenger |first=David J. |date=2005 |title=Cautionary comments regarding the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator |journal=[[Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research]] |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=210\u2013221 |doi=10.1037/1065-9293.57.3.210 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232494957}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hogan |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Hogan (psychologist) |date=2007 |title=Personality and the fate of organizations |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=978-0805841428 |oclc=65400436 |page=28 |quote=Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie...}}</ref>\n\nOther studies suggest that these national or [[cross-cultural differences in decision-making]] exist across entire societies.

In the examples below, the individual is working for a company and is offered a job from a different company.\n* The ''rational'' style is an in-depth search for, and a strong consideration of, other options and/or information prior to making a decision. In this style, the individual would research the new job being offered, review their current job, and look at the pros and cons of taking the new job versus staying with their current company.\n* The ''intuitive'' style is confidence in one's initial feelings and gut reactions. In this style, if the individual initially prefers the new job because they have a feeling that the work environment is better suited for them, then they would decide to take the new job. The individual might not make this decision as soon as the job is offered.\n* The ''dependent'' style is asking for other people's input and instructions on what decision should be made. In this style, the individual could ask friends, family, coworkers, etc., but the individual might not ask all of these people.\n* The ''avoidant'' style is averting the responsibility of making a decision. In this style, the individual would not make a decision. Therefore, the individual would stick with their current job.\n* The ''spontaneous'' style is a need to make a decision as soon as possible rather than waiting to make a decision. In this style, the individual would either reject or accept the job as soon as it is offered.\n\n== Organizational vs. individual level ==\nThere are a few characteristics that differentiate organizational decision-making from individual decision-making as studied in lab experiments <ref>Shapira, Z. (2002). \"Organizational Decision Making. Cambridge Series on Judgment and Decision Making\", Cambridge University Press: pp.4-6. {{ISBN|0521890500}}, 9780521890502 </ref>:\n\n1. Unlike most lab studies of individual decision-making, ''ambiguity'' is pervasive in organizations. There is often only ambiguous information, and there is ambiguity about preferences as well as about interpreting the history of decisions.\n\n2. Decision-making in and by organizations is embedded in a ''longitudinal'' context, meaning that participants in organizational decision-making are a part of ongoing processes. Even if they don't take on active roles in all phases of decision-making, they are part of the Decision Process and its consequences. Decisions in organizations are made in a sequential manner, and commitment may be more important in such processes than judgmental accuracy. In contrast, most lab studies of individual decision-making are conducted in artificial settings (lab) that are not connected to the subjects\u2019 ongoing activities.\n\n3. ''Incentives'' play an important role in organizational decision-making. Incentives, penalties, and their ramifications are real and may have long-lasting effects. These effects are intensified due to the longitudinal nature of decision-making in organizational settings. Incentives and penalties are very salient in organizations, and often they command managerial attention.\n\n4. Many executives, especially in middle management, may make ''repeated decisions'' on similar issues. Managers may develop a sense of using his/her skills (which may be faulty) and a sense of having control and using one's skills are pervasive in managerial thinking about risk taking. Several repeated decisions are made by following rules rather than by using pure information processing modes.\n\n5. ''Conflict'' is pervasive in organizational decision-making. Many times power considerations and agenda setting determine decisions rather than calculations based on the decision's parameters. The nature of authority relations may have a large impact on the way decisions are made in organizations, which are basically political systems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=no |others=no |about=yes |label=Decision-making}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Aboulomania]]\n* [[Adaptive performance]]\n* [[Agent (economics)]]\n* [[Analytic hierarchy process]]\n* [[Argument map]]\n* [[Business decision mapping]]\n* [[Choice architecture]]\n* [[Choice modelling]]\n* [[Concept driven strategy]]\n* [[Decision downloading]]\n* [[Decision fatigue]]\n* [[Decision quality]]\n* [[Decision-making unit]]\n* [[Foresight (psychology)]]\n* [[Framing (social sciences)]]\n* [[Free will]]\n* [[Idea networking]]\n* [[Robust decision]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Systems engineering}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Decision-Making}}\n[[Category:Decision-making| ]]\n[[Category:Neuropsychological assessment]]\n[[Category:Unsolved problems in neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Analysis]]\n[[Category:Prediction]]\n", "name_user": "JoRoberts1", "label": "safe", "comment": "To aid in fluidity of article organization", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making"}

The work is supposedly the original for subsequent tales of poor boys of a heroic nature who have \"made good\". The change in style is noticeable from Marivaux's literary style to the more racy conclusion written by the other author.\n\n==Summary of plot==\nJacob is the son of a poor peasant farmer in provincial France, and the family usually transport the wines of the local estate owner. Jacob ends up in the estate owner's house in Paris as a sort of servant, where a serving girl Genevieve falls in love with him. The master encourages them to get married with the thinly disguised attempt of keeping her as a mistress but paying Jacob handsomely. Jacob refuses to take part in this but is on the point of being forced to agree when the master dies. He leaves nothing but debts and the household is broken up.\n\nJacob sets off for home, and on the way passes through the town. A lady has collapsed on the bridge and Jacob picks her up and takes her home before she dies of exposure or exhaustion. She is the younger of a pair of pious middle aged sisters living together. The younger is so grateful to Jacob that she wants to help him, and Jacob is allowed to stay for the night. The interfering director (their religious advisor) does not like Jacob and stirs the elder against him. Eventually the two sisters fall into a row about him, and the younger leaves home, finding lodgings where Jacob can also stay, with Mme d\u2019Alain and her disagreeable daughter. Eventually they decide to get married, but this results in severe opposition from the elder and the director who put every obstacle in their way, including an interview with the magistrate. However Jacob charms the company, including the influential and attractive Mme de Ferval, and so the marriage is allowed to proceed. On the way home from the interview Jacob gets involved in a domestic dispute where a man stabs his girlfriend, leaving Jacob to pick up the sword and get arrested. He spends some days in prison before his innocence is established, and finally marries Mlle Halbert.\n\nMme de Ferval takes an interest in Jacob and recommends him to M. de Fercourt a powerful financier who can offer him a job. However, as he is offered the job there is an appeal from an attractive girl Mme d'Orville and her mother, whose husband has just been thrown out of the job. Jacob magnanimously gives up the offer provided the husband, who is very ill is allowed to keep the job. Mme de Ferval arranges a secret rendez-vous with Jacob, but the occasion is lost when a young officer bursts in thinking there was someone else there. Jacob realises the situation he has got himself into and the nature of Mme de Ferval and gets away. In another adventure he manages to save the life of a man who has been set upon by three villains. Jacob is going to the opera with this Compte d'Orsan, when the text of Marivaux finishes.\n\nAn apocryphal suite has been written in which M. d'Orville turns out to be a wealthy man who can give Jacob a good position. Jacob's elder brother reappears after his marriage goes badly wrong and his profligate wife leaves him bankrupt. D'Orsan also introduces Mme De Vambures a wealthy widow. Jacob's wife dies and so he is free to set his hand at Mme de Vambures. Eventually they marry as do D'Orsan and Mme d'Orville.

The work is supposedly the original for subsequent tales of poor boys of a heroic nature who have \"made good\". The change in style is noticeable from Marivaux\u2019s literary style to the more racy conclusion written by the other author. \n\n==Summary of plot==\nJacob is the son of a poor peasant farmer in provincial France, and the family usually transport the wines of the local estate owner. Jacob ends up in the estate owner's house in Paris as a sort of servant, where a serving girl Genevieve falls in love with him. The master encourages them to get married with the thinly disguised attempt of keeping her as a mistress but paying Jacob handsomely. Jacob refuses to take part in this but is on the point of being forced to agree when the master dies. He leaves nothing but debts and the household is broken up. \n\nJacob sets off for home, and on the way passes though the town. A lady has collapsed on the bridge and Jacob picks her up and takes her home before she dies of exposure or exhaustion. She is the younger of a pair of pious middle aged sisters living together. The younger is so grateful to Jacob that she wants to help him, and Jacob is allowed to stay for the night. The interfering director (their religious advisor) does not like Jacob and stirs the elder against him. Eventually the two sisters fall into a row about him, and the younger leaves home, finding lodgings where Jacob can also stay, with Mme d\u2019Alain and her disagreeable daughter. Eventually they decide to get married, but this results in severe opposition from the elder and the director who put every obstacle in their way, including an interview with the magistrate. However Jacob charms the company, including the influential and attractive Mme de Ferval, and so the marriage is allowed to proceed. On the way home from the interview Jacob gets involved in a domestic dispute where a man stabs his girlfriend, leaving Jacob to pick up the sword and get arrested. He spends some days in prison before his innocence is established, and finally marries Mlle Halbert. \n\nMme de Ferval takes an interest in Jacob and recommends him to M. de Fercourt a powerful financier who can offer him a job. However as he is offered the job there is an appeal from an attractive girl Mme d'Orville and her mother, whose husband has just been thrown out of the job. Jacob magnanimously gives up the offer provided the husband, who is very ill is allowed to keep the job. Mme de Ferval arranges a secret rendez-vous with Jacob, but the occasion is lost when a young officer bursts in thinking there was someone else there. Jacob realises the situation he has got himself into and the nature of Mme de Ferval and gets away. In another adventure he manages to save the life of a man who has been set upon by three villains. Jacob is going to the opera with this Compte d'Orsan, when the text of Marivaux finishes.\n\nAn apocryphal suite has been written in which M. d'Orville turns out to be a wealthy man who can give Jacob a good position. Jacob's elder brother reappears after his marriage goes badly wrong and his profligate wife leaves him bankrupt. D'Orsan also introduces Mme De Vambures a wealthy widow. Jacob\u2019s wife dies and so he is free to set his hand at Mme de Vambures. Eventually they marry as do D'Orsan and Mme d'Orville.  Jacob becomes wealthy and eventually his wife buys for him the estate in the village in which he grew up He therefore returns a wealthy man to meet his parents. He has three children and he also brings up his nephews and all are settled in good positions. Eventually all situations resolve themselves happily.\n\n==Main characters==\n*Jacob le Valle\n*Genevieve\n*Mlle Halbert younger\n*Mlle Halbert elder\n*Mme de Ferval\n*M d'Orville\n*Mme de Vambures\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Peter Brooks, ''The Novel of worldliness; Cr\u00e9billon, Marivaux, Laclos, Stendhal'', Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1969.\n* David Coward, ''Marivaux, La Vie de Marianne and Le paysan parvenu'', London: Grant & Cutler, 1982.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paysan Parvenu, La}}\n[[Category:1734 novels]]\n[[Category:18th-century French novels]]\n[[Category:Unfinished novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in France]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: passes though  \u2192  passes through,typo(s) fixed: However  \u2192 However, , \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Paysan_parvenu"}

This is the evidence used to assume that Irenaeus was born in Smyrna during the 130s\u2013140s.</ref> Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was brought up in a Christian family rather than converting as an adult.\n\nDuring the persecution of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the [[Roman Emperor]] from 161\u2013180, Irenaeus was a priest of the Church of Lyon. The clergy of that city, many of whom were suffering imprisonment for the faith, sent him in 177 to Rome with a letter to [[Pope Eleutherius]] concerning the heresy of [[Montanism]], and that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits. While Irenaeus was in Rome, a persecution took place in Lyon. Returning to Gaul, Irenaeus succeeded the [[martyr]] [[Saint Pothinus]] and became the second [[bishop of Lyon]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.4.1</ref>\n\nDuring the religious peace which followed the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies''). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may have taken place in Asia Minor or in Rome.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', 1.pr.2, 4.pr.2</ref> However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of '[[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus the Magician]]' living and teaching in the [[Rhone valley]].<ref>Against Heresies 1.13.7</ref>\n\nLittle is known about the career of Irenaeus after he became bishop. The last action reported of him (by [[Eusebius]], 150 years later) is that in 190 or 191, he exerted influence on [[Pope Victor I]] not to excommunicate the Christian communities of Asia Minor which persevered in the practice of the [[Quartodeciman]] celebration of [[Easter]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.24.1ff</ref>\n\nNothing is known of the date of his death, which must have occurred at the end of the second  or the beginning of the third century. He is regarded as a martyr by the  Catholic Church and by some within the Orthodox Church.<ref>[[Gregory of Tours]] is the first to mention a tradition which held Irenaeus to be a martyr</ref>  He was buried under the Church of Saint John in Lyon, which was later renamed St Irenaeus in his honour. The tomb and his remains were utterly destroyed in 1562 by the [[Huguenots]].\n\n==Writings==\nIrenaeus wrote a number of books, but the most important that survives is the ''Against Heresies'' (or, in its [[Latin language|Latin]] title, ''Adversus haereses'').  In Book I, Irenaeus talks about the Valentinian Gnostics and their predecessors, who he says go as far back as the magician [[Simon Magus]].  In Book II he attempts to provide proof that [[Valentinianism]] contains no merit in terms of its doctrines.  In Book III Irenaeus purports to show that these doctrines are false, by providing counter-evidence gleaned from the [[Gospel]]s.  Book IV consists of Jesus' sayings, and here Irenaeus also stresses the unity of the Old Testament and the Gospel.  In the final volume, Book V, Irenaeus focuses on more sayings of Jesus plus the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].<ref>Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 6. Routledge 1997.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus wrote: \"One should not seek among others the truth that can be easily gotten from the Church. For in her, as in a rich treasury, the apostles have placed all that pertains to truth, so that everyone can drink this beverage of life. She is the door of life.\" (Irenaeus of Lyons, ''Against Heresies'', III.4)<ref>[http://www.orthodoxchurchquotes.com/category/sayings-from-saints-elders-and-fathers/st-irenaeus-of-lyon/ \"St. Irenaeus of Lyon\", Orthodox Church Quotes]</ref> But he also said, \"Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice<ref>Most, William G., ''The Holy Spirit and the Church'', Notre Dame Institute Press, 1991, p. 76</ref> Irenaeus recognized that all who feared and loved God, practiced justice and piety towards their neighbors, and desired to see Christ, insofar as they were able to do so, will be saved. Since many were not able to have an explicit desire to see Christ, but only implicit, it is clear that for Irenaeus this is enough.\n\n[[File:POxy405.jpg|thumb|right|Cambridge University library manuscript 4113 / Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 405.  Irenaeus. Ca. 200 AD.]]The purpose of \"Against Heresies\" was to refute the teachings of various Gnostic groups; apparently, several Greek merchants had begun an oratorial campaign in Irenaeus' bishopric, teaching that the material world was the accidental creation of an evil god, from which we are to escape by the pursuit of ''gnosis''.  Irenaeus argued that the true gnosis is in fact knowledge of Christ, which redeems rather than escapes from bodily existence.<ref>source needed</ref>\n\nUntil the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Library of Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, ''Against Heresies'' was the best-surviving description of Gnosticism. Some religious scholars have argued the findings at Nag Hammadi have shown Irenaeus' description of Gnosticism to be inaccurate and polemic in nature.<ref>Pagels, Elaine. ''Beyond Belief'', Pan Books, 2005. p. 54</ref>  However, the general consensus among modern scholars is that Irenaeus was fairly accurate in his transmission of Gnostic beliefs, and that the Nag Hammadi texts have raised no substantial challenges to the overall accuracy of Irenaeus' information.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orthodoxy and Heresy in Early Christian Contexts: Reconsidering the Bauer Thesis|last=Hartog|first=Paul A.|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61097-504-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=199, 200}}</ref>  Religious historian Elaine Pagels criticizes Irenaeus for describing Gnostic groups as sexual libertines, for example, when some of their own writings advocated chastity more strongly than did orthodox texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gnostc Gospels|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=90}}</ref> However, the Nag Hammadi texts do not present a single, coherent picture of any unified Gnostc system of belief, but rather divergent beliefs of multiple Gnostic sects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lost Christianities|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-518249-1|location=Oxford|pages=122}}</ref> Some of these sects were indeed libertine because they considered bodily existence meaningless; others praised chastity, and strongly prohibited any sexual activity, even within marriage.<ref>Stark, Rodney. ''Cities of God'', HarperCollins, 2007. chap. 6</ref>\n\nIrenaeus also wrote ''The Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching'' (also known as ''Proof of the Apostolic Preaching''), an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] copy of which was discovered in 1904.

Both [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] freely drew on his writings. However, none of his works aside from ''Against Heresies'' and ''The Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching'' survive today, perhaps because his literal hope of an earthly [[Chiliasm|millennium]] may have made him uncongenial reading in the [[Greek East]].<ref>Henry Chadwick, ''The Early Church'', Penguin Group, 1993<sup>2</sup>, p. 83</ref> Even though no complete version of ''Against Heresies'' in its original Greek exists, we possess the full ancient Latin version, probably of the third century, as well as thirty-three fragments of a Syrian version and a complete Armenian version of books 4 and 5.<ref>Richard A Norris, Jr, 'Irenaeus of Lyons', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Louth, eds, ''The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature'', (2010), p47</ref>\n\nIrenaeus' works were first translated into English by [[John Keble]] and published in 1872 as part of the [[Library of the Fathers]] series.\n\n==Scripture==\n{{See also|Development of the New Testament canon}}\nIrenaeus pointed to the public [[rule of faith]], authoritatively articulated by the preaching of bishops and inculcated in Church practice, especially worship, as an authentic apostolic tradition by which to read Scripture truly against heresies. He classified as Scripture not only the Old Testament but most of the books now known as the New Testament,<ref name =\"Oxford\"/> while excluding many works, a large number by Gnostics, that flourished in the 2nd century and claimed scriptural authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-3559/Saint-Irenaeus|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: Saint Irenaeus|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> Oftentimes, Irenaeus, as a student of Polycarp, who was a direct disciple of the Apostle John, believed that he was interpreting scriptures in the same hermeneutic as the Apostles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Hugh|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Saints|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-280058-2|page=250|edition=Fourth}}</ref>  This connection to Jesus was important to Irenaeus because both he and the Gnostics based their arguments on Scripture.  Irenaeus argued that since he could trace his authority to Jesus and the Gnostics could not, his interpretation of Scripture was correct.<ref>J.T.

He felt it important, however, also to speak of a succession of elders (presbyters).<ref>''Against Heresies'', IV.26.2.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus' point when refuting the Gnostics was that all of the Apostolic churches had preserved the same traditions and teachings in many independent streams. It was the unanimous agreement between these many independent streams of transmission that proved the orthodox faith, current in those churches, to be true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103433.htm|title=Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 33:8)|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Irenaeus' theology and contrast with Gnosticism==\nThe central point of Irenaeus' [[theology]] is the unity and the goodness of [[God]], in opposition to the Gnostics' theory of God; a number of divine emanations [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|(Aeons)]] along with a distinction between the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] and the [[Demiurge]]. Irenaeus uses the [[Logos]] theology he inherited from [[Justin Martyr]]. Irenaeus was a student of [[Polycarp]], who was said to have been tutored by [[John the Apostle]].<ref name=p368 /> (John had used Logos terminology in the [[Gospel of John]] and the letter of [[1 John]]). Irenaeus prefers to speak of the Son and the Spirit as the \"hands of God\".\n\n===The Unity of Salvation History===\nIrenaeus' emphasis on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding emphasis on the unity of [[salvation]] history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened is part of his plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures to take a long time to grow into or assume the divine likeness.\n\nEverything that has happened since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed [[Jonah]]: it was only in the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as [[evil]]s, but without them we could never come to know God.\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, the high point in salvation history is the advent of [[Jesus]]. For Irenaeus, the Incarnation of [[Christ]] was intended by God before he determined that humanity would be created.  Irenaeus develops this idea based on [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A14&version=NRSVCE Rom. 5:14], saying \"Forinasmuch as He had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.22.3.</ref> Some theologians maintain that Irenaeus believed that Incarnation would have occurred even if humanity had never sinned; but the fact that they did [[sin]] determined his role as the [[wiktionary:savior|savior]].<ref>J.B. Carol, ''Why Jesus Christ?: Thomistic, Scotistic, and Conciliatory Perspectives'' (Manassas, VA: Trinity Communications, 1986), p. 172\u2013174.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus sees Christ as the new Adam, who systematically ''undoes'' what Adam did: thus, where Adam was disobedient concerning God's edict concerning the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], Christ was obedient even to death on the wood of a tree. Irenaeus is the first to draw comparisons between [[Eve]] and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], contrasting the faithlessness of the former with the faithfulness of the latter. In addition to reversing the wrongs done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as \"recapitulating\" or \"summing up\" human life.<ref>AH 3.18.7; 3.21.9\u201310; 3.22.3; 5.21.1; see also, Klager, Andrew P. \"Retaining and Reclaiming the Divine: Identification and the Recapitulation of Peace in St. Irenaeus of Lyons' Atonement Narrative,\" ''Stricken by God? Nonviolent Identification and the Victory of Christ'', eds. Brad Jersak and Michael Hardin. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), esp. p. 462 n. 158.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus conceives of our salvation as essentially coming about through the [[incarnation]] of God as a man. He characterizes the penalty for sin as death and [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]]. God, however, is [[Immortality|immortal]] and incorruptible, and simply by becoming united to human nature in Christ he conveys those qualities to us: they spread, as it were, like a benign infection.<ref>M David Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange: Irenaeus and Eastern Valentinians on the Soteriology of Interchange,\" ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' p. 324\u2013325.</ref> Irenaeus emphasizes that salvation occurs through Christ's Incarnation, which bestows incorruptibility on humanity, rather than emphasizing His Redemptive death in the [[crucifixion]], although the latter event is an integral part of the former.<ref>Andrew J. Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: A Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus,\" ''Calvin Theological Journal'' 5 (1970): pp. 47, 57.</ref>\n\n====Christ's Life====\nPart of the process of recapitulation is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity. Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until he was older than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyon simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  as per the Jewish custom of periodization on life, and so touches the beginning of old age when one becomes 50 years old. (see [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis#Main arguments|Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22]]).\n\nIn the passage of ''Adversus Haereses'' under consideration, Irenaeus is clear that after receiving baptism at the age of thirty, citing Luke 3:23, Gnostics then falsely assert that \"He [Jesus] preached only one year reckoning from His baptism,\" and also, \"On completing His thirtieth year He [Jesus] suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age.\" Irenaeus argues against the Gnostics by using scripture to add several years after his baptism by referencing 3 distinctly separate visits to Jerusalem.  The first is when Jesus makes wine out of water, he goes up to the Paschal feast-day, after which he withdraws and is found in Samaria. The second is when Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for Passover and cures the paralytic, after which he withdraws over the sea of Tiberias. The third mention is when he travels to Jerusalem, eats the Passover, and suffers on the following day.<ref name=\"A.H. 2.22.5\">A.H. 2.22.5</ref>\n\nIrenaeus quotes scripture, which we reference as John 8:57, to suggest that Jesus ministers while in his 40s. In this passage, Jesus' opponents want to argue that Jesus has not seen Abraham, because Jesus is too young. Jesus' opponents argue that Jesus is not yet 50 years old. Irenaeus argues that if Jesus was in his thirties, his opponents would've argued that He's not yet 40 years, since that would make Him even younger.  Irenaeus' argument is that they would not weaken their own argument by adding years to Jesus' age. Irenaeus also writes that \"The Elders witness to this, who in Asia conferred with John the Lord's disciple, to the effect that John had delivered these things unto them: for he abode with them until the times of Trajan.  And some of them saw not only John, but others also of the Apostles, and had this same account from them, and witness to the aforesaid relation.\"<ref name=\"A.H. 2.22.5\"/>\n\nIn Demonstration (74) Irenaeus notes \"For [[Pontius Pilate]] was governor of [[Judea (Roman province)|Jud\u00e6a]], and he had at that time resentful enmity against [[Herod Antipas|Herod the king of the Jews]]. But then, when Christ was brought to him bound, Pilate sent Him to Herod, giving command to enquire of him, that he might know of a certainty what he should desire concerning Him; making Christ a convenient occasion of reconciliation with the king.\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html Irenaeus, ''Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching'' \u00a777]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504002038/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html |date=May 4, 2011 }}</ref> Pilate was the [[Prefect#Prefects as provincial governors|prefect]] of the Roman province of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] from AD 26\u201336.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460341/Pontius-Pilate |title=Britannica Online: Pontius Pilate |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=https://www.livius.org/jo-jz/judaea/judaea.htm |title=Judaea |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> He served under Emperor [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius Nero]].

Irenaeus first brings up the theme of victory over sin and evil that is afforded by Jesus's death. God's intervention has saved humanity from the Fall of Adam and the wickedness of Satan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bandstra|first1=Andrew|title=Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: a Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus|journal=Calvin Theological Journal|date=April 1, 1970|volume=5|issue=1|page=48}}</ref> Human nature has become joined with God's in the person of Jesus, thus allowing human nature to have victory over sin.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7</ref> Paul writes on the same theme, that Christ has come so that a new order is formed, and being under the Law, is being under the sin of Adam [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=NRSV Rom. 6:14], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal+5%3A18&version=NRSV Gal. 5:18].\n\nReconciliation is also a theme of Paul's that Irenaeus stresses in his teachings on Salvation. Irenaeus believes Jesus coming in flesh and blood sanctified humanity so that it might again reflect the perfection associated with the likeness of the Divine. This perfection leads to a new life, in the lineage of God, which is forever striving for eternal life and unity with the Father.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1</ref><ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.19.1</ref> This is a carryover from Paul, who attributes this reconciliation to the actions of Christ: \"For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ\" [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+15%3A21-2&version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:21\u201322].\n\nA third theme in both Paul's and Irenaeus's conceptions of salvation is the sacrifice of Christ being necessary for the new life given to humanity in the triumph over evil. It is in this obedient sacrifice that Jesus is victor and reconciler, thus erasing the marks that Adam left on human nature. To argue against the Gnostics on this point, Irenaeus uses Colossians [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col+2%3A13-4&version=NRSV Col. 2:13\u20134] in showing that the debt which came by a tree has been paid for us in another tree. Furthermore, the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7&version=NRSV first chapter of Ephesians] is picked up in Irenaeus's discussion of the topic when he asserts, \"By His own blood He redeemed us, as also His apostle declares, 'In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins.'\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.2.2</ref>\n\nIrenaeus does not simply parrot back the message of Paul in his understanding of salvation. One of the major changes that Irenaeus makes is when the [[Parousia]] will occur.  Paul states that he believes that it was going to happen soon, probably in his own lifetime [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thess+4%3A15&version=NRSV 1 Thess. 4:15] [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+15%3A51-2&version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:51\u201352]. However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith. For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased. On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God's will. Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Jeff|title=The Haste of Sin, the Slowness of Salvation: An Interpretation of Irenaeus on the Fall and Redemption|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=89|issue=3|page=444}}</ref> This rather slower version of salvation is not something that Irenaeus received from Paul, but was a necessary construct given the delay of the second coming of Jesus.\n\nThe frequencies of quotations and allusions to the Pauline Epistles in ''Against Heresies'' are:<ref name=grant>Grant, Robert M.

Irenaeus uses this parallel to demonstrate that Christ truly took human flesh.  Irenaeus considered it important to emphasize this point because he understands the failure to recognize Christ's full humanity the bond linking the various strains of Gnosticism together, as seen in his statement that \"according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh.\" <ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.11.3.</ref>  Irenaeus believes that unless the Word became flesh, humans were not fully redeemed.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 312\u2013313.</ref> He explains that by becoming man, Christ restored humanity to being in the image and likeness of God, which they had lost in the [[Fall of man]].<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1.</ref><ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.2.</ref>  Just as Adam was the original head of humanity through whom all sinned, Christ is the new head of humanity who fulfills Adam's role in the [[Economy of Salvation]].<ref>Nielsen, ''Adam and Christ in the Theology of Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 11.</ref>  Irenaeus calls this process of restoring humanity recapitulation.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.2.</ref>\n\nFor Irenaeus, Paul's presentation of the Old Law (the [[Mosaic covenant]]) in this passage indicates that the Old Law revealed humanity's sinfulness but could not save them.  He explains that \"For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.</ref>  Since humans have a physical nature, they cannot be saved by a spiritual law.  Instead, they need a human Savior.  This is why it was necessary for Christ to take human flesh.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Irenaeus summarizes how Christ's taking human flesh saves humanity with a statement that closely resembles [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+5%3A19&version=RSVCE Romans 5:19], \"For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.</ref>  The physical creation of Adam and Christ is emphasized by Irenaeus to demonstrate how the Incarnation saves humanity's physical nature.<ref>Dominic J. Unger and Irenaeus M.C. Steenberg trans. ''St Irenaeus of Lyons: Against the Heresies III'', Ancient Christian Writers: The Works of the Fathers in Translation (New York: The Newman Press, 2012), p. 176\u2013177, endnote 48.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus emphasizes the importance of Christ's reversal of Adam's action. Through His obedience, Christ undoes Adam's disobedience.<ref>Andrew J. Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter,\" p. 50.</ref>  Irenaeus presents the Passion as the climax of Christ's obedience, emphasizing how this obedience on the tree of the Cross [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A8&version=RSVCE Phil. 2:8] undoes the disobedience that occurred through a tree [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&version=RSVCE Gen. 3:17].<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.3.</ref>\nIrenaeus' interpretation of Paul's discussion of Christ as the New Adam is significant because it helped develop the [[recapitulation theory of atonement]]. Irenaeus emphasizes that it is through Christ's reversal of Adam's action that humanity is saved, rather than considering the Redemption to occur in a cultic or juridical way.<ref>Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter,\" p. 61.</ref><ref>For other theories of atonement see [[Atonement in Christianity]].</ref>\n\nThe biblical passage, \"Death has been swallowed up in victory\" ({{bibleref|1 Cor|15:54}}), implied for Irenaeus that the Lord will surely resurrect the first human, i.e. Adam, as one of the saved. According to Irenaeus, those who deny Adam's salvation are \u201cshutting themselves out from life for ever\u201d and the first one who did so was [[Tatian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103323.htm|title=Irenaeus, Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 23)|publisher=paragraph 7.-8. |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> The notion that the [[Last Adam|Second Adam]] saved the first Adam was advocated not only by Irenaeus, but also by [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0610.htm|title=Gregory Thaumaturgus, On All the Saints|publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> which suggests that it was popular in [[Early Christianity|the Early Church]].\n\n===Valentinian Gnosticism===\nValentinian Gnosticism was one of the major forms of Gnosticism that Irenaeus opposed.\n\nAccording to the Gnostic view of Salvation, creation was perfect to begin with; it did not need time to grow and mature. For the Valentinians, the material world is the result of the loss of perfection which resulted from [[Sophia (wisdom)#Valentinus|Sophia's]] desire to understand the Forefather. Therefore, one is ultimately redeemed, through secret knowledge, to enter the [[pleroma]] of which the Achamoth originally fell.\n\nAccording to the Valentinian Gnostics, there are three classes of human beings. They are the material, who cannot attain salvation; the psychic, who are strengthened by works and faith (they are part of the church); and the spiritual, who cannot decay or be harmed by material actions.<ref>Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'' (Routledge, 1997), p. 23.</ref>\nEssentially, ordinary humans\u2014those who have faith but do not possess the special knowledge\u2014will not attain salvation. Spirituals, on the other hand\u2014those who obtain this great gift\u2014are the only class that will eventually attain salvation.\n\nIn his article entitled \"The Demiurge\", J.P. Arendzen sums up the Valentinian view of the salvation of man. He writes, \"The first, or carnal men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or psychic men, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (pleroma) nor hell (whyle); the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the pleroma divested of body (h\u00fale) and soul (psuch\u00e9).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Demiurge|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn this understanding of salvation, the purpose of the Incarnation was to redeem the Spirituals from their material bodies.  By taking a material body, the Son becomes the Savior and facilitates this entrance into the pleroma by making it possible for the Spirituals to receive his spiritual body.  However, in becoming a body and soul, the Son Himself becomes one of those needing redemption.  Therefore, the Word descends onto the Savior at His Baptism in the Jordan, which liberates the Son from his corruptible body and soul.  His redemption from the body and soul is then applied to the Spirituals.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 316\u2013317.</ref>  In response to this Gnostic view of Christ, Irenaeus emphasized that the Word became flesh and developed a soteriology that emphasized the significance of Christ's material Body in saving humanity, as discussed in the sections above.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 313\u2013316.</ref>\n\nIn his criticism of Gnosticism, Irenaeus made reference to a Gnostic gospel which portrayed [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in a positive light, as having acted in accordance with Jesus' instructions. The recently discovered [[Gospel of Judas]] dates close to the period when Irenaeus lived (late 2nd century), and scholars typically regard this work as one of many Gnostic texts, showing one of many varieties of Gnostic beliefs of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyanglicans.net/images/uploads/indepth/A_Spectators_Guide_to_the_Gospel_of_Judas.pdf|title=A Spectators Guide to the Gospel of Judas|author=Dr. John Dickson|publisher=Sydneyanglicans.net|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Prophetic exegesis==\nThe first four books of ''Against Heresies'' constitute a minute analysis and refutation of the Gnostic doctrines. The fifth is a statement of positive belief contrasting the constantly shifting and contradictory Gnostic opinions with the steadfast faith of the church. He appeals to the Biblical prophecies to demonstrate the truthfulness of Christianity.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=244}}\n\n===Rome and the ten horns===\nIrenaeus showed a close relationship between the predicted events of [[Nebuchadnezzar's statue vision in Daniel 2|Daniel 2]] and [[Daniel's Vision of Chapter 7|7]]. Rome, the fourth prophetic kingdom, would end in a tenfold partition. The ten divisions of the empire are the \"ten horns\" of Daniel 7 and the \"ten horns\" in Revelation 17. A \"little horn,\" which was to supplant three of Rome's ten divisions, was also the still future \"eighth\" in Revelation. Irenaeus concluded with the destruction of all kingdoms at the [[Second Coming|Second Advent]], when Christ, the prophesied \"stone,\" cut out of the mountain without hands, smote the image after Rome's division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103526.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 26|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=245}}\n\n===Antichrist===\n{{see also|References to the Antichrist in ecclesiastical writings#Early Church}}\nIrenaeus identified the [[Antichrist]], another name of the apostate [[Man of Sin]], with [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]'s Little Horn and [[John the Apostle|John]]'s [[Beast of Revelation]] 13. He sought to apply other expressions to the Antichrist, such as \"the abomination of desolation,\" mentioned by Christ (Matt. 24:15) and the \"king of a most fierce countenance,\" in [[Gabriel]]'s explanation of the Little Horn of [[Daniel 8]]. But he is not very clear how \"the sacrifice and the libation shall be taken away\" during the \"half-week,\" or three and one-half years of the [[Antichrist's reign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103528.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 28|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25, sec. 2\u20134|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nUnder the notion that the Antichrist, as a single individual, might be of Jewish origin, he fancies that the mention of \"[[Dan (Bible)|Dan]],\" in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 8:16, and the omission of that name from those tribes listed in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 7, might indicate the Antichrist's tribe.

Hence, he applies Biblical and traditional ideas to his descriptions of this earth during the millennium, throughout the closing chapters of Book 5. This conception of the reign of resurrected and translated saints with Christ on this earth during the millennium-popularly known as chiliasm\u2014was the increasingly prevailing belief of this time. Incipient distortions due to the admixture of current traditions, which figure in the extreme forms of chiliasm, caused a reaction against the earlier interpretations of Bible prophecies.{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=250\u2013252}}\n\nIrenaeus was not looking for a Jewish kingdom.

He tells, for instance, of a prodigious fertility of this earth during the millennium, after the resurrection of the righteous, \"when also the creation, having been renovated and set free, shall fructify with an abundance of all kinds of food.\" In this connection, he attributes to Christ the saying about the vine with ten thousand branches, and the ear of wheat with ten thousand grains, and so forth, which he quotes from [[Papias of Hierapolis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103533.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 33, sec. 3|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=251}}\n\n===Rapture===\nOften Irenaeus is grouped with other early church fathers as teaching historic [[premillennialism]] which maintain a belief in the earthly reign of Christ but differ from dispensational premillennialism in their view of the [[rapture]] as to when the translation of saints occurs. In  Against Heresies (V.XXIX.1) he says \"And therefore, when in the end the Church shall be suddenly caught up from this, it is said, 'There shall be tribulation such as has not been since the beginning, neither shall be.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103529.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 39, sec. 1|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n===Exegesis===\nIrenaeus' exegesis does not give complete coverage.

This is the evidence used to assume that Irenaeus was born in Smyrna during the 130s\u2013140s.</ref> Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was brought up in a Christian family rather than converting as an adult.\n\nDuring the persecution of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the [[Roman Emperor]] from 161\u2013180, Irenaeus was a priest of the Church of Lyon. The clergy of that city, many of whom were suffering imprisonment for the faith, sent him in 177 to Rome with a letter to [[Pope Eleutherius]] concerning the heresy of [[Montanism]], and that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits. While Irenaeus was in Rome, a persecution took place in Lyon. Returning to Gaul, Irenaeus succeeded the [[martyr]] [[Saint Pothinus]] and became the second [[Bishop of Lyon]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.4.1</ref>\n\nDuring the religious peace which followed the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies''). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may have taken place in Asia Minor or in Rome.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', 1.pr.2, 4.pr.2</ref> However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of '[[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus the Magician]]' living and teaching in the [[Rhone valley]].<ref>Against Heresies 1.13.7</ref>\n\nLittle is known about the career of Irenaeus after he became bishop. The last action reported of him (by [[Eusebius]], 150 years later) is that in 190 or 191, he exerted influence on [[Pope Victor I]] not to excommunicate the Christian communities of Asia Minor which persevered in the practice of the [[Quartodeciman]] celebration of [[Easter]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.24.1ff</ref>\n\nNothing is known of the date of his death, which must have occurred at the end of the second  or the beginning of the third century. He is regarded as a martyr by the  Catholic Church and by some within the Orthodox Church.<ref>[[Gregory of Tours]] is the first to mention a tradition which held Irenaeus to be a martyr</ref>  He was buried under the Church of Saint John in Lyon, which was later renamed St Irenaeus in his honour. The tomb and his remains were utterly destroyed in 1562 by the [[Huguenots]].\n\n==Writings==\nIrenaeus wrote a number of books, but the most important that survives is the ''Against Heresies'' (or, in its [[Latin language|Latin]] title, ''Adversus haereses'').  In Book I, Irenaeus talks about the Valentinian Gnostics and their predecessors, who he says go as far back as the magician [[Simon Magus]].  In Book II he attempts to provide proof that [[Valentinianism]] contains no merit in terms of its doctrines.  In Book III Irenaeus purports to show that these doctrines are false, by providing counter-evidence gleaned from the [[Gospel]]s.  Book IV consists of Jesus' sayings, and here Irenaeus also stresses the unity of the Old Testament and the Gospel.  In the final volume, Book V, Irenaeus focuses on more sayings of Jesus plus the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].<ref>Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 6. Routledge 1997.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus wrote: \"One should not seek among others the truth that can be easily gotten from the Church. For in her, as in a rich treasury, the apostles have placed all that pertains to truth, so that everyone can drink this beverage of life. She is the door of life.\" (Irenaeus of Lyons, ''Against Heresies'', III.4)<ref>[http://www.orthodoxchurchquotes.com/category/sayings-from-saints-elders-and-fathers/st-irenaeus-of-lyon/ \"St. Irenaeus of Lyon\", Orthodox Church Quotes]</ref> But he also said, \"Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice<ref>Most, William G., ''The Holy Spirit and the Church'', Notre Dame Institute Press, 1991, p. 76</ref> Irenaeus recognized that all who feared and loved God, practiced justice and piety towards their neighbors, and desired to see Christ, insofar as they were able to do so, will be saved. Since many were not able to have an explicit desire to see Christ, but only implicit, it is clear that for Irenaeus this is enough.\n\n[[File:POxy405.jpg|thumb|right|Cambridge University library manuscript 4113 / Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 405.  Irenaeus. Ca. 200 AD.]]The purpose of \"Against Heresies\" was to refute the teachings of various Gnostic groups; apparently, several Greek merchants had begun an oratorial campaign in Irenaeus' bishopric, teaching that the material world was the accidental creation of an evil god, from which we are to escape by the pursuit of ''gnosis''.  Irenaeus argued that the true gnosis is in fact knowledge of Christ, which redeems rather than escapes from bodily existence.<ref>source needed</ref>\n\nUntil the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Library of Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, ''Against Heresies'' was the best-surviving description of Gnosticism.

''Beyond Belief'', Pan Books, 2005. p. 54</ref>  However, the general consensus among modern scholars is that Irenaeus was fairly accurate in his transmission of Gnostic beliefs, and that the Nag Hammadi texts have raised no substantial challenges to the overall accuracy of Irenaeus' information.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Orthodoxy and Heresy in Early Christian Contexts: Reconsidering the Bauer Thesis|last=Hartog|first=Paul A.|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61097-504-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=199, 200}}</ref>  Religious historian Elaine Pagels criticizes Irenaeus for describing Gnostic groups as sexual libertines, for example, when some of their own writings advocated chastity more strongly than did orthodox texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Gnostc Gospels|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=90}}</ref> However, the Nag Hammadi texts do not present a single, coherent picture of any unified Gnostc system of belief, but rather divergent beliefs of multiple Gnostic sects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lost Christianities|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-518249-1|location=Oxford|pages=122}}</ref> Some of these sects were indeed libertine because they considered bodily existence meaningless; others praised chastity, and strongly prohibited any sexual activity, even within marriage.<ref>Stark, Rodney.

The Christians of Asia Minor preferred the Gospel of John. The Gospel of Matthew was the most popular overall.<ref name =\"Harris\">[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]],'' Understanding the Bible'' (Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985)</ref> Irenaeus asserted that four Gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], were canonical scripture.<ref>\"But it is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church has been scattered throughout the world, and since the 'pillar and ground' of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life, it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing incorruption on every side, and vivifying human afresh.

[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103426.htm read online].</ref> In a passage that became a ''locus classicus'' of Catholic-Protestant polemics, he cited the Roman church as an example of the unbroken chain of authority, which text Western polemics would use to assert the primacy of Rome over Eastern churches by virtue of its ''preeminent authority''.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-3559/Saint-Irenaeus|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>\"Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the successions of all the Churches, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down to our time by means of the successions of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity that every Church should agree with this Church, on account of its pre- eminent authority, that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the apostolical tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.\"[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103303.htm read online Adversus Haereses (Book III, Chapter 3)]</ref>\n\nWith the lists of bishops to which Irenaeus referred, the doctrine of the apostolic succession of the bishops, firmly established in the Church at this time, could be linked.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"/> This succession was important to establish a chain of custody for orthodoxy.  He felt it important, however, also to speak of a succession of elders (presbyters).<ref>''Against Heresies'', IV.26.2.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus' point when refuting the Gnostics was that all of the Apostolic churches had preserved the same traditions and teachings in many independent streams. It was the unanimous agreement between these many independent streams of transmission that proved the orthodox faith, current in those churches, to be true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103433.htm|title=Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 33:8)|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Irenaeus' theology and contrast with Gnosticism==\nThe central point of Irenaeus' [[theology]] is the unity and the goodness of [[God]], in opposition to the Gnostics' theory of God; a number of divine emanations [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|(Aeons)]] along with a distinction between the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] and the [[Demiurge]]. Irenaeus uses the [[Logos]] theology he inherited from [[Justin Martyr]]. Irenaeus was a student of [[Polycarp]], who was said to have been tutored by [[John the Apostle]].<ref name=p368 /> (John had used Logos terminology in the [[Gospel of John]] and the letter of [[1 John]]). Irenaeus prefers to speak of the Son and the Spirit as the \"hands of God\".\n\n===The Unity of Salvation History===\nIrenaeus' emphasis on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding emphasis on the unity of [[salvation]] history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened is part of his plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures to take a long time to grow into or assume the divine likeness.\n\nEverything that has happened since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed [[Jonah]]: it was only in the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as [[evil]]s, but without them we could never come to know God.\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, the high point in salvation history is the advent of [[Jesus]]. For Irenaeus, the Incarnation of [[Christ]] was intended by God before he determined that humanity would be created.  Irenaeus develops this idea based on [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A14&version=NRSVCE Rom. 5:14], saying \"Forinasmuch as He had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.22.3.</ref> Some theologians maintain that Irenaeus believed that Incarnation would have occurred even if humanity had never sinned; but the fact that they did [[sin]] determined his role as the [[wiktionary:savior|savior]].<ref>J.B. Carol, ''Why Jesus Christ?: Thomistic, Scotistic, and Conciliatory Perspectives'' (Manassas, VA: Trinity Communications, 1986), p. 172\u2013174.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus sees Christ as the new Adam, who systematically ''undoes'' what Adam did: thus, where Adam was disobedient concerning God's edict concerning the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], Christ was obedient even to death on the wood of a tree. Irenaeus is the first to draw comparisons between [[Eve]] and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], contrasting the faithlessness of the former with the faithfulness of the latter. In addition to reversing the wrongs done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as \"recapitulating\" or \"summing up\" human life.<ref>AH 3.18.7; 3.21.9\u201310; 3.22.3; 5.21.1; see also, Klager, Andrew P. \"Retaining and Reclaiming the Divine: Identification and the Recapitulation of Peace in St. Irenaeus of Lyons' Atonement Narrative,\" ''Stricken by God? Nonviolent Identification and the Victory of Christ'', eds. Brad Jersak and Michael Hardin. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), esp. p. 462 n. 158.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus conceives of our salvation as essentially coming about through the [[incarnation]] of God as a man. He characterizes the penalty for sin as death and [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]]. God, however, is [[Immortality|immortal]] and incorruptible, and simply by becoming united to human nature in Christ he conveys those qualities to us: they spread, as it were, like a benign infection.<ref>M David Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange: Irenaeus and Eastern Valentinians on the Soteriology of Interchange,\" ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' p. 324\u2013325.</ref> Irenaeus emphasizes that salvation occurs through Christ's Incarnation, which bestows incorruptibility on humanity, rather than emphasizing His Redemptive death in the [[crucifixion]], although the latter event is an integral part of the former.<ref>Andrew J. Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: A Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus,\" ''Calvin Theological Journal'' 5 (1970): pp. 47, 57.</ref>\n\n====Christ's Life====\nPart of the process of recapitulation is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity. Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until he was older than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyon simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  as per the Jewish custom of periodization on life, and so touches the beginning of old age when one becomes 50 years old. (see [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis#Main arguments|Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22]]).\n\nIn the passage of ''Adversus Haereses'' under consideration, Irenaeus is clear that after receiving baptism at the age of thirty, citing Luke 3:23, Gnostics then falsely assert that \"He [Jesus] preached only one year reckoning from His baptism,\" and also, \"On completing His thirtieth year He [Jesus] suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age.\" Irenaeus argues against the Gnostics by using scripture to add several years after his baptism by referencing 3 distinctly separate visits to Jerusalem.  The first is when Jesus makes wine out of water, he goes up to the Paschal feast-day, after which he withdraws and is found in Samaria. The second is when Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for Passover and cures the paralytic, after which he withdraws over the sea of Tiberias. The third mention is when he travels to Jerusalem, eats the Passover, and suffers on the following day.<ref name=\"A.H. 2.22.5\">A.H. 2.22.5</ref>\n\nIrenaeus quotes scripture, which we reference as John 8:57, to suggest that Jesus ministers while in his 40s. In this passage, Jesus' opponents want to argue that Jesus has not seen Abraham, because Jesus is too young. Jesus' opponents argue that Jesus is not yet 50 years old. Irenaeus argues that if Jesus was in his thirties, his opponents would've argued that He's not yet 40 years, since that would make Him even younger.  Irenaeus' argument is that they would not weaken their own argument by adding years to Jesus' age. Irenaeus also writes that \"The Elders witness to this, who in Asia conferred with John the Lord's disciple, to the effect that John had delivered these things unto them: for he abode with them until the times of Trajan.  And some of them saw not only John, but others also of the Apostles, and had this same account from them, and witness to the aforesaid relation.\"<ref name=\"A.H. 2.22.5\"/>\n\nIn Demonstration (74) Irenaeus notes \"For [[Pontius Pilate]] was governor of [[Judea (Roman province)|Jud\u00e6a]], and he had at that time resentful enmity against [[Herod Antipas|Herod the king of the Jews]]. But then, when Christ was brought to him bound, Pilate sent Him to Herod, giving command to enquire of him, that he might know of a certainty what he should desire concerning Him; making Christ a convenient occasion of reconciliation with the king.\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html Irenaeus, ''Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching'' \u00a777]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504002038/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.preaching_the_demonstration_of_the_apostolic_preaching.html |date=May 4, 2011 }}</ref> Pilate was the [[Prefect#Prefects as provincial governors|prefect]] of the Roman province of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] from AD 26\u201336.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460341/Pontius-Pilate |title=Britannica Online: Pontius Pilate |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=https://www.livius.org/jo-jz/judaea/judaea.htm |title=Judaea |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> He served under Emperor [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius Nero]].

Irenaeus first brings up the theme of victory over sin and evil that is afforded by Jesus's death. God's intervention has saved humanity from the Fall of Adam and the wickedness of Satan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bandstra|first1=Andrew|title=Paul and an Ancient Interpreter: a Comparison of the Teaching of Redemption in Paul and Irenaeus|journal=Calvin Theological Journal|date=April 1, 1970|volume=5|issue=1|page=48}}</ref> Human nature has become joined with God's in the person of Jesus, thus allowing human nature to have victory over sin.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7</ref> Paul writes on the same theme, that Christ has come so that a new order is formed, and being under the Law, is being under the sin of Adam [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14&version=NRSV Rom. 6:14], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal+5%3A18&version=NRSV Gal. 5:18].\n\nReconciliation is also a theme of Paul's that Irenaeus stresses in his teachings on Salvation. Irenaeus believes Jesus coming in flesh and blood sanctified humanity so that it might again reflect the perfection associated with the likeness of the Divine. This perfection leads to a new life, in the lineage of God, which is forever striving for eternal life and unity with the Father.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1</ref><ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.19.1</ref> This is a carryover from Paul, who attributes this reconciliation to the actions of Christ: \"For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ\" [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+15%3A21-2&version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:21\u201322].\n\nA third theme in both Paul's and Irenaeus's conceptions of salvation is the sacrifice of Christ being necessary for the new life given to humanity in the triumph over evil. It is in this obedient sacrifice that Jesus is victor and reconciler, thus erasing the marks that Adam left on human nature. To argue against the Gnostics on this point, Irenaeus uses Colossians [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col+2%3A13-4&version=NRSV Col. 2:13\u20134] in showing that the debt which came by a tree has been paid for us in another tree. Furthermore, the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7&version=NRSV first chapter of Ephesians] is picked up in Irenaeus's discussion of the topic when he asserts, \"By His own blood He redeemed us, as also His apostle declares, 'In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins.'\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.2.2</ref>\n\nIrenaeus does not simply parrot back the message of Paul in his understanding of salvation. One of the major changes that Irenaeus makes is when the [[Parousia]] will occur.  Paul states that he believes that it was going to happen soon, probably in his own lifetime [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thess+4%3A15&version=NRSV 1 Thess. 4:15] [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor+15%3A51-2&version=NRSV 1 Cor. 15:51\u201352]. However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith. For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased. On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God's will. Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=Jeff|title=The Haste of Sin, the Slowness of Salvation: An Interpretation of Irenaeus on the Fall and Redemption|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=89|issue=3|page=444}}</ref> This rather slower version of salvation is not something that Irenaeus received from Paul, but was a necessary construct given the delay of the second coming of Jesus.\n\nThe frequencies of quotations and allusions to the Pauline Epistles in ''Against Heresies'' are:<ref name=grant>Grant, Robert M.

Irenaeus uses this parallel to demonstrate that Christ truly took human flesh.  Irenaeus considered it important to emphasize this point because he understands the failure to recognize Christ's full humanity the bond linking the various strains of Gnosticism together, as seen in his statement that \"according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh.\" <ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.11.3.</ref>  Irenaeus believes that unless the Word became flesh, humans were not fully redeemed.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 312\u2013313.</ref> He explains that by becoming man, Christ restored humanity to being in the image and likeness of God, which they had lost in the [[Fall of man]].<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.1.</ref><ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.2.</ref>  Just as Adam was the original head of humanity through whom all sinned, Christ is the new head of humanity who fulfills Adam's role in the [[Economy of Salvation]].<ref>Nielsen, ''Adam and Christ in the Theology of Irenaeus of Lyons'', p. 11.</ref>  Irenaeus calls this process of restoring humanity recapitulation.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.2.</ref>\n\nFor Irenaeus, Paul's presentation of the Old Law (the [[Mosaic covenant]]) in this passage indicates that the Old Law revealed humanity's sinfulness but could not save them.  He explains that \"For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.</ref>  Since humans have a physical nature, they cannot be saved by a spiritual law.  Instead, they need a human Savior.  This is why it was necessary for Christ to take human flesh.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Irenaeus summarizes how Christ's taking human flesh saves humanity with a statement that closely resembles [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+5%3A19&version=RSVCE Romans 5:19], \"For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation.\"<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III.18.7.</ref>  The physical creation of Adam and Christ is emphasized by Irenaeus to demonstrate how the Incarnation saves humanity's physical nature.<ref>Dominic J. Unger and Irenaeus M.C. Steenberg trans. ''St Irenaeus of Lyons: Against the Heresies III'', Ancient Christian Writers: The Works of the Fathers in Translation (New York: The Newman Press, 2012), p. 176\u2013177, endnote 48.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus emphasizes the importance of Christ's reversal of Adam's action. Through His obedience, Christ undoes Adam's disobedience.<ref>Andrew J. Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter,\" p. 50.</ref>  Irenaeus presents the Passion as the climax of Christ's obedience, emphasizing how this obedience on the tree of the Cross [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil+2%3A8&version=RSVCE Phil. 2:8] undoes the disobedience that occurred through a tree [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A17&version=RSVCE Gen. 3:17].<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', V.16.3.</ref>\nIrenaeus' interpretation of Paul's discussion of Christ as the New Adam is significant because it helped develop the [[recapitulation theory of atonement]]. Irenaeus emphasizes that it is through Christ's reversal of Adam's action that humanity is saved, rather than considering the Redemption to occur in a cultic or juridical way.<ref>Bandstra, \"Paul and an Ancient Interpreter,\" p. 61.</ref><ref>For other theories of atonement see [[Atonement in Christianity]].</ref>\n\nThe biblical passage, \"Death has been swallowed up in victory\" ({{bibleref|1 Cor|15:54}}), implied for Irenaeus that the Lord will surely resurrect the first human, i.e. Adam, as one of the saved. According to Irenaeus, those who deny Adam's salvation are \u201cshutting themselves out from life for ever\u201d and the first one who did so was [[Tatian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103323.htm|title=Irenaeus, Against Heresies (Book III, Chapter 23)|publisher=paragraph 7.-8. |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> The notion that the [[Last Adam|Second Adam]] saved the first Adam was advocated not only by Irenaeus, but also by [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0610.htm|title=Gregory Thaumaturgus, On All the Saints|publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> which suggests that it was popular in [[Early Christianity|the Early Church]].\n\n===Valentinian Gnosticism===\nValentinian Gnosticism was one of the major forms of Gnosticism that Irenaeus opposed.\n\nAccording to the Gnostic view of Salvation, creation was perfect to begin with; it did not need time to grow and mature. For the Valentinians, the material world is the result of the loss of perfection which resulted from [[Sophia (wisdom)#Valentinus|Sophia's]] desire to understand the Forefather. Therefore, one is ultimately redeemed, through secret knowledge, to enter the [[pleroma]] of which the Achamoth originally fell.\n\nAccording to the Valentinian Gnostics, there are three classes of human beings. They are the material, who cannot attain salvation; the psychic, who are strengthened by works and faith (they are part of the church); and the spiritual, who cannot decay or be harmed by material actions.<ref>Grant, Robert M., ''Irenaeus of Lyons'' (Routledge, 1997), p. 23.</ref>\nEssentially, ordinary humans\u2014those who have faith but do not possess the special knowledge\u2014will not attain salvation. Spirituals, on the other hand\u2014those who obtain this great gift\u2014are the only class that will eventually attain salvation.\n\nIn his article entitled \"The Demiurge\", J.P. Arendzen sums up the Valentinian view of the salvation of man. He writes, \"The first, or carnal men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or psychic men, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (pleroma) nor hell (whyle); the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the pleroma divested of body (h\u00fale) and soul (psuch\u00e9).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Demiurge|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn this understanding of salvation, the purpose of the Incarnation was to redeem the Spirituals from their material bodies.  By taking a material body, the Son becomes the Savior and facilitates this entrance into the pleroma by making it possible for the Spirituals to receive his spiritual body.  However, in becoming a body and soul, the Son Himself becomes one of those needing redemption.  Therefore, the Word descends onto the Savior at His Baptism in the Jordan, which liberates the Son from his corruptible body and soul.  His redemption from the body and soul is then applied to the Spirituals.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 316\u2013317.</ref>  In response to this Gnostic view of Christ, Irenaeus emphasized that the Word became flesh and developed a soteriology that emphasized the significance of Christ's material Body in saving humanity, as discussed in the sections above.<ref>Litwa, \"The Wondrous Exchange,\" p. 313\u2013316.</ref>\n\nIn his criticism of Gnosticism, Irenaeus made reference to a Gnostic gospel which portrayed [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in a positive light, as having acted in accordance with Jesus' instructions. The recently discovered [[Gospel of Judas]] dates close to the period when Irenaeus lived (late 2nd century), and scholars typically regard this work as one of many Gnostic texts, showing one of many varieties of Gnostic beliefs of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyanglicans.net/images/uploads/indepth/A_Spectators_Guide_to_the_Gospel_of_Judas.pdf|title=A Spectators Guide to the Gospel of Judas|author=Dr. John Dickson|publisher=Sydneyanglicans.net|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Prophetic exegesis==\nThe first four books of ''Against Heresies'' constitute a minute analysis and refutation of the Gnostic doctrines. The fifth is a statement of positive belief contrasting the constantly shifting and contradictory Gnostic opinions with the steadfast faith of the church. He appeals to the Biblical prophecies to demonstrate the truthfulness of Christianity.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=244}}\n\n===Rome and the ten horns===\nIrenaeus showed a close relationship between the predicted events of [[Nebuchadnezzar's statue vision in Daniel 2|Daniel 2]] and [[Daniel's Vision of Chapter 7|7]]. Rome, the fourth prophetic kingdom, would end in a tenfold partition. The ten divisions of the empire are the \"ten horns\" of Daniel 7 and the \"ten horns\" in Revelation 17. A \"little horn,\" which was to supplant three of Rome's ten divisions, was also the still future \"eighth\" in Revelation. Irenaeus concluded with the destruction of all kingdoms at the [[Second Coming|Second Advent]], when Christ, the prophesied \"stone,\" cut out of the mountain without hands, smote the image after Rome's division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103526.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 26|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=245}}\n\n===Antichrist===\n{{see also|References to the Antichrist in ecclesiastical writings#Early Church}}\nIrenaeus identified the [[Antichrist]], another name of the apostate [[Man of Sin]], with [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]'s Little Horn and [[John the Apostle|John]]'s [[Beast of Revelation]] 13. He sought to apply other expressions to the Antichrist, such as \"the abomination of desolation,\" mentioned by Christ (Matt. 24:15) and the \"king of a most fierce countenance,\" in [[Gabriel]]'s explanation of the Little Horn of [[Daniel 8]]. But he is not very clear how \"the sacrifice and the libation shall be taken away\" during the \"half-week,\" or three and one-half years of the [[Antichrist's reign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103528.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 28|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103525.htm|title=''Against Heresies'' Book 5 Chapter 25, sec. 2\u20134|publisher=Newadvent.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nUnder the notion that the Antichrist, as a single individual, might be of Jewish origin, he fancies that the mention of \"[[Dan (Bible)|Dan]],\" in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 8:16, and the omission of that name from those tribes listed in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 7, might indicate the Antichrist's tribe.

Hence, he applies Biblical and traditional ideas to his descriptions of this earth during the millennium, throughout the closing chapters of Book 5. This conception of the reign of resurrected and translated saints with Christ on this earth during the millennium-popularly known as chiliasm\u2014was the increasingly prevailing belief of this time.

It takes place mainly in [[Derbyshire]] (though it starts in [[Yorkshire]] and, near the end, makes a short detour into [[Cheshire]]), in northern [[England]]. It is organised by [[the Scout Association]]. It is a competitive event, without an overnight camp (although teams must be equipped to [[bivouac shelter|bivouac]] if the conditions are severe enough to warrant it). It was first held as a [[Rover Scout]] event in 1957, but is now open to other teams of experienced hill walkers and [[Fell running|fell runners]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe event is undertaken in teams of three or four, for safety reasons, and at least two of these team members must be at least 17 (the others may be 16) on the day of the event. An amount of equipment must be carried by the team, including [[survival bag]]s, [[emergency rations]], a [[first-aid kit]], and a group shelter. Any member of a team is allowed to drop out at any point, but the rest of the team will not be permitted to continue the event unless they are in a group of not less than 3, or more than 7 people (which can be formed by combining two groups together). The remaining team members must still carry all of the safety equipment.  Any team that has not reached the checkpoint at [[Chapel-en-le-Frith]] before 21:15 will not be allowed to complete the rest of the event.  No dogs are allowed to accompany the walkers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fourinnswalk.org/docs/info |title=Four Inns Walking Information |access-date=2008-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528010245/http://www.fourinnswalk.org/docs/info |archive-date=2009-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Route==\nThe 40-mile (65&nbsp;km) hike starts at the local church of [[Holmbridge]].

Next, it passes through Hey Moss, Crowden, Tor Side, [[Bleaklow]], and Doctor's Gate to the '[[Snake Pass|Snake (Pass) Inn]]'. The next checkpoint is over the [[Kinder Scout|Kinder]] plateau to the 'Nag's Head' Inn in [[Edale]].

The youngest was a member of the 32nd Huddersfield (Dalton) Rover Crew. The two older were from the Birmingham University Rover Crew. Travelling lightly laden and without support, they were overtaken by deteriorating weather, including 30&nbsp;mph winds, heavy rain, and temperatures from 0 to 7&nbsp;\u00b0C above the Snake Pass. The youngest of the group got into trouble in the upper reaches of the Alport Valley. One of his team members summoned help and he was brought down to Alport Castles Farm by the Glossop Rover Crew. He was taken to hospital but died later. The other two scouts who died were in a separate team, but in the same area. A third member of that team was found in the Alport and taken to safety, but he was unable to give accurate information about where the rest of the team were. Because of the worsening weather, the search had to be called off during the night, but it was resumed on Sunday morning. However, it was not until Monday afternoon that the first body was recovered.

Joseph at the time was not a well-known actor, was twice Elizabeth's age, and had two illegitimate sons. Elizabeth and Joseph did not have children together. The marriage was reported to have had difficulties. Elizabeth and Joseph appeared on the stage together for the first time on 4 September 1772 in [[William Shakespeare|Shakepeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]].'' In October 1772, the couple toured Scotland with [[West Digges]]'s theatre company, a demanding life for nearly four years. In 1776, the couple made a move to France, where Joseph went to learn to paint and Elizabeth went to study the French language. In only one month, the couple became penniless. They moved to Liverpool and Inchbald met actors [[Sarah Siddons]] and her brother [[John Philip Kemble]], both of whom became important friends after joining Joseph Younger's company. The Inchbalds subsequently moved to Canterbury and Yorkshire. In 1777, the couple was then hired by [[Tate Wilkinson]]'s company.\n\nAfter Joseph Inchbald's unexpected death in June 1779, Inchbald continued to act for several years, in Dublin, London, and elsewhere.

Although Austen's book brought more fame to Inchbald, ''Lovers' Vows'' ran for forty-two nights when it was originally performed in 1798.<ref name=\"McMaster University\"/> Not only were her plays well liked, but her famous novel ''A Simple Story'' always received praise.
