an [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[smartphone]] unveiled, produced, released and marketed by [[Samsung Electronics]] as part of the [[Samsung Galaxy S series]]. Unveiled on 24 February 2014 at [[Mobile World Congress]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], it was released on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries as the immediate successor to the [[Galaxy S4]]. As with the S4, the S5 is an evolution of the prior year's model, placing a particular emphasis on an improved build with a textured rear cover and [[IP Code|IP67]] certification for dust and water resistance, a more refined user experience, new security features such as a fingerprint reader and private mode, expanded health features (such as a built-in heart rate monitor), and an updated camera.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 received mostly positive reviews; the phone was praised for its display, hardware, camera, long battery life, and incorporating water resistance while retaining a removable battery and MicroSD slot.<ref>[https://mobilesyrup.com/2014/11/30/the-samsung-galaxy-s5-is-the-best-boring-android-smartphone/]</ref> However, the S5 was criticized for [[Software bloat|bloated software]], the inconsistent [[fingerprint scanner]] featured on the phone, and its plastic design in light of rival smartphones' more premium metal bodies.<ref name=engadget-review/><ref name=guardian-fphacked/><ref name=verge-review/> Added a ringtone, [[Congratulations (PewDiePie, Roomie and Boyinaband song)|Congratulations]], the only songs as a ringtone, released by [[Sweden|Swedish]] YouTuber [[PewDiePie]], Swedish singer/musician Roomie and [[English people|English]] musician [[Boyinaband]].\n\nIn August 2015, following the release of its then-latest flagship, the [[Galaxy S6]], Samsung released an updated version called the \"Galaxy S5 Neo\" which has an Exynos 7 Octa (7580) processor clocked at 1.6&nbsp; GHz. It has 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal storage and comes with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Lollipop|5.0.2 \"Lollipop\"]].\n\n== Release date ==\nThe Galaxy S5 was unveiled on 24 February 2014 as part of the company's presentation at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung Electronics president JK Shin explained that consumers did not want a phone dependent on [[Bleeding edge technology|\"eye-popping\" or \"complex\" technology]], but one with \"beautiful design and performance\", a \"simple, yet powerful camera\", \"faster and seamless connectivity\", and fitness-oriented features.<ref name=cnet-s5unveil>{{cite web|title=Galaxy S5 unveiled with fingerprint sensor, bigger screen|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-s5-unveiled-with-fingerprint-sensor-bigger-screen/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSamsung announced that it would release the S5 on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries\u2014including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].<ref name=\"releasedate\">{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/samsung-galaxy-s5-launching-on-april-11-in-150-countries/ | title=Samsung Galaxy S5 launching on April 11th in 150 countries | work=Engadget |publisher=AOL | date=24 February 2012 | accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> On 18 June 2014, Samsung unveiled an [[LTE-Advanced]] version of the S5, exclusively released in [[South Korea]].

Both Samsung and Verizon confirmed the issue, which affected a limited number of Galaxy S5 devices; Samsung instructed users affected by the bug to contact the company or their carrier to have their phone replaced under warranty.<ref name=tr-camerafailed>{{cite web|title=Samsung confirms Galaxy S5 camera issues|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/verizon-galaxy-s5-camera-issues-leave-owners-sol-1244995|website=TechRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=verge-camerafailed>{{cite web|title=Samsung confirms fatal camera flaw on 'limited number' of Galaxy S5 smartphones|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/25/5653192/samsung-confirms-fatal-galaxy-s5-camera-problem|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications==\n\n===Hardware and design===\n==== Changes ====\n[[File: Samsung Galaxy S5.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of an \"Electric Blue\" Galaxy S5, showing the textured rear, camera, and heart rate sensor]]\nThe design of the S5 evolves upon the design of the S4. It features a rounded, [[polycarbonate]] [[chassis]] carrying a \"modern glam\" look, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover. Unlike past models, the S5's rear cover uses a higher quality soft plastic and is dimpled to improve grip. The S5 is [[IP67]] certified for dust and water resistance. As such, the phone is able to be submerged in water up to {{convert|1|m|ft}} for up to 30 minutes. The S5's [[Micro-USB]] [[USB 3.0|3.0]] port uses a removable cover. The S5 is available in Charcoal Black, Electric Blue, Copper Gold, and Shimmery White color finishes. The S5's screen is a {{Convert|5.1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[1080p]] [[Super AMOLED]] panel, which is slightly larger than that of the S4, and allows for automatic brightness and [[gamut]] adjustments.<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/>\n\n==== Front panel ====\nBelow the screen are three buttons. The physical \"Home\" button in the centre contains a swipe-based [[fingerprint scanner]]. The \"Recent apps\" and \"Back\" buttons are capacitive. In accordance with Android 4.0 human interface guidelines, the S5 no longer uses a \"Menu\" key like its predecessors, although its button layout is still reversed in comparison to other Android devices with the S5's button layout (such as the [[HTC One X]] and [[Galaxy Nexus]], whose \"Back\" buttons are to the left of \"Home\").<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/><ref name=\"anandtech-onereview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/6747/htc-one-review | title=The HTC One Review | last=Klug | first=Brian | publisher=AnandTech Inc. | work=AnandTech | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502210403/http://anandtech.com/show/6747/htc-one-review | archivedate=2 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=5 April 2013 | accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe S5 includes a 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing camera, which offers [[4K resolution|4K (2160p)]] video recording at 30[[framerate|fps]], phase detection [[autofocus]] (which Samsung claims to be able to focus in around 0.3&nbsp;seconds),<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/> real-time [[High-dynamic-range imaging|HDR]] photos and video (of which the latter is available for the first time in a Samsung flagship mobile devie), and an [[image sensor]] with Samsung's \"[[Isocell]]\" technology, which isolates the individual pixels inside the sensor to improve its ability to capture light and reduce crosstalk. Compared to conventional BSI sensors, this reduces electrical crosstalk by about 30 percent.<ref>[http://connect.dpreview.com/post/0315472077/samsung-explains-the-galaxy-s5-isocell-sensor Samsung Explains the Galaxy S5 Isocell Sensor]</ref>\nThe camera is also able to record 1080p@60fps for smoother [[slow motion#realtime|real-time]] playback.

It has Samsung's [[TouchWiz]] software, which for the S5 has a flatter, more geometric look than that found on the S4. Certain aspects of the changes were influenced by a recent patent licensing deal with [[Google]], which requires that Samsung's TouchWiz interface follow the design of \"stock\" Android more closely.

The S5 Neo is a lower cost variant of the original Galaxy S5 that downgrades the SoC to an Exynos 7580 Octa system-on-chip, while improving the front camera to a 5-megapixel unit. Other changes include the removal of a fingerprint sensor and a conventional USB 2.0 port in lieu of a USB 3.0 port with a water-resistant cover, the latter of which had been a source of complaints from users who found the cover was easily broken from regular use, compared to the previous year's model.

The back cover has no more glossy polycarbonate and has a new dot pattern, similar to the Google Nexus 7-2012.}} and for not using higher quality materials such as metal or a higher-quality plastic.

''[[TechRadar]]'' also noticed that, despite the high power of its processor, some apps and interface functions suffered from performance issues, indicating that the S5's operating system may not have been completely optimized for its system-on-chip.

an [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[smartphone]] unveiled, produced, released and marketed by [[Samsung Electronics]] as part of the [[Samsung Galaxy S series]]. Unveiled on 24 February 2014 at [[Mobile World Congress]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], it was released on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries as the immediate successor to the [[Galaxy S4]]. As with the S4, the S5 is an evolution of the prior year's model, placing a particular emphasis on an improved build with a textured rear cover and [[IP Code|IP67]] certification for dust and water resistance, a more refined user experience, new security features such as a fingerprint reader and private mode, expanded health features (such as a built-in heart rate monitor), and an updated camera.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 received mostly positive reviews; the phone was praised for its display, hardware, camera, long battery life, and incorporating water resistance while retaining a removable battery and MicroSD slot.<ref>[https://mobilesyrup.com/2014/11/30/the-samsung-galaxy-s5-is-the-best-boring-android-smartphone/]</ref> However, the S5 was criticized for [[Software bloat|bloated software]], the inconsistent [[fingerprint scanner]] featured on the phone, and its plastic design in light of rival smartphones' more premium metal bodies.<ref name=engadget-review/><ref name=guardian-fphacked/><ref name=verge-review/> Added a ringtone, [[Congratulations (PewDiePie, Roomie and Boyinaband song)|Congratulations]], the only songs as a ringtone, released by [[Sweden|Swedish]] YouTuber [[PewDiePie]], Swedish singer/musician Roomie and [[English]] musician [[Boyinaband]].\n\nIn August 2015, following the release of its then-latest flagship, the [[Galaxy S6]], Samsung released an updated version called the \"Galaxy S5 Neo\" which has an Exynos 7 Octa (7580) processor clocked at 1.6&nbsp; GHz. It has 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal storage and comes with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Lollipop|5.0.2 \"Lollipop\"]].\n\n== Release date ==\nThe Galaxy S5 was unveiled on 24 February 2014 as part of the company's presentation at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung Electronics president JK Shin explained that consumers did not want a phone dependent on [[Bleeding edge technology|\"eye-popping\" or \"complex\" technology]], but one with \"beautiful design and performance\", a \"simple, yet powerful camera\", \"faster and seamless connectivity\", and fitness-oriented features.<ref name=cnet-s5unveil>{{cite web|title=Galaxy S5 unveiled with fingerprint sensor, bigger screen|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-s5-unveiled-with-fingerprint-sensor-bigger-screen/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSamsung announced that it would release the S5 on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries\u2014including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].<ref name=\"releasedate\">{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/samsung-galaxy-s5-launching-on-april-11-in-150-countries/ | title=Samsung Galaxy S5 launching on April 11th in 150 countries | work=Engadget |publisher=AOL | date=24 February 2012 | accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> On 18 June 2014, Samsung unveiled an [[LTE-Advanced]] version of the S5, exclusively released in [[South Korea]].

It features a rounded, [[polycarbonate]] [[chassis]] carrying a \"modern glam\" look, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover. Unlike past models, the S5's rear cover uses a higher quality soft plastic and is dimpled to improve grip. The S5 is [[IP67]] certified for dust and water resistance. As such, the phone is able to be submerged in water up to {{convert|1|m|ft}} for up to 30 minutes. The S5's [[Micro-USB]] [[USB 3.0|3.0]] port uses a removable cover. The S5 is available in Charcoal Black, Electric Blue, Copper Gold, and Shimmery White color finishes. The S5's screen is a {{Convert|5.1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[1080p]] [[Super AMOLED]] panel, which is slightly larger than that of the S4, and allows for automatic brightness and [[gamut]] adjustments.<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/>\n\n==== Front panel ====\nBelow the screen are three buttons. The physical \"Home\" button in the centre contains a swipe-based [[fingerprint scanner]]. The \"Recent apps\" and \"Back\" buttons are capacitive. In accordance with Android 4.0 human interface guidelines, the S5 no longer uses a \"Menu\" key like its predecessors, although its button layout is still reversed in comparison to other Android devices with the S5's button layout (such as the [[HTC One X]] and [[Galaxy Nexus]], whose \"Back\" buttons are to the left of \"Home\").<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/><ref name=\"anandtech-onereview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/6747/htc-one-review | title=The HTC One Review | last=Klug | first=Brian | publisher=AnandTech Inc. | work=AnandTech | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502210403/http://anandtech.com/show/6747/htc-one-review | archivedate=2 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=5 April 2013 | accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe S5 includes a 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing camera, which offers [[4K resolution|4K (2160p)]] video recording at 30[[framerate|fps]], phase detection [[autofocus]] (which Samsung claims to be able to focus in around 0.3&nbsp;seconds),<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/> real-time [[High-dynamic-range imaging|HDR]] photos and video (of which the latter is available for the first time in a Samsung flagship mobile devie), and an [[image sensor]] with Samsung's \"[[Isocell]]\" technology, which isolates the individual pixels inside the sensor to improve its ability to capture light and reduce crosstalk.

Although praised for an improved appearance and build quality, the design of the S5 was panned for retaining a nearly identical appearance and construction to the S4,{{efn|Actually, the design has noticeable changes. The back cover has no more glossy polycarbonate and has a new dot pattern, similar to the Google Nexus 7-2012.}} and for not using higher quality materials such as metal or a higher-quality plastic. The display of the S5 was praised for having a high quality, not being as oversaturated as previous models, and having a wide range of viewing angles, brightness states, and gamut settings to fine tune its appearance. ''[[TechRadar]]'' also noticed that, despite the high power of its processor, some apps and interface functions suffered from performance issues, indicating that the S5's operating system may not have been completely optimized for its system-on-chip.

The movie's narrative spans the years 1961 to 1986. It stars [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Steve Zahn]], [[Brittany Murphy]], and [[James Woods]]. It was the last film directed by [[Penny Marshall]]. Although the film is co-produced by Beverly Donofrio, many of its details differ from the book.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1961, eleven-year-old Beverly \"Bev\" Donofrio rides with her father, [[Connecticut]] police officer Leonard, to the [[Christmas]] tree lot. When she reveals that she wants a [[bra]] for Christmas in order to get the attention of a boy she likes, Leonard tells her she is too young to be thinking about boys, and to focus on books.\n\nIn 1965, Bev is now an intelligent, but na\u00efve fifteen-year-old. Her dream is to go to college in New York City and become a writer. She joins her friends, Fay and Tina, at a party. Fay finds her older boyfriend Bobby, who is about to be [[Vietnam War|deployed to Vietnam]], while Bev gives a love letter to a popular boy named Sky. When Sky reads the letter aloud, Bev flees to the bathroom. She is consoled by Ray, a stranger, who then defends Bev's honor and fights with Sky. Bev and Ray, with Fay and Bobby, flee the party. The four go to a lookout, where Bobby and Fay [[have sex]]. Bev is overcome by Ray's kindness, and they too have sex. Leonard, who is on duty, drives up and brings them to the police station, where Bev claims that they only kissed.\n\nBev discovers that she is [[pregnant]]. She tells Ray, initially turns down his offer to get [[marriage|married]], then placates her shocked parents by agreeing to a hasty [[wedding]]. At the reception, everyone is avoiding Bev, so Fay publicly announce that she is also pregnant. Fay confides to Bev that her father wanted her to put the baby up for [[adoption]], but she and Bobby will be getting married instead. The two girls eventually celebrate the fact they will be mothers together.\n\nOver the next few months, the girls bemoan missing out on three things: their childhood, their high school [[prom]], and an education. Bev gives birth to son Jason, while Fay has daughter Amelia. Bev continues to pursue her education. When Jason is three, she wins the chance for a college scholarship. Unfortunately, Bev's interview goes badly when she is forced to take Jason along. Although the interviewer praises Bev's writings, he states that she has too many distractions. Later, Fay reveals that she and Bobby are getting [[divorced]], because he met someone while stationed in [[Hawaii]]. Bev tells Fay that she's not sure if she loves Jason, because his birth has cost her so much. When Jason almost drowns in Fay's [[swimming pool|pool]], Bev vows to be more attentive.\n\nOn Jason's seventh birthday, several people from Bev's high school show up to his party: old friend Tina is now engaged and going to [[New York University|NYU]]; and Tommy, who had a crush on Bev, just graduated from [[University of California Berkeley|Berkeley]]. He suggests that Bev move her family to [[California]] and pursue her education there, since the state offers financial aid. Ray agrees to the plan, but on the day they are supposed to leave, he confesses that he is a [[addiction|heroin addict]] and spent their savings on drugs. Bev helps him detox, but Ray sneaks out to get more drugs. When he tells Bev that it's impossible for him to quit, she tells him he should leave instead. Ray agrees, but young Jason chases after him in tears, then tells Bev that he hates her for making Ray leave. \n\nTwo years later, Bev still yearns for [[California]]. She and Fay help Lizard (one of Ray's old friends) dry [[marijuana|weed]] in Bev's oven. Jason, still bitter, tells Grandpa Leonard, who arrests the mothers (Lizard had left). Fay's brother bails them out, using up their savings, on the condition that Fay and Amelia move away with him and cut off contact with Bev. Bev harshly tells the smug Jason that he ruined their lives. She claims that it's his fault Amelia moved away.\n\nIn 1985, Bev and Jason are driving to see Ray. She managed to get her college degree and has written her [[memoir]], but needs Ray to sign a waiver or else her book will not be published. While driving, Jason tells Bev that he wants to transfer from NYU to [[Indiana University]], but Bev refuses, saying that he is getting the education that she never could. Jason calls his now-girlfriend Amelia with the bad news. Amelia is dejected but assures him that she is not angry. Arriving at Ray's trailer, Bev explains why they are there. When Ray's wife, Shirley, demands $100,000, Bev screams at Ray and storms out. Jason follows her and calls her selfish for only caring about her book when he finally got to see his father again. He accuses her of being a bad mother and she storms off. \n\nRay comes outside and talks with Jason, stating that leaving was the best thing he could have done for Jason and he believes it's the only reason Jason turned out so well. He sneaks the signed papers to Jason. Jason finds Bev, who insists that she was a great mother who sacrificed everything for him. Jason reveals that he will transfer in order to be with Amelia and apologizes to Bev for ruining her life. Bev softens and tells Jason that she is proud of him and thinks of him as the best thing in her life. She also tells him that she holds herself responsible for her various mistakes and poor choices, and that she never meant to blame him for them. She gives him her car to drive to [[Indiana]].  \n\nBeverly is forced to call Leonard for a ride. She complains to him how Jason blames her for everything wrong in his life. She then realizes that she herself has done the same to her father. Together, they sing a song from her childhood as they drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as [[Beverly Donofrio|Beverly \"Bev\" Donofrio]]\n** [[Mika Boorem]] as Bev Donofrio, age 11\n* [[Marisa Ryan]] as Janet Donofrio\n** Olivia Morgan Scheck as Janet Donofrio, age 12\n** Celine Marget as Janet Donofrio, age 8 \n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Raymond \"Ray\" Hasek\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Fay Forrester\n* [[Adam Garcia]] as Jason Hasek-Donofrio\n** Joseph M.

The movie's narrative spans the years 1961 to 1986. It stars [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Steve Zahn]], [[Brittany Murphy]], and [[James Woods]]. It was the last film directed by [[Penny Marshall]]. Although the film is co-produced by Beverly Donofrio, many of its details differ from the book.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1961, eleven-year-old Beverly \"Bev\" Donofrio rides with her father, [[Connecticut]] police officer Leonard, to the [[Christmas]] tree lot. When she reveals that she wants a [[bra]] for Christmas in order to get the attention of a boy she likes, Leonard tells her she is too young to be thinking about boys, and to focus on books.\n\nIn 1965, Bev is now an intelligent, but na\u00efve fifteen-year-old. Her dream is to go to college in New York City and become a writer. She joins her friends, Fay and Tina, at a party. Fay finds her older boyfriend Bobby, who is about to be [[Vietnam War|deployed to Vietnam]], while Bev gives a love letter to a popular boy named Sky. When Sky reads the letter aloud, Bev flees to the bathroom. She is consoled by Ray, a stranger, who then defends Bev's honor and fights with Sky. Bev and Ray, with Fay and Bobby, flee the party. The four go to a lookout, where Bobby and Fay [[have sex]]. Bev is overcome by Ray's kindness, and they too have sex. Leonard, who is on duty, drives up and brings them to the police station, where Bev claims that they only kissed.\n\nBev discovers that she is [[pregnant]]. She tells Ray, initially turns down his offer to get [[marriage|married]], then placates her shocked parents by agreeing to a hasty [[wedding]]. At the reception, everyone is avoiding Bev, so Fay publicly announce that she is also pregnant. Fay confides to Bev that her father wanted her to put the baby up for [[adoption]], but she and Bobby will be getting married instead. The two girls eventually celebrate the fact they will be mothers together.\n\nOver the next few months, the girls bemoan missing out on three things: their childhood, their high school [[prom]], and an education. Bev gives birth to son Jason, while Fay has daughter Amelia. Bev continues to pursue her education. When Jason is three, she wins the chance for a college scholarship. Unfortunately, Bev's interview goes badly when she is forced to take Jason along. Although the interviewer praises Bev's writings, he states that she has too many distractions. Later, Fay reveals that she and Bobby are getting [[divorced]], because he met someone while stationed in [[Hawaii]]. Bev tells Fay that she's not sure if she loves Jason, because his birth has cost her so much. When Jason almost drowns in Fay's [[swimming pool|pool]], Bev vows to be more attentive.\n\nOn Jason's seventh birthday, several people from Bev's high school show up to his party: old friend Tina is now engaged and going to [[New York University|NYU]]; and Tommy, who had a crush on Bev, just graduated from [[University of California Berkeley|Berkeley]]. He suggests that Bev move her family to [[California]] and pursue her education there, since the state offers financial aid. Ray agrees to the plan, but on the day they are supposed to leave, he confesses that he is a [[addiction|heroin addict]] and spent their savings on drugs. Bev helps him detox, but Ray sneaks out to get more drugs. When he tells Bev that it's impossible for him to quit, she tells him he should leave instead. Ray agrees, but young Jason chases after him in tears, then tells Bev that he hates her for making Ray leave. \n\nTwo years later, Bev still yearns for [[California]]. She and Fay help Lizard (one of Ray's old friends) dry [[marijuana|weed]] in Bev's oven. Jason, still bitter, tells Grandpa Leonard, who arrests the mothers (Lizard had left). Fay's brother bails them out, using up their savings, on the condition that Fay and Amelia move away with him and cut off contact with Bev. Bev harshly tells the smug Jason that he ruined their lives. She claims that it's his fault Amelia moved away.\n\nIn 1985, Bev and Jason are driving to see Ray. She managed to get her college degree and has written her [[memoir]], but needs Ray to sign a waiver or else her book will not be published. While driving, Jason tells Bev that he wants to transfer from NYU to [[Indiana University]], but Bev refuses, saying that he is getting the education that she never could. Jason calls his now-girlfriend Amelia with the bad news. Amelia is dejected but assures him that she is not angry. Arriving at Ray's trailer, Bev explains why they are there. When Ray's wife, Shirley, demands $100,000, Bev screams at Ray and storms out. Jason follows her and calls her selfish for only caring about her book when he finally got to see his father again. He accuses her of being a bad mother and she storms off. \n\nRay comes outside and talks with Jason, stating that leaving was the best thing he could have done for Jason and he believes it's the only reason Jason turned out so well. He sneaks the signed papers to Jason. Jason finds Bev, who insists that she was a great mother who sacrificed everything for him. Jason reveals that he will transfer in order to be with Amelia and apologizes to Bev for ruining her life. Bev softens and tells Jason that she is proud of him and thinks of him as the best thing in her life. She also tells him that she holds herself responsible for her various mistakes and poor choices, and that she never meant to blame him for them. She gives him her car to drive to [[Indiana]].  \n\nBeverly is forced to call Leonard for a ride. She complains to him how Jason blames her for everything wrong in his life. She then realizes that she herself has done the same to her father. Together, they sing a song from her childhood as they drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as [[Beverly Donofrio|Beverly \"Bev\" Donofrio]]\n** [[Mika Boorem]] as Bev Donofrio, age 11\n* [[Marisa Ryan]] as Janet Donofrio\n** Olivia Morgan Scheck as Janet Donofrio, age 12\n** Celine Marget as Janet Donofrio, age 8 \n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Raymond \"Ray\" Hasek\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Fay Forrester\n* [[Adam Garcia]] as Jason Hasek-Donofrio\n** Joseph M.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

County, Washington|Snohomish County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
