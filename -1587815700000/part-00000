It was written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Matt Shakman]].\n\nAt Dragonstone, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] observe cave drawings left by the Children of the Forest, indicating that the First Men and the Children fought together against the [[White Walkers]]. In King's Landing, [[Cersei Lannister]] seeks further investment from the Iron Bank, after reassuring them that their debt will soon be paid. In the North, [[Arya Stark]] returns to Winterfell, reunites with her siblings, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Bran Stark]], and spars with [[Brienne of Tarth]]. On the road to King's Landing, [[Jaime Lannister]], [[Bronn (character)|Bronn]], and the Lannister and Tarly armies are caught in an attack led by Daenerys, her dragon [[List of dragons#Literature|Drogon]], and the Dothraki army.\n\nThe title of the episode refers to the Tyrell gold and other resources in possession of the Lannisters after taking Highgarden. \"The Spoils of War\" received praise from critics with one critic defining it as a \"masterpiece\", who listed the concluding battle sequence between Daenerys and Jaime, Arya's return to Winterfell and interaction with Brienne, and Daenerys and Jon's conversation at Dragonstone as highlights of the episode. It received a nomination at the [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series|Outstanding Editing]], and was also [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]'s pick to support his nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor]], his first ever for this series.\n\nThe episode set an industry record for the most stuntmen set on fire, with 73 \"fire burns\", in addition to 20 people being set on fire for a single shot. In the United States, the episode [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 10.17 million in its initial broadcast, the 3rd highest in the series. \"The Spoils of War\" also received multiple awards and nominations, including \"Best TV Episode\" and \"2017 People's Choice Award\" from [[IGN]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_TV_Episode |title=Best TV Episode |publisher=IGN }}</ref>\n\n\"The Spoils of War\" marked the final appearance of [[Ellie Kendrick]] (Meera Reed).\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--\"Too long\" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->\n\n===In King's Landing===\nCersei assures Tycho that the Crown's debts to the Iron Bank will be fully repaid. They discuss the possibility of a new loan that would enable [[Qyburn]] to engage the mercenary Golden Company of Essos.\n\n===At Winterfell===\nLittlefinger gives Bran the Valyrian steel dagger that was used in [[The Kingsroad#In the North|the attempt on Bran's life]]. Littlefinger tries to get Bran to tell him of his experiences after fleeing Winterfell, and is disconcerted when Bran repeats to him [[The Climb (Game of Thrones)#In King.27s Landing|Littlefinger's earlier remark to Varys]] that \"chaos is a ladder.\" Meera visits Bran to say farewell, as she wants to be with her family when the [[White Walker]]s attack. Bran is indifferent to her departure, and a dismayed Meera remarks figuratively that Bran died in the [[Brynden Rivers|Three-Eyed Raven]]'s cave.\n\nArya arrives at Winterfell and evades the guards to visit [[Ned Stark|Ned]]'s tomb in the crypts, where Sansa finds her. Sansa takes Arya to see Bran in the godswood. Arya is taken aback to find that Bran knows of her kill list, and Bran gives her the Valyrian steel dagger. [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] reassures [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] that she has fulfilled her oath to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]; Brienne insists she did almost nothing. Later, Brienne and Podrick spar and Arya asks to train with Brienne. They fight to a draw as Sansa and Littlefinger watch.\n\n===At Dragonstone===\nJon shows Daenerys the vast [[dragonglass]] mine, in which [[Children of the Forest]] cave drawings depict the Children and the First Men fighting together against the White Walkers. Seemingly convinced that Jon is telling the truth, Daenerys vows to fight for the North, but only if Jon bends the knee. Jon remains resistant.\n\nTyrion and Varys report the [[pyrrhic victory]] at Casterly Rock and the loss of Highgarden; Daenerys questions Tyrion's loyalties. Considering striking King's Landing with her dragons, she asks Jon for advice. He notes that her followers believe she can change the world, but if she destroys a city, she will be just another tyrant.\n\nLater, the Ironborn survivors return to Dragonstone. Jon confronts Theon, declaring that his role in saving Sansa from Ramsay is the only reason he will not kill him for betraying [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. Theon reveals that he has come for Daenerys' help in rescuing Yara, but Jon and Davos inform him that Daenerys has gone.\n\n===On the Roseroad===\nThe bulk of the Lannister caravan approaches King's Landing after the Tyrell gold has been brought inside the city. Jaime gives Bronn a large satchel of gold, but Bronn still wants the castle he was promised. Riding Drogon, Daenerys leads a Dothraki attack that quickly overruns the caravan. Abandoning the gold where he drops it, Bronn wounds Drogon with Qyburn's [[Scorpio (weapon)|scorpion weapon]]. Drogon destroys the scorpion, then lands. Tyrion watches the chaos with remorse from a safe distance; as Daenerys dismounts to tend Drogon's wound, Tyrion is shocked to see Jaime charge at her. Drogon breathes fire at Jaime, but Bronn tackles him off his horse, out of the flame's path, and into the Blackwater Rush, where Jaime begins to sink under the weight of his armour.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:D.

The sequence continues with Drogon attacking the Lannister and Tarly armies, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer noting that the number of shots of Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen riding Drogon increased significantly, with the entirety of the sixth season having eleven shots, while \"The Spoils of War\" alone had over 80 shots. As the stunt performers were lit on fire, they were required to hold their breath until the fire was put out, and specific attention was given to stunt performers in the middle of the shot, as they faced the brunt of the heat from the fire.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> Shakman also spoke about the difficulty in shooting the dragon sequence and the safety of the performers, saying \"The most difficult was safety because you're dealing with fire, horses and actors&nbsp;\u2014 and those things don't do well in close proximity yet the nature of it was to create this Bosch-like nightmare where, as the scene progresses, it becomes increasingly like you're in the pit of hell. That was difficult.\"<ref name=\"direct\"/>\n\n[[Robert McLachlan (cinematographer)|Robert McLachlan]] who served as [[cinematographer]] for the episode, and previously was cinematographer for episodes including \"[[The Rains of Castamere]]\" and \"[[The Dance of Dragons]]\" in the show's [[Game of Thrones (season 3)|third]] and [[Game of Thrones (season 5)|fifth seasons]] respectively, was also interviewed about the process of creating the \"Loot Train Attack.\" In an interview conducted by ''[[The Verge]]'', McLachlan revealed that the production team received the script for the episode more than a year in advance. Several cameras were used to capture the \"Loot Train Attack,\" including a small handheld camera known as an [[Osmo (camera)|Osmo]], which \"allowed a horseman to get shots while riding a horse at a full gallop through the cavalry charge,\" as well as a \"custom-built miniature helicopter drone\" for the \"overhead dragon shots.\" A cable-cam was also used, which made several passes over the battlefield during the course of filming. Going into filming, one of McLachlan's most desired effects was the amount of smoke on the battlefield, saying \"we wanted to block the sun out so the shots would have some consistency. And I knew the fire and smoke would be incredibly beautiful.\" White smoke was used towards the beginning of filming, but as the battle went on, McLachlan decided to switch to black smoke, which was accomplished through burning diesel oil. This caused the crew to be required to wear masks and goggles, and raised concern for HBO's safety officer, who eventually prohibited further use of the black smoke due to health and safety concerns. Additional smoke was added later by the special effects team.<ref name=\"mclachlan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/11/16135410/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-4-spoils-of-war-cinematographer-robert-mclachlan |title=Game of Thrones\u2019 cinematographer breaks down the \u2018dragon-induced Armageddon\u2019 in The Spoils of War |website=The Verge |accessdate=August 11, 2017 |date=August 11, 2017 |author=Robinson, Tasha}}</ref>\n\nThe number of extras that were utilized for filming the \"Loot Train Attack\" began with more than 600 extras, and gradually decreased as the weeks of filming went on, with 400 extras returning the following week, and ultimately concluded with approximately 100 extras, according to McLachlan. McLachlan also discussed the \"oner\" featuring Bronn, which he described as a single shot that \"runs for as long as possible,\" revealing that the sequence was actually three shots that were stitched together by the special effects team, led by VFX supervisor Joe Bauer. He continued by revealing that the entire \"oner\" Bronn sequence was accomplished in only three takes.<ref name=\"mclachlan\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'', [[Sophie Turner]], who portrays Sansa Stark, spoke about filming the reunion scene with [[Maisie Williams]], who portrays Arya Stark. Turner stated that the two kept laughing during the filming of the scene, and that they couldn't \"keep a straight face\". She continued, \"Our relationship is so close, but it's only that fun side, never the business side. I was nervous. It just terrified me. It's like performing for your mum. When somebody is watching you don't do it quite as well.\" Williams also spoke about the scene, saying, \"It was the weirdest thing when we shot our first scene together. We were both embarrassed to do our thing in front of each other. It took a few hours for us to get serious and actually do it. Later it was fine on set and we could concentrate, but it was so hard to get into character with Sophie in front of me.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/08/06/game-of-thrones-sansa-arya-reunion-interview/ |title=Game of Thrones stars on that emotional 'Spoils of War' reunion |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=August 6, 2017 |date=August 6, 2017 |author=Hibberd, James}}</ref> Shakman also spoke about the reunion in a separate interview, saying, \"It was fun for them, it was fun for us to see them work together, and same with Isaac when they all got together.

It was written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Matt Shakman]].\n\nAt Dragonstone, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] observe cave drawings left by the Children of the Forest, indicating that the First Men and the Children fought together against the [[White Walkers]]. In King's Landing, [[Cersei Lannister]] seeks further investment from the Iron Bank, after reassuring them that their debt will soon be paid. In the North, [[Arya Stark]] returns to Winterfell, reunites with her siblings, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Bran Stark]], and spars with [[Brienne of Tarth]]. On the road to King's Landing, [[Jaime Lannister]], [[Bronn (character)|Bronn]], and the Lannister and Tarly armies are caught in an attack led by Daenerys, her dragon [[List of dragons#Literature|Drogon]], and the Dothraki army.\n\nThe title of the episode refers to the Tyrell gold and other resources in possession of the Lannisters after taking Highgarden. \"The Spoils of War\" received praise from critics with one critic defining it as a \"masterpiece\", who listed the concluding battle sequence between Daenerys and Jaime, Arya's return to Winterfell and interaction with Brienne, and Daenerys and Jon's conversation at Dragonstone as highlights of the episode. It received a nomination at the [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series|Outstanding Editing]], and was also [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]'s pick to support his nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor]], his first ever for this series.\n\nThe episode set an industry record for the most stuntmen set on fire, with 73 \"fire burns\", in addition to 20 people being set on fire for a single shot. In the United States, the episode [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 10.17 million in its initial broadcast, the 3rd highest in the series. \"The Spoils of War\" also received multiple awards and nominations, including \"Best TV Episode\" and \"2017 People's Choice Award\" from [[IGN]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_TV_Episode |title=Best TV Episode |publisher=IGN }}</ref>\n\n\"The Spoils of War\" marked the final appearance of [[Ellie Kendrick]] (Meera Reed).\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--\"Too long\" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->\n===In King's Landing===\nCersei assures Tycho that the Crown's debts to the Iron Bank will be fully repaid. They discuss the possibility of a new loan that would enable [[Qyburn]] to engage the mercenary Golden Company of Essos.\n\n===At Winterfell===\nLittlefinger gives Bran the Valyrian steel dagger that was used in [[The Kingsroad#In the North|the attempt on Bran's life]]. Littlefinger tries to get Bran to tell him of his experiences after fleeing Winterfell, and is disconcerted when Bran repeats to him [[The Climb (Game of Thrones)#In King.27s Landing|Littlefinger's earlier remark to Varys]] that \"chaos is a ladder.\" Meera visits Bran to say farewell, as she wants to be with her family when the [[White Walker]]s attack. Bran is indifferent to her departure, and a dismayed Meera remarks figuratively that Bran died in the [[Brynden Rivers|Three-Eyed Raven]]'s cave.\n\nArya arrives at Winterfell and evades the guards to visit [[Ned Stark|Ned]]'s tomb in the crypts, where Sansa finds her. Sansa takes Arya to see Bran in the godswood. Arya is taken aback to find that Bran knows of her kill list, and Bran gives her the Valyrian steel dagger. [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] reassures [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] that she has fulfilled her oath to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]; Brienne insists she did almost nothing. Later, Brienne and Podrick spar and Arya asks to train with Brienne. They fight to a draw as Sansa and Littlefinger watch.\n\n===At Dragonstone===\nJon shows Daenerys the vast [[dragonglass]] mine, in which [[Children of the Forest]] cave drawings depict the Children and the First Men fighting together against the White Walkers. Seemingly convinced that Jon is telling the truth, Daenerys vows to fight for the North, but only if Jon bends the knee. Jon remains resistant.\n\nTyrion and Varys report the [[pyrrhic victory]] at Casterly Rock and the loss of Highgarden; Daenerys questions Tyrion's loyalties. Considering striking King's Landing with her dragons, she asks Jon for advice. He notes that her followers believe she can change the world, but if she destroys a city, she will be just another tyrant.\n\nLater, the Ironborn survivors return to Dragonstone. Jon confronts Theon, declaring that his role in saving Sansa from Ramsay is the only reason he will not kill him for betraying [[Robb Stark|Robb]]. Theon reveals that he has come for Daenerys' help in rescuing Yara, but Jon and Davos inform him that Daenerys has gone.\n\n===On the Roseroad===\nThe bulk of the Lannister caravan approaches King's Landing after the Tyrell gold has been brought inside the city. Jaime gives Bronn a large satchel of gold, but Bronn still wants the castle he was promised. Riding Drogon, Daenerys leads a Dothraki attack that quickly overruns the caravan. Abandoning the gold where he drops it, Bronn wounds Drogon with Qyburn's [[Scorpio (weapon)|scorpion weapon]]. Drogon destroys the scorpion, then lands. Tyrion watches the chaos with remorse from a safe distance; as Daenerys dismounts to tend Drogon's wound, Tyrion is shocked to see Jaime charge at her. Drogon breathes fire at Jaime, but Bronn tackles him off his horse, out of the flame's path, and into the Blackwater Rush, where Jaime begins to sink under the weight of his armour.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:D.

He's the human intermediary there to see the battle through.\" Shakman filmed [[Peter Dinklage]] as Tyrion about a mile from the battlefield, and most of his shots involved \"staring at lots of different tennis balls\" for eye line.<ref name=\"ignshak\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/game-of-thrones-spoils-of-war-director-on-jon-and-daenerys-romance-and-that-ending |title=Game of Thrones \"Spoils of War\" Director on Jon and Daenerys Romance and That Ending |accessdate=August 7, 2017 |date=August 7, 2017 |author=Schwartz, Terri |website=IGN}}</ref> Shakman drew inspiration for the direction of the sequence from [[Miguel Sapochnik]], who directed the [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|sixth season]] episode \"[[Battle of the Bastards]]\", and [[Neil Marshall]], who directed the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]\", as well as the battles in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' and ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]''.<ref name=\"direct\"/> Shakman also revealed that he used the volcanic destruction of [[Pompeii]] as a reference, which led to the idea of some of the army being turned to ash.<ref name=\"varietyshak\"/>\n\nFor the beginning of the \"Loot Train Attack,\" with the Dothraki approaching, Shakman stated that he wanted it to feel like a [[Western (genre)|Western]], saying in the interview, \"I wanted that feeling of a Western&nbsp;\u2014 this savage attack coming at this more formalized line of men, that tension of circling the wagons and trying to protect them from the chaos and the onslaught.\"<ref name=\"direct\"/> Shakman worked with the horse mistress, Camilla Naprous,<ref name=\"latimes\"/> in order to show the Dothraki's mastery at horse riding, which included standing on the horse's saddles while shooting arrows.<ref name=\"direct\"/> In order to accomplish this stunt, Naprous built what was referred to as a \"metal shoe\" that allowed the stunt performers to stand on the horses. The sequence continues with Drogon attacking the Lannister and Tarly armies, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer noting that the number of shots of Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen riding Drogon increased significantly, with the entirety of the sixth season having eleven shots, while \"The Spoils of War\" alone had over 80 shots. As the stunt performers were lit on fire, they were required to hold their breath until the fire was put out, and specific attention was given to stunt performers in the middle of the shot, as they faced the brunt of the heat from the fire.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> Shakman also spoke about the difficulty in shooting the dragon sequence and the safety of the performers, saying \"The most difficult was safety because you're dealing with fire, horses and actors&nbsp;\u2014 and those things don't do well in close proximity yet the nature of it was to create this Bosch-like nightmare where, as the scene progresses, it becomes increasingly like you're in the pit of hell. That was difficult.\"<ref name=\"direct\"/>\n\n[[Robert McLachlan (cinematographer)|Robert McLachlan]] who served as [[cinematographer]] for the episode, and previously was cinematographer for episodes including \"[[The Rains of Castamere]]\" and \"[[The Dance of Dragons]]\" in the show's [[Game of Thrones (season 3)|third]] and [[Game of Thrones (season 5)|fifth seasons]] respectively, was also interviewed about the process of creating the \"Loot Train Attack.\" In an interview conducted by ''[[The Verge]]'', McLachlan revealed that the production team received the script for the episode more than a year in advance. Several cameras were used to capture the \"Loot Train Attack,\" including a small handheld camera known as an [[Osmo (camera)|Osmo]], which \"allowed a horseman to get shots while riding a horse at a full gallop through the cavalry charge,\" as well as a \"custom-built miniature helicopter drone\" for the \"overhead dragon shots.\" A cable-cam was also used, which made several passes over the battlefield during the course of filming. Going into filming, one of McLachlan's most desired effects was the amount of smoke on the battlefield, saying \"we wanted to block the sun out so the shots would have some consistency. And I knew the fire and smoke would be incredibly beautiful.\" White smoke was used towards the beginning of filming, but as the battle went on, McLachlan decided to switch to black smoke, which was accomplished through burning diesel oil. This caused the crew to be required to wear masks and goggles, and raised concern for HBO's safety officer, who eventually prohibited further use of the black smoke due to health and safety concerns. Additional smoke was added later by the special effects team.<ref name=\"mclachlan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/11/16135410/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-4-spoils-of-war-cinematographer-robert-mclachlan |title=Game of Thrones\u2019 cinematographer breaks down the \u2018dragon-induced Armageddon\u2019 in The Spoils of War |website=The Verge |accessdate=August 11, 2017 |date=August 11, 2017 |author=Robinson, Tasha}}</ref>\n\nThe number of extras that were utilized for filming the \"Loot Train Attack\" began with more than 600 extras, and gradually decreased as the weeks of filming went on, with 400 extras returning the following week, and ultimately concluded with approximately 100 extras, according to McLachlan. McLachlan also discussed the \"oner\" featuring Bronn, which he described as a single shot that \"runs for as long as possible,\" revealing that the sequence was actually three shots that were stitched together by the special effects team, led by VFX supervisor Joe Bauer. He continued by revealing that the entire \"oner\" Bronn sequence was accomplished in only three takes.<ref name=\"mclachlan\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'', [[Sophie Turner]], who portrays Sansa Stark, spoke about filming the reunion scene with [[Maisie Williams]], who portrays Arya Stark. Turner stated that the two kept laughing during the filming of the scene, and that they couldn't \"keep a straight face\". She continued, \"Our relationship is so close, but it's only that fun side, never the business side. I was nervous. It just terrified me. It's like performing for your mum. When somebody is watching you don't do it quite as well.\" Williams also spoke about the scene, saying, \"It was the weirdest thing when we shot our first scene together.

It may even rival \"[[Hardhome]]\" in terms of spectacle.\" He continued, \"''Game of Thrones'' pulled no punches and showed no quarter this week as we witnessed one of the fiercest and most engaging battles the show's ever produced, featuring major fan-favorite characters on opposite sides of the fight. On top of that, Arya, after seven years, made her way home to Winterfell and managed to best Brienne of Tarth in a friendly training session.

When they emerged from Leonard's bedroom, the others saw them and Penny said \"It's not what it looks like\".\n\nThe first scene takes place at lunch, with Sheldon wondering what Penny meant by her \"[[brain teaser]]\". After he comes up with the idea that Penny was checking Raj's anal region for [[pinworms]], Leonard tells him that Penny and Raj did have sex, and that Penny was lying when she said it wasn't what it looked like. Raj and Howard then arrive. Howard and Leonard are both annoyed that Raj had sex with Penny, and Raj tries to defend himself by saying that they are in love. Leonard reveals to Howard that Raj used to like Bernadette, infuriating Howard further.\n\nSheldon, sensing that Leonard is upset, calls Leonard's mother and the two converse through video chat. Leonard explains that while he doesn't want to get back with Penny, he cannot deal that she slept with one of his friends. He is also confused because his current girlfriend, Priya, is going to move back to [[India]]. His mother, despite her being an expert in psychology, parenting and child development, has no advice other than \"Buck up, sissy pants\".\n\nAmy arrives at Penny's apartment, and Amy tries to console her. She tells an [[apocryphal]] [[Legends of Catherine the Great|legend about Catherine the Great]], a Russian leader in the 18th century who, according to the story, used a system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse. When Penny asks her how this is relevant to her, Amy says that she took part in \"interspecies hanky-panky\" yet people still refer to her as \"the Great\". Then Penny, wanting to avoid contact with Leonard and the others, asks to stay at Amy's house for a while. Raj finds out that Penny is staying there through Amy's [[Facebook]] page and shows up. Raj asks Penny out on a date, but Penny tells him that having sex with him was a mistake and that she wishes to just remain friends. Raj reveals that the previous night, he had trouble putting the condom on and ejaculated prematurely; the two did not actually have sex. She agrees not to tell anyone about this.\n\nDuring a [[paintball]] match against members of other [[Caltech]] departments, Sheldon appoints himself as captain of the guys' team. There is the lack of enthusiasm among the team due to the recent events. Sheldon, blaming himself, sacrifices himself to the geology department and the gang rush out to avenge him, and manage to claim a victory.\n\nAs the guys celebrate their victory, they are interrupted by Penny, who announces her plans to move back to [[Nebraska]], because of her failing acting career and her fractured relationship with the guys. As Leonard tries to comfort her, she is interrupted by a phone call from an agent who tells her she got a part in a [[hemorrhoid]] cream commercial. She changes her mind and stays in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] because she is going to \"be a star\".\n\nThe episode is concluded with everybody watching Penny's hemorrhoid commercial.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nOn the night of its first broadcast on September 22, 2011, the episode was watched by 14.30 million U.S. households and a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.9/15.<ref name=\"s05e01/02\">{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707/|title=Thursday Finals: 'Big Bang Theory,' 'The X Factor,' 'Parks & Recreation' and 'Whitney' Adjusted Up|work=TVbytheNumbers.com|first=Robert|last=Seidman|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> The episode was watched by 3.72 million Canadian viewers and had a weekly ranking of 3.<ref name=\"bbmsept19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2011/nat09192011.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) September 19 \u2013 September 25, 2011 |work=bbm.ca |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609223548/http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2011/nat09192011.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, the episode first aired on October 10, 2011.

When they emerged from Leonard's bedroom, the others saw them and Penny said \"It's not what it looks like\".\n\nThe first scene takes place at lunch, with Sheldon wondering what Penny meant by her \"[[brain teaser]]\". After he comes up with the idea that Penny was checking Raj's anal region for [[pinworms]], Leonard tells him that Penny and Raj did have sex, and that Penny was lying when she said it wasn't what it looked like. Raj and Howard then arrive. Howard and Leonard are both annoyed that Raj had sex with Penny, and Raj tries to defend himself by saying that they are in love. Leonard reveals to Howard that Raj used to like Bernadette, infuriating Howard further.\n\nSheldon, sensing that Leonard is upset, calls Leonard's mother and the two converse through video chat. Leonard explains that while he doesn't want to get back with Penny, he cannot deal that she slept with one of his friends. He is also confused because his current girlfriend, Priya, is going to move back to [[India]]. His mother, despite her being an expert in psychology, parenting and child development, has no advice other than \"Buck up, sissy pants\".\n\nAmy arrives at Penny's apartment, and Amy tries to console her. She tells an [[apocryphal]] [[Legends of Catherine the Great|legend about Catherine the Great]], a Russian leader in the 18th century who, according to the story, used a system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse. When Penny asks her how this is relevant to her, Amy says that she took part in \"interspecies hanky-panky\" yet people still refer to her as \"the Great\". Then Penny, wanting to avoid contact with Leonard and the others, asks to stay at Amy's house for a while. Raj finds out that Penny is staying there through Amy's [[Facebook]] page and shows up. Raj asks Penny out on a date, but Penny tells him that having sex with him was a mistake and that she wishes to just remain friends. Raj reveals that the previous night, he had trouble putting the condom on and ejaculated prematurely; the two did not actually have sex. She agrees not to tell anyone about this.\n\nDuring a [[paintball]] match against members of other [[Caltech]] departments, Sheldon appoints himself as captain of the guys' team. There is the lack of enthusiasm among the team due to the recent events. Sheldon, blaming himself, sacrifices himself to the geology department and the gang rush out to avenge him, and manage to claim a victory.\n\nAs the guys celebrate their victory, they are interrupted by Penny, who announces her plans to move back to [[Nebraska]], because of her failing acting career and her fractured relationship with the guys. As Leonard tries to comfort her, she is interrupted by a phone call from an agent who tells her she got a part in a [[hemorrhoid]] cream commercial. She changes her mind and stays in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] because she is going to \"be a star\".\n\nThe episode is concluded with everybody watching Penny's hemorrhoid commercial.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nOn the night of its first broadcast on September 22, 2011, the episode was watched by 14.30 million U.S. households and a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.9/15.<ref name=\"s05e01/02\">{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707/|title=Thursday Finals: 'Big Bang Theory,' 'The X Factor,' 'Parks & Recreation' and 'Whitney' Adjusted Up|work=TVbytheNumbers.com|first=Robert|last=Seidman|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> The episode was watched by 3.72 million Canadian viewers and had a weekly ranking of 3.<ref name=\"bbmsept19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2011/nat09192011.pdf |title=Top Programs \u2013 Total Canada (English) September 19 \u2013 September 25, 2011 |work=bbm.ca |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609223548/http://www.bbm.ca/_documents/top_30_tv_programs_english/2011/nat09192011.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn Australia, the episode first aired on October 10, 2011.

[[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and a committee chaired by Lady Smallwood are attending.

[[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson|John]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) befriends a woman he met on a bus.  It is hinted to be an affair, but John texts the woman to say that it's over.\n\nMycroft and [[Scotland Yard]] detectives including [[List of Sherlock characters#Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade|Greg Lestrade]] ([[Rupert Graves]]) bring Sherlock various cases, hoping it will reveal Moriarty's scheme.  One case involves the son of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] cabinet minister Charlie Welsborough.  The son is found dead in a car crash, despite having been on a [[gap year]] in [[Tibet]].  Sherlock quickly solves the case, and reveals that the son was hiding in the car, planning to surprise his father, but died from a seizure.  Sherlock notes a missing bust of [[Margaret Thatcher]] at the victim's home, finding that it was stolen and smashed upon the front porch.  Lestrade reveals to Sherlock that four other busts made in the series are smashed.  Hunting the last, Sherlock encounters a culprit.  They fight, but the culprit escapes.  In the center of the last bust is a memory stick.\n\nQuestioned by Sherlock, Mary relates her past as a freelance agent on a team called 'A.G.R.A.'.  Each had a memory stick containing their confidential material, lest anyone be betrayed by another.  Six years prior, a rescue mission of hostages at the British embassy in [[Tbilisi]] went wrong, when a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' (set off by a code word \"Ammo\") killed everyone except Ajay ([[Sacha Dhawan]]) and Mary.\nSherlock tries to stop Mary from going after Ajay, but Mary drugs him and escapes.\n\nMary travels across the world following a random path, but, having planted a tracking device in the memory stick, Sherlock and John follows her to [[Morocco]].  Ajay arrives and attempts to kill all three.  Ajay reveals that while being tortured in Tbilisi, he heard words \"Ammo\" and \"the English woman\", which Ajay assumed to be Mary.  He escaped and hid the memory stick in a half-made bust, then  sought revenge on Mary, believing that she had betrayed them.  They fight, but Ajay is shot by local police.\n\nSherlock deduces that 'Ammo' should be ''Amo'', the Latin word for \"I love\", suggesting Lady Smallwood, whose codename is Love.  Questioned by Mycroft, Smallwood claims to be innocent.  Sherlock meets Smallwood's secretary Vivian Norbury in the [[London Aquarium]].  Vivian confesses that she tipped the terrorists off in Georgia, using the code \"Amo\", thus eliminating the hostages and the 'A.G.R.A.' team.  Her motive was killing the British ambassador, who had found out that Vivian had sold national secrets.  John, Mycroft and the police arrive, and Vivian shoots Sherlock, but Mary jumps in the way, taking the bullet.  Mary professes her love and gratitude for John and Sherlock, and dies.  John, grief-stricken, blames Sherlock, who has vowed to protect Mary.\n\nIn his home, Mycroft finds a sticky note reading \"13th\", and goes to \"Sherrinford\".  Sherlock visits John's [[Therapy|therapist]] but is unable to discuss his issue.  [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] gives Sherlock a DVD, which is a posthumous message from Mary.  In the video, Mary asks Sherlock to 'Save John Watson'.

[[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and a committee chaired by Lady Smallwood are attending.  Sherlock is freed, and resolves to wait for [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Moriarty]]'s ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]) [[The Reichenbach Fall|posthumous]] revenge.\n\n[[List of Sherlock characters#Mary Morstan|Mary Watson]] ([[Amanda Abbington]]) gives birth to a daughter, who is named Rosamund Mary.  [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson|John]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) befriends a woman he met on a bus.  It is hinted to be an affair, but John texts the woman to say that it's over.\n\nMycroft and [[Scotland Yard]] detectives including [[List of Sherlock characters#Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade|Greg Lestrade]] ([[Rupert Graves]]) bring Sherlock various cases, hoping it will reveal Moriarty's scheme.  One case involves the son of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] cabinet minister Charlie Welsborough.  The son is found dead in a car crash, despite having been on a [[gap year]] in [[Tibet]].  Sherlock quickly solves the case, and reveals that the son was hiding in the car, planning to surprise his father, but died from a seizure.  Sherlock notes a missing bust of [[Margaret Thatcher]] at the victim's home, finding that it was stolen and smashed upon the front porch.  Lestrade reveals to Sherlock that four other busts made in the series are smashed.  Hunting the last, Sherlock encounters a culprit.  They fight, but the culprit escapes.  In the center of the last bust is a memory stick.\n\nQuestioned by Sherlock, Mary relates her past as a freelance agent on a team called 'A.G.R.A.'.  Each had a memory stick containing their confidential material, lest anyone be betrayed by another.  Six years prior, a rescue mission of hostages at the British embassy in [[Tbilisi]] went wrong, when a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' (set off by a code word \"Ammo\") killed everyone except Ajay ([[Sacha Dhawan]]) and Mary.\nSherlock tries to stop Mary from going after Ajay, but Mary drugs him and escapes.\n\nMary travels across the world following a random path, but, having planted a tracking device in the memory stick, Sherlock and John follows her to [[Morocco]].  Ajay arrives and attempts to kill all three.  Ajay reveals that while being tortured in Tbilisi, he heard words \"Ammo\" and \"the English woman\", which Ajay assumed to be Mary.  He escaped and hid the memory stick in a half-made bust, then  sought revenge on Mary, believing that she had betrayed them.  They fight, but Ajay is shot by local police.\n\nSherlock deduces that 'Ammo' should be ''Amo'', the Latin word for \"I love\", suggesting Lady Smallwood, whose codename is Love.  Questioned by Mycroft, Smallwood claims to be innocent.  Sherlock meets Smallwood's secretary Vivian Norbury in the [[London Aquarium]].  Vivian confesses that she tipped the terrorists off in Georgia, using the code \"Amo\", thus eliminating the hostages and the 'A.G.R.A.' team.  Her motive was killing the British ambassador, who had found out that Vivian had sold national secrets.  John, Mycroft and the police arrive, and Vivian shoots Sherlock, but Mary jumps in the way, taking the bullet.  Mary professes her love and gratitude for John and Sherlock, and dies.  John, grief-stricken, blames Sherlock, who has vowed to protect Mary.\n\nIn his home, Mycroft finds a sticky note reading \"13th\", and goes to \"Sherrinford\".  Sherlock visits John's [[Therapy|therapist]] but is unable to discuss his issue.  [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] gives Sherlock a DVD, which is a posthumous message from Mary.  In the video, Mary asks Sherlock to 'Save John Watson'.  Sherlock attempts to visit John, but Molly informs Sherlock that John wishes for anyone's help but Sherlock's.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Locations===\nSeries 4 was primarily filmed at [[Pinewood Studio Wales]].\n\nSeveral location scenes for this episode were filmed in [[London]]: scenes involving the bloodhound were filmed at [[Borough Market]] and [[Trinity Church Square]] in Southwark;<ref name=\"borough\">{{cite journal |title=The dog in Sherlock series 4 was an absolute nightmare to work with |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-01-01/the-dog-in-sherlock-series-4-was-an-absolute-nightmare-to-work-with |accessdate=4 January 2017 |journal=[[Radio Times]] |date=1 January 2017}}</ref> Cumberbatch was also filmed on [[Vauxhall Bridge]] running towards the [[SIS Building]].<ref name=\"vauxhall\">{{cite news |title=Benedict Cumberbatch spotted filming Sherlock series four on Vauxhall Bridge |first=Hannah |last=Al-Othman |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/celebritynews/benedict-cumberbatch-spotted-filming-sherlock-series-four-on-vauxhall-bridge-a3235541.html |accessdate=4 January 2017 |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |date=28 April 2016}}</ref> Also filming occurred in the [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] square in [[Marrakesh]], Morocco.<ref name=\"morocco\">{{cite news |title=\n'Sherlock' season 4 spoilers: Morocco plays a part in the plot |first=Edward |last=Hardesty |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/sherlock.season.4.spoilers.part.of.story.to.take.place.in.morocco/87704.htm |accessdate=7 January 2017 |newspaper=[[Christian Today]] |date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References to Arthur Conan Doyle==\nJoanna Robinson of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', notes that Holmes' request to be reminded of Norbury as an example of his over-confidence is a reference to \"[[The Adventure of the Yellow Face]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/sherlock-season-4-episode-1-six-thatchers-recap-easter-eggs-references |title=Sherlock: 11 Easter Eggs, Callbacks, and References You Might Have Missed in \"The Six Thatchers\" |publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |author=Joanna Robinson |date=January 2, 2017 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\"The Six Thatchers\" is based loosely on \"[[The Adventure of the Six Napoleons]]\".
