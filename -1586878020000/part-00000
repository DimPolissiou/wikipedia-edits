The field of token coins is part of [[exonumia]] and token coins are [[token money]]. Tokens have a denomination either shown or implied by size, color or shape. \"Tokens\" are often made of cheaper metals: [[copper]], [[pewter]], [[aluminium]], [[brass]] and [[tin]] were commonly used, while [[bakelite]], [[leather]], [[porcelain]], and other less durable materials are also known.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nA key point of difference between a token coin and a [[legal tender]] coin is that the latter is issued by a governmental authority and is [[medium of exchange|freely exchangeable for goods]]. However, a token coin typically has a much more limited use and is often issued by a private company, group, association or individual. In the case of \"currency tokens\" issued by a company but also recognized by the state there is a convergence between tokens and [[currency]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Currency tokens==\nCurrency tokens issued by a company sometimes ceased to be merely \"trade\" tokens when they were sanctioned by a local government authority: perhaps due to a severe shortage of [[money]] or the government's inability to issue its own coinage. In effect, the organization behind the tokens became the regional bank.\n\n[[File:Strachanco.jpg|thumb|A set of Strachan and Co tokens]]\nA classic example of this is the Strachan and Co trade tokens of [[East Griqualand]] in South Africa, which were used as currency by the indigenous people in the region from 1874. Their initial success resulted from the scarcity of small change in that remote region at that time.\n\nSimilarly, in times of high inflation, tokens have sometimes taken on a currency role. Examples of this are Italian and Israeli telephone tokens, which were always good for the same service (i.e. one phone call) even as prices increased. [[New York City Subway]] tokens were also sometimes accepted in trade, or even in parking meters, since they had a set value.\n\n==Trade tokens or barter tokens==\n[[File:Brothel Token, Red Dog.jpg|thumb|right|A brothel token from the Red Dog Saloon.]]\nCoin-like objects from the [[Roman Empire]] called ''[[spintria]]e'' have been interpreted as an early form of token. Their functions are not documented, but they appear to have been brothel tokens or possibly gaming tokens.<ref>Thomas A. McGinn, ''The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World'' (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 86.</ref>\n\nMedieval English monasteries issued tokens to pay for services from outsiders. These tokens circulated in nearby villages, where they were called \"Abbot's money\".  Also, counters called [[jeton]]s were used as small change without official blessing.<ref>British Tokens And Their Values, Peter Seaby et al, page 7 of the second edition.</ref>\n\nFrom the 17th to the early 19th century in the [[British Isles]] and [[North America]], tokens were commonly issued by merchants in times of acute shortage of coins of the state. These tokens were in effect a pledge redeemable in goods, but not necessarily for currency. These tokens never received official sanction from government but were accepted and circulated quite widely.\n\nIn England, the production of copper [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s was permitted by royal licence in the first few decades of the 17th century, but production ceased during the [[English Civil War]] and a great shortage of small change resulted. This shortage was felt more keenly because of the rapid growth of trade in the towns and cities, and this in turn prompted both local authorities and merchants to issue tokens.\n\nThese tokens were most commonly made of copper or [[brass]], but [[pewter]], [[lead]] and occasionally [[leather]] tokens are also found. Most were not given a specific denomination and were intended to substitute for [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s, but there are also a large number of [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] and sometimes [[penny]] tokens. Halfpenny and penny tokens usually, but not always, bear the denomination on their face.\n[[File:Mc cormick.JPG|thumb|Brass trade token from [[Fort Laramie]], Dakota Territory]]\n\nMost such tokens show the issuer's full name or initials. Where initials were shown, it was common practice to show three initials: the first names of husband and wife and their surname. Tokens would also normally indicate the merchant establishment, either by name or by picture. Most were round, but they are also found in square, heart or octagonal shapes.\n\nThousands of towns and merchants issued these tokens from 1648 until 1672, when official production of [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]]s resumed, and private production was suppressed.\n\nThere were again coin shortages in the late 18th century, when the British [[Royal Mint]] almost ceased production. Merchants once again produced tokens, but they were now machine made and typically larger than their 17th century predecessors, with values of a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] or more. While many were used in trade, they were also produced for advertising and political purposes, and some series were produced for the primary purpose of sale to collectors. These tokens are usually known as [[Conder token]]s, after the writer of the first reference book on them.\n[[File:Show world token new york city.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Show World Center token, New York City, c. 1990]]\n\nThese were issued by merchants in payment for goods with the agreement that they would be redeemed in goods to an equivalent value at the merchants' own outlets. The transaction is therefore one of barter, with the tokens playing a role of convenience, allowing the seller to receive his goods at a rate and time convenient to himself, and the merchant to tie the holder of the token coin to his shop. Trade tokens often gradually changed into barter tokens, as evidenced by the continued circulation of former trade tokens when the need for their use had passed.\n[[File:RATHTOKEN1.jpg|thumb|Aluminum trade token from [[Osage, Kansas]].]]\n\nIn the United States of America, [[Hard times token]]s issued from 1832 to 1844 and [[Civil War token]]s issued in the 1860s made up for shortages of official money.<ref>A Guide Book of United States Coins, R. S. Yeoman and Kenneth Bresset, pages 372 and 376 of the 61st edition</ref>\n\nBecause of weight, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] does not ship coins to the Armed Forces serving overseas, so [[Army and Air Force Exchange Service]] officials chose to make [[Pogs#Military uses|pogs]] in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s. The pogs are about 38 mm (1.5816\" to be exact) in diameter, and feature various military-themed graphics.\n\nThe collecting of trade tokens is part of the field of [[exonumia]], and includes other types of tokens, including transit tokens, encased cents, and many others. In a narrow sense, trade tokens are \"good for\" tokens, issued by merchants.  Generally, they have a merchant's name or initials, sometimes a town and state, and a value legend (such as \"good for 5\u00a2\" or other denomination) somewhere on the token. Merchants that issued tokens included general stores, grocers, department stores, dairies, meat markets, drug stores, saloons, bars, taverns, barbers, coal mines, lumber mills and many other businesses. The era of 1870 through 1920 marked the highest use of \"trade tokens\" in the United States, spurred by the proliferation of small stores in rural areas. There were thousands of small general and merchandise stores all over the United States, and many of them used trade tokens to promote trade and extend credit to customers. Aluminum tokens almost always date after 1890, when low-cost production began.\n\n==Slot machine tokens==\n[[File:Coins-9626.jpg|thumb|right|Token coins in an arcade game.]]\nMetal token coins are used in lieu of cash in some coin-operated [[arcade game]]s and [[casino]] [[slot machine]]s.\n\nMoney is exchanged for the token coins or [[Casino token|chips]] in a casino at the [[casino cage]], at the gaming tables, or at a [[slot machine]] and at a cashier station for slot token coins. The tokens are interchangeable with money at the casino.  They generally have no value outside of the casino.\n\nAfter the increase in the value of silver stopped the circulation of silver coins around 1964, casinos rushed to find a substitute, as most [[slot machine]]s at that time used that particular coin.  The [[Nevada State Gaming Control Board]] consulted with the U.S. Treasury, and casinos were soon allowed to start using their own tokens to operate their slot machines.  The [[Franklin Mint]] was the main minter of casino tokens at that time.\n\nIn 1971, many casinos adopted the [[Eisenhower Dollar]] for use in machines and on tables.  When the dollar was replaced with the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] in 1979, most casinos reinstituted tokens, fearing confusion with quarters and not wishing to extensively retool their slot machines.  Those casinos which still use tokens in slot machines still use Eisenhower-sized ones.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, casinos are not permitted to use currency in slot machines, necessitating tokens for smaller denominations.\n\nTokens are being phased out by many casinos in favor of coinless machines which accept banknotes and print receipts for payout. (These receipts - often nicknamed \"TITOs\" for [[Ticket-in, ticket-out]], can also be inserted into the machines.) In video arcades, they are also being phased out in favor of magnetic cards, which can also count how many tickets one has, allowing arcades to also do away with paper tickets.\n\n==Staff tokens==\n{{Main|Scrip}}\n[[File:Dbcm3s.jpg|thumb|A [[de Beers]] 3[[Old pence sterling|d]] staff salary token given to employees and only usable at their stores.]]\n\nStaff tokens were issued to staff of businesses in lieu of coins.

Dallas' key to growth came in 1873 with the construction of multiple [[Rail road|rail]] lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900, Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in [[cotton gin]] machinery manufacturing.\n\nBy the early 1900s, Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Eleventh Federal Reserve District]]. By 1925, Texas churned out more than \u2153 of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} [[radius]] of Dallas. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered east of Dallas, near [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]]. Dallas' proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], and [[Oklahoma]] in the following years further solidified Dallas' position as the hub of the market.<ref name=\"paynechapV\">{{cite book|last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |isbn= 0-89781-034-1 |pages=189\u2013221 |chapter= Chapter VII: The Emergence of \"Big D\"}}</ref>\n\nThe end of [[World War II]] left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of \"[[Silicon Prairie]]\" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the [[Telecom Corridor]] in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], a northern suburb of Dallas. The Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies<ref>[http://www.telecomcorridor.com/ Telecom Corridor website].

Several of [[Downtown Dallas]]' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and an oil bust brought the 80's building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its sister city Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in Downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses, as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of [[Klyde Warren Park]], built across [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District, so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.\n\nThe residential real estate market in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro area have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing, with rents reaching all-time highs. Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation, were leading the nation since 2015.<ref name=\"Economic Snapshot\">{{cite news|title=DFW Apartment Boom Hits Region|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2015/07/01/dfw-apartment-boom-hits-region-with-all-time.html|newspaper=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Dallas Residential Real Estate\">{{cite news | title = Dallas Area Home Price Growth Dwarfs National Gains | url = https://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | first = Steve | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = June 30, 2015 | access-date = June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not significantly affected Dallas and its greater metro area due to the highly diversified nature of its economy. Dallas, and the DFW metro, continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust. Oil-dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn, but Dallas's growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015. Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave [[California]] and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas area) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to Downtown Dallas helped drive the boom in the Dallas economy.

In addition, [[Dallas Executive Airport]] (formerly Redbird Airport), serves as a [[general aviation]] airport for the city, and [[Addison Airport]] functions similarly just outside the city limits in the suburb of Addison. Two more general aviation airports are about {{convert|35|mi|0}} north of Dallas in [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], and another two are in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], on the west side of the metroplex. [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Alliance Airport]], in far North Fort Worth, is a cargo reliever airport to DFW and general aviation facility.\n\nDFW International Airport is in the suburbs slightly north of and equidistant to Downtown Fort Worth and Downtown Dallas. In terms of size, DFW International is the largest airport in the state, the 2nd largest in the United States, and 9th largest in the world; DFW International Airport is larger than the island of [[Manhattan]].\n\nIn terms of traffic, DFW International is the busiest airport in the state, 4th busiest in the United States, and 11th busiest in the world. The headquarters of [[American Airlines]], the largest air carrier in the world ahead of [[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]], is less than a mile from DFW International within Fort Worth's city limits. Similarly, Love Field is within Dallas's city limits, about {{convert|6|mi|0}} northwest of Downtown, and is headquarters to [[Southwest Airlines]], the largest domestic airline in the United States.\n\n===Transit systems===\n[[File:Mockingbird Station 3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An escalator descends from the street to an island platform station with a white and yellow train present along a landscaped track.|A northbound train at [[SMU/Mockingbird station]]]]\n[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) is the Dallas-area public transportation authority that provides rail, buses and [[HOV]] lanes to commuters.

Dallas' key to growth came in 1873 with the construction of multiple [[Rail road|rail]] lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900, Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in [[cotton gin]] machinery manufacturing.\n\nBy the early 1900s, Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Eleventh Federal Reserve District]]. By 1925, Texas churned out more than \u2153 of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} [[radius]] of Dallas. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered east of Dallas, near [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]]. Dallas' proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], and [[Oklahoma]] in the following years further solidified Dallas' position as the hub of the market.<ref name=\"paynechapV\">{{cite book|last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |isbn= 0-89781-034-1 |pages=189\u2013221 |chapter= Chapter VII: The Emergence of \"Big D\"}}</ref>\n\nThe end of [[World War II]] left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of \"[[Silicon Prairie]]\" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the [[Telecom Corridor]] in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], a northern suburb of Dallas. The Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies<ref>[http://www.telecomcorridor.com/ Telecom Corridor website].

Retrieved October 1, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Dallas was a real estate hotbed, with the increasing metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of [[Downtown Dallas]]' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and an oil bust brought the 80's building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its sister city Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in Downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses, as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of [[Klyde Warren Park]], built across [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District, so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.\n\nThe residential real estate market in the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro area have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing, with rents reaching all-time highs. Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation, were leading the nation since 2015.<ref name=\"Economic Snapshot\">{{cite news|title=DFW Apartment Boom Hits Region|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2015/07/01/dfw-apartment-boom-hits-region-with-all-time.html|newspaper=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Dallas Residential Real Estate\">{{cite news | title = Dallas Area Home Price Growth Dwarfs National Gains | url = https://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | first = Steve | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = June 30, 2015 | access-date = June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not significantly affected Dallas and its greater metro area due to the highly diversified nature of its economy. Dallas, and the DFW metro, continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust. Oil-dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn, but Dallas's growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015. Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave [[California]] and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas area) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to Downtown Dallas helped drive the boom in the Dallas economy.

The word ''''Sood'''' finds a mention in the Vedas at 23 places (15 places in the Rig Ved, 6 places in the Yajur Ved and twice in the Atharva Ved). Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Madhusudan' \u2013 (Sudan means 'sanharak' \u2013 killer of demon Madhu). The Sood community is a very ancient fraternity and some Sood/Sud gotras are merchants as well. \n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Brahmin Rishis were perturbed by the spread of Buddhism across India, because the old Vedic Hindu Dharma was getting a great set back. Hence, the Rishis performed a sacred Yajna at Mount Abu to revive old Hindu Dharma based on the Vedic traditions. The sacred flames of this Agni Kund, incarnated and baptised four Kshatriyas namely \u2013 the Parmar, the Parihar, the Solanki and the Chouhan. These four took a holy vow to re-establish the ancient glory of Hindu Dharma by fighting against the mass change of faith from Hinduism to Buddhism. These four Kshatriyas spread four new branches of Hinduism all over the country. The second son born to Parmar was named Sood and his descendents formed the Sood community. A reference of 44 descendants of Parmar is also available. These sood descendents formed the Sood Dynasty and the capital city of the Sood Dynasty for eight generations was Patten in Sind, now in Pakistan. The capital was later shifted to Alwar and finally King Jai Singh, (son of King Dahar) shifted his capital to Amar Kot, now in Pakistan. There is a reference of 101 Sood Kings or Rajas ruling in different parts of India.

The word ''''Sood'''' finds a mention in the Vedas at 23 places (15 places in the Rig Ved, 6 places in the Yajur Ved and twice in the Atharva Ved). Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Madhusudan' \u2013 (Sudan means 'sanharak' \u2013 killer of demon Madhu). The Sood community is a very ancient fraternity and some Sood/Sud gotras are merchants as well. \n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Brahmin Rishis were perturbed by the spread of Buddhism across India, because the old Vedic Hindu Dharma was getting a great set back. Hence, the Rishis performed a sacred Yajna at Mount Abu to revive old Hindu Dharma based on the Vedic traditions. The sacred flames of this Agni Kund, incarnated and baptised four Kshatriyas namely \u2013 the Parmar, the Parihar, the Solanki and the Chouhan. These four took a holy vow to re-establish the ancient glory of Hindu Dharma by fighting against the mass change of faith from Hinduism to Buddhism. These four Kshatriyas spread four new branches of Hinduism all over the country. The second son born to Parmar was named Sood and his descendents formed the Sood community. A reference of 44 descendants of Parmar is also available. These sood descendents formed the Sood Dynasty and the capital city of the Sood Dynasty for eight generations was Patten in Sind, now in Pakistan. The capital was later shifted to Alwar and finally King Jai Singh, (son of King Dahar) shifted his capital to Amar Kot, now in Pakistan. There is a reference of 101 Sood Kings or Rajas ruling in different parts of India. The Soods established themselves in the North and later got concentrated at Soodpur, now renamed Sirhind.  \n\nDue to the seven invasions of India by Ahmed Shah Abdali between 1748 and 1757 A.D., at Soodpur and gradually into Rajasthan and later of entire India, the Soods fled to different villages and towns in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.<ref name=\"originHistory\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#2|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Gotras or Sub Castes==\nBoth the Punjab section and the Hill section of the Sood community have 52 Gotras or Sub Castes each, many of which are named after the villages they settled in. <ref name=\"Gotras or Sub Castes\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#8|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Punjab section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Badhoo, Balgan, Baranwal, Behal, Beri, Bharak, Bhokaha (or Bhokhi), Bhola, Bodhi, Bourie, Brahmi, Dadan, Dauli (or Deli), Dhalli (or Dhati), Dhanda, Dhaunchak, Dhiri, Dhookhi, Dhoop, Dosaj, Gajri, Gajja (or Gajjey), Gondal (Gandel), Gopal, Goyal, Jandpal (or Janpal), Jari, Kajla (or Kajley), Lau, Mahidhar, Mahiyar (or Mayor), Makaura (or Makaurey), Mandal, Mohindra, Mohni, Mukandi, Momman, Nandoo, Nehra, Paal, Phakka, Pharwaha, Phassi, Poora, Rora, Rohnir, Rodher, Sanwal, Sulhan, Tagaley, Teji, Udhar, Ugal-Virk or Virk and Vassan.\n\nThe Hill section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Bahil, Bajwaria, Banta, Bhagley, Bhagra, Basohal, Basalia, Butail, Chakahria, Chakaseday, Chamib, Chaudhri, Chaukand, Chaujar, Chehray, Chimia, Cheemrey, Chhabb, Chonolia, Dagan, Didi, Dhophmal, Doddal, Dogan, Dorela, Dunyal, Indoria, Harail, Haraloo, Indoria, Jallundhroo, Jaiswal, Jandranglu, Jhalya, Jhangra, Jehelghat, Kalandar, Kandal, Karol, Kataway, Kaunsal, Kutharia, Kuthiala, Lahespar, Lakhanty, Lamsay, Lama, Langey, Lasaria, Laserday, Lauriya, Ling, Mahdoodia, Mangwalich, Mariya, Mand, Masoob, Mehtay, Mithoo, Naggal, Nehdal, Pabba, Panbalia, Paptopay, Patopa, Pulkaha, Phagdey, Phalkolia, Sabloria, Sah, Saraup, Sawali, Shall, Takalo and Udhwal.\n\nThe Soods are organized into city specific chapters of their organization in many countries.

Members of this subfamily are called '''murines'''. This subfamily is larger than all [[mammal]] families except the [[Cricetidae]] and [[Muridae]], and is larger than all [[mammal]] [[order (biology)|order]]s except the [[bat]]s and the remainder of the [[rodent]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 12|year = 2005|isbn = 9780801882210|location = |pages = 1191|url = https://books.google.com/?id=YnYED-YG0ZYC&pg=PA1191&lpg=PA1191&dq=mures+old-world#v=onepage&q=Mures&f=false|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Don E.|last2 = Reeder|first2 = Deeann M.}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Murinae are native to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].  They are the only [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s native to Australia.  They have also been [[invasive species|introduced]] to all continents except [[Antarctica]], and are serious pest animals.  This is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the [[endangered|endangerment]] and [[extinct]]ion of many native animals.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nTwo prominent murine human [[commensalism|commensal]]s have become vital [[laboratory animal]]s.  The [[brown rat]] and [[house mouse]] are both used as medical subjects.\n\nThe murines have a distinctive [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two, the primitive pattern seen most frequently in [[muroid rodent]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Fossils==\nThe first known appearance of the Murinae in the [[fossil]] record is about [[Miocene|14 million years ago]] with the fossil genus ''[[Antemus]]''. ''Antemus'' is thought to derive directly from ''[[Potwarmus]]'', which has a more primitive tooth pattern.  Likewise, two genera, ''[[Progonomys]]'' and ''[[Karnimata]]'', are thought to derive directly from ''Antemus''.  ''Progonomys'' is thought to be the ancestor of ''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]'' and relatives, while ''Karnimata'' is thought to lead to ''[[Rattus]]'' and relatives.  All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated [[Siwalik]] fossil beds of [[Pakistan]]. The transition from ''Potwarmus'' to ''Antemus'' to ''Progonomys'' and ''Karnimata'' is considered an excellent example of [[anagenesis|anagenic evolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nMost of the Murinae have been poorly studied.  Some genera have been grouped, such as the hydromyine water rats, conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice, or the phloeomyine [[Southeast Asia]]n forms.  No [[tribe (biology)|tribal]] level [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has been attempted for the complete subfamily.  It appears as if genera from Southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms.  The [[vlei rat]]s in the genera ''[[Otomys]]'' and ''[[Parotomys]]'' are often placed in a separate subfamily, Otomyinae, but have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness.\n\nThree genera, ''[[Uranomys]]'', ''[[Lophuromys]]'', and ''[[Acomys]]'', were once considered to be murines, but were found to be more closely related to [[gerbil]]s through [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetics]].  They have been assigned a new subfamily status, [[Deomyinae]].\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies of Murinae include Lecompte, et al.

the art glass technique}}\n\nThe '''Old World rats and mice''', part of the [[subfamily]] '''Murinae''' in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Muridae]], comprise at least 519 species. Members of this subfamily are called '''murines'''. This subfamily is larger than all [[mammal]] families except the [[Cricetidae]] and [[Muridae]], and is larger than all [[mammal]] [[order (biology)|order]]s except the [[bat]]s and the remainder of the [[rodent]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 12|year = 2005|isbn = 9780801882210|location = |pages = 1191|url = https://books.google.com/?id=YnYED-YG0ZYC&pg=PA1191&lpg=PA1191&dq=mures+old-world#v=onepage&q=Mures&f=false|last1 = Wilson|first1 = Don E.|last2 = Reeder|first2 = Deeann M.}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Murinae are native to [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]].  They are the only [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s native to Australia.  They have also been [[invasive species|introduced]] to all continents except [[Antarctica]], and are serious pest animals.  This is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the [[endangered|endangerment]] and [[extinct]]ion of many native animals.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nTwo prominent murine human [[commensalism|commensal]]s have become vital [[laboratory animal]]s.  The [[brown rat]] and [[house mouse]] are both used as medical subjects.\n\nThe murines have a distinctive [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two, the primitive pattern seen most frequently in [[muroid rodent]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Fossils==\nThe first known appearance of the Murinae in the [[fossil]] record is about [[Miocene|14 million years ago]] with the fossil genus ''[[Antemus]]''. ''Antemus'' is thought to derive directly from ''[[Potwarmus]]'', which has a more primitive tooth pattern.  Likewise, two genera, ''[[Progonomys]]'' and ''[[Karnimata]]'', are thought to derive directly from ''Antemus''.  ''Progonomys'' is thought to be the ancestor of ''[[Mus (genus)|Mus]]'' and relatives, while ''Karnimata'' is thought to lead to ''[[Rattus]]'' and relatives.  All of these fossils are found in the well-preserved and easily dated [[Siwalik]] fossil beds of [[Pakistan]]. The transition from ''Potwarmus'' to ''Antemus'' to ''Progonomys'' and ''Karnimata'' is considered an excellent example of [[anagenesis|anagenic evolution]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nMost of the Murinae have been poorly studied.  Some genera have been grouped, such as the hydromyine water rats, conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice, or the phloeomyine [[Southeast Asia]]n forms.  No [[tribe (biology)|tribal]] level [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has been attempted for the complete subfamily.  It appears as if genera from Southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms.  The [[vlei rat]]s in the genera ''[[Otomys]]'' and ''[[Parotomys]]'' are often placed in a separate subfamily, Otomyinae, but have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness.\n\nThree genera, ''[[Uranomys]]'', ''[[Lophuromys]]'', and ''[[Acomys]]'', were once considered to be murines, but were found to be more closely related to [[gerbil]]s through [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetics]].  They have been assigned a new subfamily status, [[Deomyinae]].\n\nMolecular phylogenetic studies of Murinae include Lecompte, et al. (2008),<ref>Emilie Lecompte, Ken Aplin, Christiane Denys, Fran\u00e7ois Catzeflis, Marion Chades and Pascale Chevret. 2008. Phylogeny and biogeography of African Murinae based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, with a new tribal classification of the subfamily. BMC Evolutionary Biology2008 8:199 DOI: 10.1186/1471-2148-8-199</ref> which analyzes African murine species based on the mitochondrial [[cytochrome b]] gene and two nuclear gene fragments. Lecompte, et al.

{"title_page": "History of Canada", "text_new": "{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{History of Canada sidebar}}\nThe '''history of toronto''' covers the period from the arrival of [[Paleo-Indians]] thousands of years ago to this day. Prior to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]], the lands encompassing present-day [[Canada]] were inhabited for millennia by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archeological]] investigations.one of the first nations peoples proudest inventions was a type of stool for sitting on which now is called a toilet,it was such a proud invention it lasted to this day.\n\nStarting in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of [[New France]] was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The now British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was divided into [[The Canadas|Upper and Lower Canada]] in 1791 and [[Act of Union 1840|reunified]] in 1841. In 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] was joined with two other British colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new country [[Territorial evolution of Canada|expanded by incorporating other parts]] of [[British North America]], finishing with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1949.\n\nAlthough [[responsible government]] had existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the [[First World War]]. The passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was [[Patriation|patriated]] in 1982'','' the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].\n\nOver centuries, elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] that has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{See also|Timeline of Canadian history|List of years in Canada}}\n\n===Indigenous peoples ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada}}\n{{see|Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC \u2013 AD 1600)}}\n[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Lakes]] are estimated to have been formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), when the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] receded.]]\n[[List of archaeological periods (North America)|Archeological]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous genetic]] evidence indicate that North and South America were the last continents into which [[early human migrations|humans migrated]].<ref name=\"Ph.D.2011\">{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Lawrence |title=Beringia and the Peopling of the New World |editor-first=Alfred J. |editor-last=Andrea Ph.D. |work=World History Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEqaIGsT8SsC&pg=PA99 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-930-6 |page=99}}</ref> During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 50,000\u201317,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move gradually across the Bering land bridge ([[Beringia]]), from [[Siberia]] into northwest North America.<ref name=Goebel>{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |first=Ted |last=Goebel |first2=Michael R. |last2=Waters |first3=Dennis H. |last3=O'Rourke |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf  |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497\u2013502 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref> At that point, they were blocked by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Wynn |title=Canada And Arctic North America: An Environmental History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxGFaFvo2oMC&pg=PA20 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-437-0 |page=20}}<br />{{cite book|author=Laurel Sefton MacDowell|title=An Environmental History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM9TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2104-9|page=14}}<br />{{cite journal |author=Guy Gugliotta |title=When Did Humans Come to the Americas? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-did-humans-come-to-the-americas-4209273/?all |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015 }}</ref> The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas are the subject of an ongoing debate.<ref name=\"Madsen2004\">{{cite book |first=Daryl W. |last=Fedje |display-authors=etal |title=Late Wisconsin Environments and Archaeological Visibility on the Northern Northwest Coast |editor-first=David B. |editor-last=Madsen |work=Entering America: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2EVCRfBzAC&pg=PA125 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-786-8 |page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction |work=Unearthing the Law: Archaeological Legislation on Lands in Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago as at U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBy 16,000 years ago the [[Last Glacial Maximum|glacial melt]] allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

Prior to [[History of colonialism|European colonization]], the lands encompassing present-day [[Canada]] were inhabited for millennia by [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]], with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the time of the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European arrivals]] and have been discovered through [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|archeological]] investigations.\n\nStarting in the late 15th century, [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places within North America in what constitutes present-day Canada. The colony of [[New France]] was claimed in 1534 with permanent settlements beginning in 1608. France ceded nearly all its North American possessions to the United Kingdom in 1763 after the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The now British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was divided into [[The Canadas|Upper and Lower Canada]] in 1791 and [[Act of Union 1840|reunified]] in 1841. In 1867, the [[Province of Canada]] was joined with two other British colonies of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new country [[Territorial evolution of Canada|expanded by incorporating other parts]] of [[British North America]], finishing with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1949.\n\nAlthough [[responsible government]] had existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies until the end of the [[First World War]]. The passing of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was [[Patriation|patriated]] in 1982'','' the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] and is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]].\n\nOver centuries, elements of Indigenous, French, British and more recent [[History of immigration to Canada|immigrant]] customs have combined to form a [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] that has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the [[History of the United States|United States]]. Since the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Canadians]] have supported multilateralism abroad and [[socioeconomic development]] domestically.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{See also|Timeline of Canadian history|List of years in Canada}}\n\n===Indigenous peoples ===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Canada}}\n{{see|Technological and industrial history of Canada#The Stone Age: Fire (14,000 BC \u2013 AD 1600)}}\n[[File:Glacial lakes.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Lakes]] are estimated to have been formed at the end of the [[last glacial period]] (about 10,000 years ago), when the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] receded.]]\n[[List of archaeological periods (North America)|Archeological]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous genetic]] evidence indicate that North and South America were the last continents into which [[early human migrations|humans migrated]].<ref name=\"Ph.D.2011\">{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Lawrence |title=Beringia and the Peopling of the New World |editor-first=Alfred J. |editor-last=Andrea Ph.D. |work=World History Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEqaIGsT8SsC&pg=PA99 |year=2011 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-930-6 |page=99}}</ref> During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], 50,000\u201317,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move gradually across the Bering land bridge ([[Beringia]]), from [[Siberia]] into northwest North America.<ref name=Goebel>{{cite journal |title=The Late Pleistocene Dispersal of Modern Humans in the Americas |first=Ted |last=Goebel |first2=Michael R. |last2=Waters |first3=Dennis H. |last3=O'Rourke |url=http://www.centerfirstamericans.com/cfsa-publications/Science2008.pdf  |year=2008 |doi=10.1126/science.1153569 |accessdate=February 5, 2010 |pmid=18339930 |volume=319 |issue=5869 |journal=Science |pages=1497\u2013502 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1497G|citeseerx=10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref> At that point, they were blocked by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] that covered most of Canada, confining them to Alaska and the Yukon for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Graeme |last=Wynn |title=Canada And Arctic North America: An Environmental History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxGFaFvo2oMC&pg=PA20 |year=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-437-0 |page=20}}<br />{{cite book|author=Laurel Sefton MacDowell|title=An Environmental History of Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM9TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|year=2012|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2104-9|page=14}}<br />{{cite journal |author=Guy Gugliotta |title=When Did Humans Come to the Americas? |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-did-humans-come-to-the-americas-4209273/?all |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2013 |access-date=June 25, 2015 }}</ref> The exact dates and routes of the peopling of the Americas are the subject of an ongoing debate.<ref name=\"Madsen2004\">{{cite book |first=Daryl W. |last=Fedje |display-authors=etal |title=Late Wisconsin Environments and Archaeological Visibility on the Northern Northwest Coast |editor-first=David B. |editor-last=Madsen |work=Entering America: Northeast Asia and Beringia Before the Last Glacial Maximum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2EVCRfBzAC&pg=PA125 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=978-0-87480-786-8 |page=125}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction |work=Unearthing the Law: Archaeological Legislation on Lands in Canada |publisher=Parks Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010 |quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago as at U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nBy 16,000 years ago the [[Last Glacial Maximum|glacial melt]] allowed people to move by land south and east out of Beringia, and into Canada.<ref>{{cite book |first=E.

Report, (it originally awarded the game a 7.5/10 rating), it was described as a 'defensive borefest', going on to criticise the game as frustrating and unbalanced; citing server issues, frustrating game mechanics such as the slow communication between players and the overpowering of AI defending mechanic (a criticism shared by various players online), as well as a general lack of 'fun challenges and rewards' in the popular 'Ultimate Team' mode. Bleacher Report then gave an updated score of 6/10. This view was even shared by former world No. 1 FIFA player 'Fnatic Tekzz', who said a pro event, \"Nobody enjoys playing it.\" Many professional players online have deemed FIFA 20 as one of the most frustrating editions in the history of the franchise, citing the clunky gameplay and balancing issues. \n<ref>https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2881686-fifa-20-re-review-from-early-promise-to-defensive-borefest</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |author=Robert Ramsey |title=Huge FIFA 20 Patch 1.05 Finally Tries to Fix Career Mode, Out Now on PS4 |url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/10/huge_fifa_20_patch_1_05_finally_tries_to_fix_career_mode_out_now_on_ps4 |website=Push Square |accessdate=19 October 2019 |date=16 October 2019}}</ref>\nIn early October 2019, it was reported that some players' personal information was exposed to other gamers.

Jackson and Smith flopped in their roles in 1991, and Zimmer was fired \u2013 apparently on orders from [[Tribune Co.]] CEO [[Donald Grenesko]] in May 1991. [[Jim Essian]], a former journeyman catcher and [[Iowa Cubs]] manager, replaced Zimmer for the remainder of the season.
