The film contrasts the daring work of McComber and his coworkers in the skies above New York with life back home in Kahnawake. It also explains how the Mohawk people living across the [[Saint Lawrence River]] from Montreal first gained their reputation for high steel work in the late 19th century, working on a railway bridge that ran through their land.

The film contrasts the daring work of McComber and his coworkers in the skies above New York with life back home in Kahnawake. It also explains how the Mohawk people living across the [[Saint Lawrence River]] from Montreal first gained their reputation for high steel work in the late 19th century, working on a railway bridge that ran through their land. However, as the film recounts through narration and archival photos, such a reputation came at a terrible cost: while working on the [[Quebec Bridge]] further down river near Quebec City, dozens of Mohawks were among the 75 men killed during its 1907 construction collapse\u2014with a devastating impact on the small community. While celebrating their courage and skill, the film also makes plain how Mohawks are forced to leave home in order to make a living, with McComber regretting that his sons have had to grow up without their father.<ref name=\"Gravestock\">{{cite book | last1 = Gravestock | first1 = Steve | title = Don Owen: Notes on a Filmmaker and His Culture | date = 2005 | publisher = Indiana University Press| isbn = 9780968913246 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/donowennotesonfi00grav_0/page/41 41]\u201343 | url = https://archive.org/details/donowennotesonfi00grav_0 | url-access = registration | quote = High Steel Don Owen. | accessdate = 4 June 2017 | language = en }}</ref><ref name=\"zoe\">{{cite book|last1=Druick|first1=Zo\u00eb|title=Projecting Canada: Government Policy and Documentary Film at the National Film Board|date=2007|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773576698|pages=109|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qurNIAXK8HIC&pg=PA109&dq=%22High+Steel%22+%22Don+Owen%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy3se3y6TUAhXn34MKHfuIBsIQ6AEIPTAE#v=onepage&q=%22High%20Steel%22%20%22Don%20Owen%22&f=false|accessdate=4 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"POV\">{{cite news|title=The Lost Canadian: Don Owen|url=http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/the-lost-canadian-don-owen|accessdate=4 June 2017|issue=59|work=Point of View Magazine|publisher=[[Documentary Organization of Canada]]|date=1 October 2005|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film's director of photography was [[John Spotton]], with [[Don Francks]] as narrator, [[Julian Biggs]] as producer, and with a song by [[Bruce Mackay]], \"Mountains of Iron and Steel\" (replacing [[Gordon Lightfoot]], who was originally supposed to have provided music).

The film was a tribute to Canadian [[war correspondent]]s who reported from the front lines in the [[World War II|Second World War]].{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nFrom the first days of the Second World War, broadcasters and journalists brought the latest war news back to a public in Canada desperate for any news. All the major news outlets sent war correspondents who would report from the front lines, often putting themselves in danger. All the significant Canadian operations overseas from the [[Battle of Britain]], [[Battle of the Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] as well as the [[Normandy landings]] have had front-line coverage from Canadian war correspondents.\n\nBesides the headline hunters who wrote for newspapers, the ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (CBC) and [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) send teams of cinematographers and broadcasters producing radio and newsreel broadcasts.  Wherever Canadians are in battle. the war correspondents can be found flying with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], on the seas with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] or in an armoured vehicle with the [[Canadian Army]],\n\nIn order to relay the war news from the front, a complex organization is behind the correspondents from the military Directors of Public Relations, the censors, dispatch riders, engineers, and the Canadian Press and British United Press offices. Close cooperation with their counterparts in the Canadian military is also crucial to getting the news back to Canada.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* Journalist [[Ross Munro]] as Himself (archival footage) \n* Journalist [[Ralph Allen (journalist)|Ralph Allen]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist [[Lionel Shapiro]] Allen Kent as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist Gregory Clark as Himself (archival footage)\n* Wing Commander Joe Clarke as Himself (archival footage)\n* Colonel William Abel as Himself (archival footage)\n* Colonel Dick Malone as Himself (archival footage)\n* Colonel Frank Walker as Himself (archival footage)\n* Commander Peter McWitchey as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist [[Matthew Halton]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist Peter Stursberg as Himself (archival footage) {{#tag:ref|The voices of Matthew Halton, Benoit Lafleur and Bill Herbert are heard on a ''CBC'' radio broadcast.|group=Note}}\n* {{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nTypical of many of the NFB's Second World War documentary short films, ''Headline Hunters'' was created as a [[tutorial|information film]] with a limited [[propaganda]] message.<ref name=\"CFE\"/> The film was a [[compilation documentary]] that incorporated [[newsreel]] footage shot by the Canadian armed forces, especially, the [[Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit]] in Great Britain and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] film units.

The [[short film]] was made by the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. The film was a tribute to Canadian [[war correspondent]]s who reported from the front lines in the [[World War II|Second World War]].{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nFrom the first days of the Second World War, broadcasters and journalists brought the latest war news back to a public in Canada desperate for any news. All the major news outlets sent war correspondents who would report from the front lines, often putting themselves in danger. All the significant Canadian operations overseas from the [[Battle of Britain]], [[Battle of the Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] as well as the [[Normandy landings]] have had front-line coverage from Canadian war correspondents.\n\nBesides the headline hunters who wrote for newspapers, the ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' (CBC) and [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) send teams of cinematographers and broadcasters producing radio and newsreel broadcasts.  Wherever Canadians are in battle. the war correspondents can be found flying with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], on the seas with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] or in an armoured vehicle with the [[Canadian Army]],\n\nIn order to relay the war news from the front, a complex organization is behind the correspondents from the military Directors of Public Relations, the censors, dispatch riders, engineers, and the Canadian Press and British United Press offices. Close cooperation with their counterparts in the Canadian military is also crucial to getting the news back to Canada.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* Journalist [[Ross Munro]] as Himself (archival footage) \n* Journalist [[Ralph Allen (journalist)|Ralph Allen]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist [[Lionel Shapiro]] Allen Kent as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist Gregory Clark as Himself (archival footage)\n* Wing Commander Joe Clarke as Himself (archival footage)\n* Colonel William Abel as Himself (archival footage)\n* Colonel Dick Malone as Himself (archival footage)\n* Colonel Frank Walker as Himself (archival footage)\n* Commander Peter McWitchey as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist [[Matthew Halton]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* Journalist Peter Stursberg as Himself (archival footage) {{#tag:ref|The voices of Matthew Halton, Benoit Lafleur and Bill Herbert are heard on a ''CBC'' radio broadcast.|group=Note}}\n* {{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nTypical of many of the NFB's Second World War documentary short films, ''Headline Hunters'' was created as a [[tutorial|information film]] with a limited [[propaganda]] message.<ref name=\"CFE\"/> The film was a [[compilation documentary]] that incorporated [[newsreel]] footage shot by the Canadian armed forces, especially, the [[Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit]] in Great Britain and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] film units.

Cartwright, Seeley and Co. Ltd., London, 1894, p. 332 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KlBBAAAAIAAJ]</ref> 1670.  It required that [[Charles II of England]] would convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at some future date and that he would assist [[Louis XIV]] with 60 warships and 4,000 soldiers to help in France's war of conquest against the [[Dutch Republic]]. In exchange, Charles would secretly receive a yearly pension of \u00a3230,000, as well as an extra sum of money when Charles informed the English people of his conversion, and France would send 6,000 French troops if there was ever a rebellion against Charles in England.   The secret treaty was signed by Arlington, Arundell, Clifford and Bellings for England and Colbert de Croissy for France.  Both kings exchanged letters of ratification and kept secret the existence of the treaty.<ref>G.M.D. Howat, ''Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 126\u201332.</ref>  A public treaty of Dover was also negotiated, but it was a screen designed for propaganda purposes and to hide the religious dimension of the secret treaty.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 308.</ref> The [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] was a direct consequence of this treaty.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 302-303.</ref> The actual treaty was published by historians a century later.\n\n\n==Negotiation and provisions==\n[[File:Mignard, possibly after - Henrietta of England - National Portrait Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Henrietta, Charles II's youngest sister, assisted in the negotiations that led to the Secret Treaty of Dover (26 May 1670).<ref>{{citation | first = Stephen | last = Coote | title = Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II | year = 2000 | ISBN = 0-312-22687-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/royalsurvivorlif00coot }}.</ref>]]\nExactly who first proposed the alliance between the two kingdoms is unknown, as is the date when this possibility was first discussed. Although the two nations had secretly discussed forming a closer relationship after [[The Restoration]], and Charles had suggested an Anglo-French treaty,<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 29-30.</ref> Charles' assumption that Louis would prefer such a treaty to one with the Dutch was mistaken, as an English treaty was not necessary for Louis' objectives in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], but one with the Dutch Republic was if war was to be avoided.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'' (2004) pp 65,109.</ref> After the signature of a Franco-Dutch defensive treaty in 1662, relations between England and France continued to deteriorate until a French declaration of war against England in January 1666.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', p 151.</ref>    \n \nDuring the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], mutual suspicion grew between the Dutch and Louis, and following its end and the start of the [[War of Devolution]], both in 1667, a [[Triple Alliance (1668)]] was former between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden 1668 to counter French aggression in the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 299-300.</ref> During 1669, friction between the members of the Triple Alliance convinced Louis that he could detach either England or the Dutch Republic from it and, following an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the Dutch, he was approached by Charles, who used his sister as point of contact, with the offer of an alliance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 300-301.</ref> To begin with, the only participants in the talks  were [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England, and Charles's sister [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], ''[[duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]]''. Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather [[Henry IV of France]]). Henrietta was also Louis's sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Phillippe, ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'']].<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (2nd ed. 1936) vol 1 p 342-44.</ref>\n\nCharles' motives for entering into secret negotiations with France while England was part of the Triple Alliance that was opposed to France have been the subject of considerable discussion. His suggested motives include a desire to have Europe's strongest state as an ally, to make himself politically and financially independent of the English parliament, to ensure that England received a share of the [[Spanish Empire]] if and when it broke up, to use Catholics, and possibly also Protestant dissenters, as a dependable group of supporters to strengthen his monarchy or, finally, to revenge himself on the Dutch and particularly its republican government. However, as Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France in 1668 without abandoning the Triple Alliance, he was not as consistent in opposing the Dutch republican government as Louis was.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 297, 299.</ref> Ever since the signing of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], whose provisions included the marriage of Louis to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], the eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]], and despite Maria Theresa renouncing her inheritance rights, Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife's claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 28, 34.</ref> Accordingly, Louis refused Charles' offer in 1668 as it did not included an agreement to join a French attack on Spain, which Charles was unwilling to concede.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 299.</ref> \n\nIn the early part of 1669, Louis attempted to gain Dutch agreement to his acquiring all or most of the Spanish Netherlands, but the Dutch themselves were anxious to prevent a French army being stationed on or near their frontiers. During the same period, Charles attempted to preserve the Triple Alliance by settling outstanding overseas trade issues with the Dutch, with little success. Charles simultaneously attempted to restart negotiations for a French alliance, but Louis repeated the condition that Britain must join him in attacking the Netherlands. Charles remained unenthusiastic, but his failure to gain the security he sought by other diplomatic means forced him to accept this precondition, subject to substantial French financial assistance. The parties entered into more detailed discussions by December 1669.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 300-302.</ref> During the five months in which detailed terms were being agreed, both parties attempted to reach understandings with Spain: their realisation that Spain might cede the Spanish Netherlands to France in a territorial exchange or act in concert with the Triple Alliance was a strong incentive for Charles and Louis respectively to reach a final agreement.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 303-304.</ref> \n \nBy the secret treaty Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the [[Dutch Republic]] in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic. Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 344-46.</ref>  The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:\n\n{{quote |The King of England will make a public profession of the Catholic faith, and will receive the sum of two millions of crowns, to aid him in this project, from the Most Christian King, in the course of the next six months. The date of this declaration is left absolutely to his own pleasure.  The King of France will faithfully observe the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], as regards Spain, and the King of England will maintain the Treaty of the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in a similar manner.  If new rights to the Spanish monarchy revert to the King of France, the King of England will aid him in maintaining these rights.  The two Kings will declare war against the United Provinces.  The King of France will attack them by land, and will receive the help of 6000 men from England.  The King of England will send 50 men-of-war to sea, and the King of France 30; the combined fleets will be under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s command.  His Britannic Majesty will be content to receive [[Walcheren]], the mouth of the [[Scheldt]], and the isle of [[Cadzand]], as his share of the conquered provinces.  Separate articles will provide for the interests of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]].  The Treaty of Commerce, which has already begun, shall be concluded as promptly as possible.<ref>Andrew Browning, ed. ''English Historical Documents: 1660-1714'' (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1953), pp 863-67 for text; paraphrase by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mignet]] from Julia Ady, ''Madame'' (1894) pp. 332\u201333.</ref>}}\n\nBy Article 7 of the treaty, Charles was only able to secure a vague of promises that the rights and interests of his nephew, William, Prince of Orange, would be respected.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 303.</ref> \n\nThe secret treaty did not in fact become public until 1771 after the historian Sir [[Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet|John Dalrymple]] published its contents in his ''Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland''.<ref>J. P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68.</ref> Had it been published in Charles II's lifetime, the results might have been drastic; considering the enormous effect of [[Titus Oates]]' highly unreliable assertions of a [[Popish Plot]], an even greater backlash might have followed had the English public learned that the King actually obliged himself to turn Catholic and that he was willing to rely on French troops to impose that conversion on his own subjects.\n\n==The \"cover\" treaty==\nThe [[secret treaty]] was signed and sealed in June 1670.  The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France. He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275&ndash;276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nMilitary preparations took some time; Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day. On 14 April 1672 under the Treaty of Stockholm, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising Sweden military support if it were threatened by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. This Franco-Swedish alliance completed in Louis\u2019 diplomatic encirclement of the Republic and ended the Triple Alliance.<ref>Roger Frost, ''The Northern Wars 1558\u20131721 p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] started badly for the Dutch. The French strategy was to invade the Dutch Republic along the line of the River [[Rhine]] where Dutch defences were weakest, outflanking the main defences on the Dutch border with the Spanish Netherlands. Despite warnings about French intentions, the Dutch leader [[Johan de Witt]] mistakenly thought that the war against France and England would be decided at sea, and he prioritised equipping the Dutch fleet while neglecting the eastern frontier fortresses.<ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 179-181, 185</ref> This led to significant early French successes and a near-collapse of the Dutch army, which was forced to retreat behind the inundations of [[The Dutch Water Line]] and offer peace terms that were very favourable to France. The year 1672 is known to the Dutch as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' or 'Year of disaster': the [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)| Orangists]] blamed de Witt who they forced to resign, and they later brutally killed  him and his brother.<ref>C. R. Boxer, ''Some Second Thoughts on the Third Anglo-Dutch War'', p 81.</ref><ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 193, 197-198, 220</ref>\n\nThe breathing space afforded by its retreat behind the inundations, followed by military reforms, recruitment of new troops and unofficial Spanish assistance, enabled the Dutch army led by William III of Orange as its Captain-General, to hold the Dutch Water Line for the rest of 1672 and 1673. Louis was now involved in a war of attrition and faced growing opposition from other European powers. Charles was short of money, as the costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected despite French subsidies, and he faced increasing domestic opposition to the war.<ref>C. R. Boxer, ''Some Second Thoughts on the Third Anglo-Dutch War'', p 72.</ref> Part of this opposition related to English perceptions that the French fleet had stood by while the English fleet bore the brunt of the fighting the Dutch.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', pp 50-1 52.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Solebay]] in 1672, [[Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es|d'Estr\u00e9es]], commanding the French squadron, avoided the main battle and only engaged a much smaller Dutch force at long-range, earning the condemnation of English, and some of French, officers.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', pp 50-51.</ref> The conduct of the French fleet in the two 1673 Battles of the Schooneveld was undistinguished and, in the final 1673 conflict, the [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]], D'Estr\u00e9es, either through  poor seamanship, or because he had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet should England make peace with the Dutch, failed to engage the Dutch closely.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', p 52.</ref> In addition, Dutch privateers had been much more successful at capturing English merchant ships than English privateers attacking Dutch vessels in this war.<ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 30, 192</ref>\n\nDesperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight. In 1674, largely because of the pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]: this largely restored the pre-war status quo and ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', p 275</ref> The French would continue to fight for four more years. A peace conference was convened at [[Nijmegen]]in 1676, but this made little progress as the French insisted in retaining the Dutch fortress of [[Maastricht]]. However, the conclusion of an Anglo-Dutch defensive treaty in March 1678 convinced Louis to offer peace without the cession any Dutch territory, leading to the signing the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]].<ref>F. L.

More importantly, Louis achieved a diplomatic victory by breaking the European alliance against him.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', pp 296-297</ref> \n\nIn 1672, Charles issued a [[Royal Declaration of Indulgence|Declaration of Indulgence]] which suspended the penal laws against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconforming]] Protestants and also relaxed (but did not suspend) the penal laws applying to Roman Catholics.  When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament. Furthermore, they refused to fund the ongoing [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] until the declaration was withdrawn. Charles was forced to comply with Parliament's demands, thereby ending the chance offered by the treaty of reconciling England with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 354-55, 365-68.</ref>\n\nThe treaty's reference to the possibility of \"new rights to the Spanish monarchy reverting to the King of France\" envisaged the possibility of [[Charles II of Spain]] dying childless, and of Louis then claiming the Spanish throne for the House of Bourbon through his wife. At the time of the treaty, the Spanish monarch was only nine years old, but his infirmity was already evident and well-known, casting doubt on his ever being able to beget children. However, Charles' promise to Louis was purely personal, and as the Spanish King outlived him, his promise had no effect.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', pp 309-310</ref> When, shortly after the conclusion of the [[Nine Years' War]], the death of Charles II of Spain seemed imminent, the exhausted participants agreed by the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)| First Partition Treaty of 1698]], brokered by William III, that [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria]] would succeed to the Spanish throne, and that France and Austria would divide Spain's European possessions outside the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. After Joseph Ferdinand's death in 1699, the [[Treaty of London (1700)| Second Partition Treaty]] of 1700, also sponsored by William III awarded Spain and its overseas possessions to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]] and most of Spain's European possessions to France. However, when the Spanish king died dying childless in 1700, William III's foreign policy initiative was nullified when Louis claimed the whole Spanish inheritance for his grandson, and French ambitions caused the [[War of Spanish Succession]].<ref>C.

Firstly, he underestimated the political skill of Louis, who involved him a war of little advantage to England but one that was greatly desired by Louis to further his objectives. Secondly, he also underestimated Dutch resilience and overestimated his influence on William, who gained power in the Netherlands without Charles' assistance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 318.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of treaties]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation | last = Ady | first = Julia | title = Madame, a Life of Henrietta, Daughter of Charles I and Duchess of Orleans |  publisher = Seeley & Co | place = London | year = 1894 | pages = 332\u201333 | url = https://archive.org/stream/madamealifehenr02adygoog#page/n354/mode/2up}}.\n* Black, Jeremy. \"British Foreign Policy and International Affairs during Sir William Trumbull's Career.\" ''The British Library Journal'' 19.2 (1993): 199-217.\n* {{cite journal|last=Boxer|first=C.

It required that [[Charles II of England]] would convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] at some future date and that he would assist [[Louis XIV]] with 60 warships and 4,000 soldiers to help in France's war of conquest against the [[Dutch Republic]]. In exchange, Charles would secretly receive a yearly pension of \u00a3230,000, as well as an extra sum of money when Charles informed the English people of his conversion, and France would send 6,000 French troops if there was ever a rebellion against Charles in England.   The secret treaty was signed by Arlington, Arundell, Clifford and Bellings for England and Colbert de Croissy for France.  Both kings exchanged letters of ratification and kept secret the existence of the treaty.<ref>G.M.D. Howat, ''Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 126\u201332.</ref>  A public treaty of Dover was also negotiated, but it was a screen designed for propaganda purposes and to hide the religious dimension of the secret treaty.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 308.</ref> The [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] was a direct consequence of this treaty.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 302-303.</ref> The actual treaty was published by historians a century later.\n\n\n==Negotiation and provisions==\n[[File:Mignard, possibly after - Henrietta of England - National Portrait Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Henrietta, Charles II's youngest sister, assisted in the negotiations that led to the Secret Treaty of Dover (26 May 1670).<ref>{{citation | first = Stephen | last = Coote | title = Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II | year = 2000 | ISBN = 0-312-22687-X | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/royalsurvivorlif00coot }}.</ref>]]\nExactly who first proposed the alliance between the two kingdoms is unknown, as is the date when this possibility was first discussed. Although the two nations had secretly discussed forming a closer relationship after [[The Restoration]], and Charles had suggested an Anglo-French treaty,<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 29-30.</ref> Charles' assumption that Louis would prefer such a treaty to one with the Dutch was mistaken, as an English treaty was not necessary for Louis' objectives in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], but one with the Dutch Republic was if war was to be avoided.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'' (2004) pp 65,109.</ref> After the signature of a Franco-Dutch defensive treaty in 1662, relations between England and France continued to deteriorate until a French declaration of war against England in January 1666.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', p 151.</ref>    \n \nDuring the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], mutual suspicion grew between the Dutch and Louis, and following its end and the start of the [[War of Devolution]], both in 1667, a [[Triple Alliance (1668)]] was former between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden 1668 to counter French aggression in the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 299-300.</ref> During 1669, friction between the members of the Triple Alliance convinced Louis that he could detach either England or the Dutch Republic from it and, following an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the Dutch, he was approached by Charles, who used his sister as point of contact, with the offer of an alliance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 300-301.</ref> To begin with, the only participants in the talks  were [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England, and Charles's sister [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], ''[[duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]]''. Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather [[Henry IV of France]]). Henrietta was also Louis's sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Phillippe, ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'']].<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (2nd ed. 1936) vol 1 p 342-44.</ref>\n\nCharles' motives for entering into secret negotiations with France while England was part of the Triple Alliance that was opposed to France have been the subject of considerable discussion. His suggested motives include a desire to have Europe's strongest state as an ally, to make himself politically and financially independent of the English parliament, to ensure that England received a share of the [[Spanish Empire]] if and when it broke up, to use Catholics, and possibly also Protestant dissenters, as a dependable group of supporters to strengthen his monarchy or, finally, to revenge himself on the Dutch and particularly its republican government. However, as Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France in 1668 without abandoning the Triple Alliance, he was not as consistent in opposing the Dutch republican government as Louis was.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 297, 299.</ref> Ever since the signing of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], whose provisions included the marriage of Louis to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], the eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]], and despite Maria Theresa renouncing her inheritance rights, Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife's claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 28, 34.</ref> Accordingly, Louis refused Charles' offer in 1668 as it did not included an agreement to join a French attack on Spain, which Charles was unwilling to concede.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 299.</ref> \n\nIn the early part of 1669, Louis attempted to gain Dutch agreement to his acquiring all or most of the Spanish Netherlands, but the Dutch themselves were anxious to prevent a French army being stationed on or near their frontiers. During the same period, Charles attempted to preserve the Triple Alliance by settling outstanding overseas trade issues with the Dutch, with little success. Charles simultaneously attempted to restart negotiations for a French alliance, but Louis repeated the condition that Britain must join him in attacking the Netherlands. Charles remained unenthusiastic, but his failure to gain the security he sought by other diplomatic means forced him to accept this precondition, subject to substantial French financial assistance. The parties entered into more detailed discussions by December 1669.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 300-302.</ref> During the five months in which detailed terms were being agreed, both parties attempted to reach understandings with Spain: their realisation that Spain might cede the Spanish Netherlands to France in a territorial exchange or act in concert with the Triple Alliance was a strong incentive for Charles and Louis respectively to reach a final agreement.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 303-304.</ref> \n \nBy the secret treaty Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the [[Dutch Republic]] in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic. Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 344-46.</ref>  The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:\n\n{{quote |The King of England will make a public profession of the Catholic faith, and will receive the sum of two millions of crowns, to aid him in this project, from the Most Christian King, in the course of the next six months. The date of this declaration is left absolutely to his own pleasure.  The King of France will faithfully observe the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], as regards Spain, and the King of England will maintain the Treaty of the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in a similar manner.  If new rights to the Spanish monarchy revert to the King of France, the King of England will aid him in maintaining these rights.  The two Kings will declare war against the United Provinces.  The King of France will attack them by land, and will receive the help of 6000 men from England.  The King of England will send 50 men-of-war to sea, and the King of France 30; the combined fleets will be under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s command.  His Britannic Majesty will be content to receive [[Walcheren]], the mouth of the [[Scheldt]], and the isle of [[Cadzand]], as his share of the conquered provinces.  Separate articles will provide for the interests of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]].  The Treaty of Commerce, which has already begun, shall be concluded as promptly as possible.<ref>Andrew Browning, ed. ''English Historical Documents: 1660-1714'' (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1953), pp 863-67 for text; paraphrase by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mignet]] from Julia Ady, ''Madame'' (1894) pp. 332\u201333.</ref>}}\n\nBy Article 7 of the treaty, Charles was only able to secure a vague of promises that the rights and interests of his nephew, William, Prince of Orange, would be respected.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" p. 303.</ref> \n\nThe secret treaty did not in fact become public until 1771 after the historian Sir [[Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet|John Dalrymple]] published its contents in his ''Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland''.<ref>J. P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68.</ref> Had it been published in Charles II's lifetime, the results might have been drastic; considering the enormous effect of [[Titus Oates]]' highly unreliable assertions of a [[Popish Plot]], an even greater backlash might have followed had the English public learned that the King actually obliged himself to turn Catholic and that he was willing to rely on French troops to impose that conversion on his own subjects.\n\n==The \"cover\" treaty==\nThe [[secret treaty]] was signed and sealed in June 1670.  The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France. He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275&ndash;276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nMilitary preparations took some time; Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day. On 14 April 1672 under the Treaty of Stockholm, France paid Sweden subsidies to remain neutral, while also promising Sweden military support if it were threatened by [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. This Franco-Swedish alliance completed in Louis\u2019 diplomatic encirclement of the Republic and ended the Triple Alliance.<ref>Roger Frost, ''The Northern Wars 1558\u20131721 p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] started badly for the Dutch. The French strategy was to invade the Dutch Republic along the line of the River [[Rhine]] where Dutch defences were weakest, outflanking the main defences on the Dutch border with the Spanish Netherlands. Despite warnings about French intentions, the Dutch leader [[Johan de Witt]] mistakenly thought that the war against France and England would be decided at sea, and he prioritised equipping the Dutch fleet while neglecting the eastern frontier fortresses.<ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 179-181, 185</ref> This led to significant early French successes and a near-collapse of the Dutch army, which was forced to retreat behind the inundations of [[The Dutch Water Line]] and offer peace terms that were very favourable to France. The year 1672 is known to the Dutch as the ''[[Rampjaar]]'' or 'Year of disaster': the [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)| Orangists]] blamed de Witt who they forced to resign, and they later brutally killed  him and his brother.<ref>C. R. Boxer, ''Some Second Thoughts on the Third Anglo-Dutch War'', p 81.</ref><ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 193, 197-198, 220</ref>\n\nThe breathing space afforded by its retreat behind the inundations, followed by military reforms, recruitment of new troops and unofficial Spanish assistance, enabled the Dutch army led by William III of Orange as its Captain-General, to hold the Dutch Water Line for the rest of 1672 and 1673. Louis was now involved in a war of attrition and faced growing opposition from other European powers. Charles was short of money, as the costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected despite French subsidies, and he faced increasing domestic opposition to the war.<ref>C. R. Boxer, ''Some Second Thoughts on the Third Anglo-Dutch War'', p 72.</ref> Part of this opposition related to English perceptions that the French fleet had stood by while the English fleet bore the brunt of the fighting the Dutch.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', pp 50-1 52.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Solebay]] in 1672, [[Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es|d'Estr\u00e9es]], commanding the French squadron, avoided the main battle and only engaged a much smaller Dutch force at long-range, earning the condemnation of English, and some of French, officers.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', pp 50-51.</ref> The conduct of the French fleet in the two 1673 Battles of the Schooneveld was undistinguished and, in the final 1673 conflict, the [[Battle of Texel|Battle of the Texel]], D'Estr\u00e9es, either through  poor seamanship, or because he had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet should England make peace with the Dutch, failed to engage the Dutch closely.<ref>E. H. Jenkins, ''A History of the French Navy'', p 52.</ref> In addition, Dutch privateers had been much more successful at capturing English merchant ships than English privateers attacking Dutch vessels in this war.<ref>J. R. Jones, ''The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the Seventeenth Century'', pp 30, 192</ref>\n\nDesperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight. In 1674, largely because of the pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]: this largely restored the pre-war status quo and ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War.<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', p 275</ref> The French would continue to fight for four more years. A peace conference was convened at [[Nijmegen]]in 1676, but this made little progress as the French insisted in retaining the Dutch fortress of [[Maastricht]]. However, the conclusion of an Anglo-Dutch defensive treaty in March 1678 convinced Louis to offer peace without the cession any Dutch territory, leading to the signing the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]].<ref>F. L. Carsten, ''The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 5'', p 219</ref> Although not unfavourable to the Dutch, and less favourable to France than the terms offered by the Dutch in 1672, France gained [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and several towns in the Spanish Netherlands by this treaty, although relinquishing other conquests. More importantly, Louis achieved a diplomatic victory by breaking the European alliance against him.<ref>F. L.

When Parliament reconvened that year, they denounced the Declaration and announced that the English monarch did not possess the power to issue proclamations that suspended penal laws passed by the Parliament.

The [[Canadian French|French]] version of ''Gateway to Asia'' is ''Au seuil du Pacifique''.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nBefore the [[World War II|war]], British Columbia was treated as a unique \"back door\" to the Pacific and considered by many as one of Canada's playgrounds. Visitors were often enchanted by the scenery but were not aware of the rich bounty of the region including forests, mountains and the sea. The lumber and [[pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]] industries represent the greatest livelihood for thousands of B.C. citizens. The fast-growing mining industry with its roots back to [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] days and the extensive commercial [[fishing industry|fisheries]] which provide more than 1/2 the fish production in Canada, are also important.\n\nIn wartime, the population of British Columbia has utilized its vast natural resources and industrial strength to become a critical factor in Canada's war effort. From its shipyards comes nearly 3/4s of all the Canadian ships constructed in the Second World War. Its residents have made a substantial contribution to the [[Home front during World War II|home front]] workforce. Although there is a diverse population in Canada's most westerly province, 70% of its people have British origins. Other ethnic group make up the province's population include Japanese- and Chinese-Canadians as well as a significant number of Sikhs.\n\nWith the outbreak of a [[Pacific War]], however, major ramifications were caused in B.C.'s population, especially among the large numbers of Japanese-Canadians. Overnight, the 22,000 citizens of Japanese background were [[Japanese-Canadian internment|removed from the Pacific coast and their property seized]].\n\nBritish Columbia provides a vital link between the rest of Canada and its neighbours in the Far East, Asia and Russia. The use of the [[Northwest Staging Route]] with airstrips, [[airport]]s and radio ranging stations built in [[Alberta]], the [[Yukon]] and British Columbia was a  \"skyway\" to Asia. The aircraft that flew this route not only supplied the ongoing construction of the Alaska Highway but also served to ferry American [[lend-lease]] [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|aircraft]] for the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Union Air Forces]] from the United States to Alaska, and then across the [[Bering Strait]] to [[Siberia]].\n\nAt the threshold of a new age, with the advent of high-speed air travel, Canada's Pacific gateway to Asia, will also become a new international trade route to connect to over 1/2 of the people of the world.\n\n==Cast==\n* General [[Andrew McNaughton|A.G.L.

The [[Canadian French|French]] version of ''Gateway to Asia'' is ''Au seuil du Pacifique''.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nBefore the [[World War II|war]], British Columbia was treated as a unique \"back door\" to the Pacific and considered by many as one of Canada's playgrounds. Visitors were often enchanted by the scenery but were not aware of the rich bounty of the region including forests, mountains and the sea. The lumber and [[pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]] industries represent the greatest livelihood for thousands of B.C. citizens. The fast-growing mining industry with its roots back to [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] days and the extensive commercial [[fishing industry|fisheries]] which provide more than 1/2 the fish production in Canada, are also important.\n\nIn wartime, the population of British Columbia has utilized its vast natural resources and industrial strength to become a critical factor in Canada's war effort. From its shipyards comes nearly 3/4s of all the Canadian ships constructed in the Second World War. Its residents have made a substantial contribution to the [[Home front during World War II|home front]] workforce. Although there is a diverse population in Canada's most westerly province, 70% of its people have British origins. Other ethnic group make up the province's population include Japanese- and Chinese-Canadians as well as a significant number of Sikhs.\n\nWith the outbreak of a [[Pacific War]], however, major ramifications were caused in B.C.'s population, especially among the large numbers of Japanese-Canadians. Overnight, the 22,000 citizens of Japanese background were [[Japanese-Canadian internment|removed from the Pacific coast and their property seized]].\n\nBritish Columbia provides a vital link between the rest of Canada and its neighbours in the Far East, Asia and Russia. The use of the [[Northwest Staging Route]] with airstrips, [[airport]]s and radio ranging stations built in [[Alberta]], the [[Yukon]] and British Columbia was a  \"skyway\" to Asia. The aircraft that flew this route not only supplied the ongoing construction of the Alaska Highway but also served to ferry American [[lend-lease]] [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|aircraft]] for the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Union Air Forces]] from the United States to Alaska, and then across the [[Bering Strait]] to [[Siberia]].\n\nAt the threshold of a new age, with the advent of high-speed air travel, Canada's Pacific gateway to Asia, will also become a new international trade route to connect to over 1/2 of the people of the world.\n\n==Cast==\n* General [[Andrew McNaughton|A.G.L.

However, a strong point of Nehemiah was that he would draw the defense into deep coverage whenever he was on the field.

Although he was part of the [[Super Bowl]] winning team in the [[Super Bowl XIX|1984]] season, he did not play a major role.

This military expedition marks the end of a troubled era for Italy during the 20th Century. Despite its origins as an early civilization and nearly 3,000 years of advances in arts and culture, Italians have faced an uncertain future.\n\nDuring the turn-of-the-century, impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the United States and Canada, making their mark in many ways, including as scientists, artists and sports figures. In Italy, after the [[World War I|First World War]], chaotic economies led to the rise of fascism. The emergence of Benito Mussolini as the new political and military dictator thrust Italy into a series of foreign entanglements, in an attempt to reinvigorate the nation.\n\nAfter invasion and conquest of [[Ethiopia]], Mussolini aligned with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a campaign of aggression in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] during the Second World War.\n\nBy 1943, Italian defeats in Africa with the resulting massive numbers of captured troops by Allied forces, have been characterized as the \"African disease\". Naval and aerial armadas massing for an attack on Italy, mean the end for Mussolini's deluded dreams of a new Italian empire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Benito Mussolini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Bruno Mussolini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Rachele Mussolini]] as Herself (archival footage)\n* [[Pope Pius XII]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joseph Goebbels]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Galeazzo Ciano]]  as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[General]] [[Pietro Badoglio]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joe DiMaggio]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Tony Canzoneri]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Arturo Toscanini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Governor General]] [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|arl of Athlone]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Calvin Coolidge]] as Himself (archival footage)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Gates of Italy'' was the part of the wartime ''Canada Carries On'' and ''The World in Action'' [[propaganda film|propaganda]] [[short film]] series, produced with financial backing from the [[Wartime Information Board]] for the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.<ref name=\"Tribune\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/37352863/ \"Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women.\"]''The Winnipeg Tribune'', April 18, 1941.

This military expedition marks the end of a troubled era for Italy during the 20th Century. Despite its origins as an early civilization and nearly 3,000 years of advances in arts and culture, Italians have faced an uncertain future.\n\nDuring the turn-of-the-century, impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the United States and Canada, making their mark in many ways, including as scientists, artists and sports figures. In Italy, after the [[World War I|First World War]], chaotic economies led to the rise of fascism. The emergence of Benito Mussolini as the new political and military dictator thrust Italy into a series of foreign entanglements, in an attempt to reinvigorate the nation.\n\nAfter invasion and conquest of [[Ethiopia]], Mussolini aligned with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a campaign of aggression in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] during the Second World War.\n\nBy 1943, Italian defeats in Africa with the resulting massive numbers of captured troops by Allied forces, have been characterized as the \"African disease\". Naval and aerial armadas massing for an attack on Italy, mean the end for Mussolini's deluded dreams of a new Italian empire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Benito Mussolini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Bruno Mussolini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Rachele Mussolini]] as Herself (archival footage)\n* [[Pope Pius XII]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Adolf Hitler]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joseph Goebbels]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Galeazzo Ciano]]  as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[General]] [[Pietro Badoglio]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joe DiMaggio]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Tony Canzoneri]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Arturo Toscanini]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Governor General]] [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|arl of Athlone]] as Himself (archival footage)\n* [[Calvin Coolidge]] as Himself (archival footage)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Gates of Italy'' was the part of the wartime ''Canada Carries On'' and ''The World in Action'' [[propaganda film|propaganda]] [[short film]] series, produced with financial backing from the [[Wartime Information Board]] for the Director of Public Information, Herbert Lash.<ref name=\"Tribune\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/37352863/ \"Recognize leadership of Winnipeg women.\"]''The Winnipeg Tribune'', April 18, 1941.
