district in an urban area in northern [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]).\n\n==Geography and climate==\nZhonghe lies just south-west of [[Taipei|Taipei City]] and shares borders with [[Banqiao District|Banqiao]], [[Xindian District|Xindian]], [[Tucheng District|Tucheng]] and [[Yonghe District|Yonghe]] Districts of [[New Taipei City]], as well as Taipei City. The average annual temperature is {{convert|21.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and the precipitation averages {{convert|2,111|mm|in}} per year. Most of Zhonghe lies a few tens of meters above sea level and is heavily urbanized, with forested hillier country in the southeast. A mountainous ridge forms most of the eastern border with Xindian, which includes the highest point in Zhonghe, the 302-meter Fenglusai ({{zh|t=\u98a8\u7210\u585e\u5c71|p=F\u0113ngl\u00fas\u00e0i Sh\u0101n}}).<ref>{{citation|isbn=978-986009391-9|title=\u53f0\u5317\u7e23\u4e2d\u548c\u5e02\u884c\u653f\u5340\u57df\u5716 (Jhonghe, Taipei County)|publisher=Ministry of the Interior|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe present-day area of Zhonghe District was originally settled by [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal tribes]]. During conflict between the colonial forces of the Dutch and the Spanish, the area is recorded by the Dutch as '''Chiron''', from the name of one of the tribes living there.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=zh:\u8af8\u7f85\u7e23\u5fd7 |trans-title=Zhuluo County Annals |language=zh}}</ref> This name is preserved in one of the constituent villages of the city, called ''Xiulang Li'' ({{lang|zh|\u79c0\u6717\u91cc}}), and the bridge which connects Zhonghe to Xindian.\n\nThe area was subsequently settled by [[Han Chinese]] migrants from [[Fujian]] but remained relatively unimportant until the end of the [[Second World War]]. In 1946 the population of the area of present-day Zhonghe and [[Yonghe District|Yonghe]] was 30,000 and it was classified as a [[township (Republic of China)|rural township]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.junghe.tpc.gov.tw/History.aspx |title=History |publisher=Zhonghe City Government |accessdate=2008-07-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313054333/http://www.junghe.tpc.gov.tw/History.aspx |archivedate=2008-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDue to rapid population growth Yonghe was separated from Zhonghe in 1958. Subsequently, on January 1, 1979, Zhonghe was upgraded to [[county-controlled city]] status after reaching a population of 170,000.<ref name=\"History\" /> On 25 December 2010, due to the changing from Taipei [[County (Taiwan)|County]] to New Taipei [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|City]], Zhonghe City was changed to Zhonghe [[District (Taiwan)|District]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nZhonghe is divided into 93 villages, which are further subdivided into ''l\u00edn'' ({{zh|c=\u9130|l=neighbourhoods|labels=no}}), of which there are 2,972 in total. Some administration is shared with neighbouring Yonghe District; due to both this and their proximity, they are sometimes collectively known as '''Shuanghe''' ({{zh|c=\u96d9\u548c|l=Twin ''He''|labels=no}}). This is also reflected in the names of various institutions such as Shuang-Ho Hospital<ref>{{citation|url=http://enoffical.shh.org.tw/enUI/A/A10100.aspx|title=About SHH|publisher=Shuang Ho Hospital|access-date=2012-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817083959/http://enoffical.shh.org.tw/enUI/A/A10100.aspx|archive-date=2013-08-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> in Zhonghe and Shuanghe Libai Church<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.shchurch.org.tw/ezportal/homeweb/catalog.php?infoscatid=17|language=Chinese|script-title=zh:\u672c\u5802\u7c21\u4ecb |trans-title=Introduction to the Church |publisher=Shuanghe Libai Church}}</ref> in Yonghe.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Rail===\nZhonghe is served by the [[Zhonghe\u2013Xinlu line]] of the [[Taipei Metro]], three stations of which are located in the city: [[Yongan Market station|Yongan Market]], [[Jingan station|Jingan]] and the terminal station, [[Nanshijiao station|Nanshijiao]]. Scheduled to begin operation in June 2018, the [[Circular line (Taipei Metro)|Circular line]] will add a further five metro stations in Zhonghe, and transform Jingan Station into an interchange station between the Circular and Zhonghe lines. Further into the future, the [[Wanda\u2013Zhonghe\u2013Shulin line]] and the North-South section of the [[Yellow line (Taipei Metro)|Yellow line]] will eventually bring the number of MRT stations in Zhonghe to fifteen. The closest regular rail and high-speed services are from [[Banqiao station]] in neighbouring [[Banqiao District]].\n\n===Road===\nZhonghe has an interchange on one of Taiwan's two main north-south road arteries; the [[National Highway 3 (Taiwan)|National Highway 3]]. Also providing road links is [[Provincial Highway No. 64 (Taiwan)|Provincial Highway 64]], an elevated expressway that cuts through the middle of the district, with several on and off-ramps in Zhonghe itself. There are two bridges over the [[Xindian River]]; Xiulang Bridge, which connects Zhonghe with [[Xindian District|Xindian]], and Huazhong Bridge, reaching [[Taipei]]'s [[Wanhua District]].\n\n==Education==\nZhonghe is home to the [[National Taiwan Library]], which is located in the grounds of the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis|8-23]] Memorial Park. It has one of the best collections in Taiwan of factual books about Taiwan in English.\n\nThere are nine elementary schools, five junior high schools, four senior high schools (2 public and 2 private high schools) in Zhonghe.

The Obukhov length (<math>L</math>), a characteristic length scale of surface layer turbulence derived by Obukhov in 1946,<ref name=o71/> is used for non-dimensional scaling of the actual height.

The Obukhov length was formulated using Richardson's criterion for dynamic stability.<ref name=o71>{{cite journal|last=Obukhov|first=A.

Therefore, the Obukhov length can also be defined as,<ref name=f08>{{cite book|last=Foken|first=Thomas|title=Micrometeorology|date=2008|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-540-74665-2|pages=42\u201349}}</ref>\n\n<math>\nL=-\\dfrac{u_*^3}{\\kappa \\dfrac{g}{\\overline{\\theta_v}}\\overline{w'\\theta_v'}}\n</math>\n\nThe Obukhov length also acts as a criterion for the static stability of surface layer. When <math>L<0</math>, the surface layer is statically unstable, and when <math>L>0</math> the surface layer is statically stable. The absolute magnitude of <math>L</math> indicates the deviation from statically neutral state, with smaller <math>|L|</math> values corresponding to larger deviations from neutral conditions. When <math>|L|</math> is small and <math>L<0</math>, buoyant processes dominate the production of turbulent kinetic energy compared with shear production. By definition, under neutral conditions <math>L\\rightarrow\\infty</math>. \nThe Obukhov length <math>L</math> is used for non-dimensionalization of height <math>z</math> in similarity theory.\n\n== Governing formulae for similarity relations ==\nM\u2013O similarity theory parameterizes fluxes in the surface layer as a function of the dimensionless length parameter <math>\\zeta=z/L</math>. From [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem|the Buckingham Pi theorem]] of dimensional analysis, two dimensionless group can be formed from the basic parameter set <math>\\{ u_*, g/\\overline{\\theta_v}, \\partial\\overline{u}/\\partial z, z, \\overline{w'\\theta_v'}\\}</math>,\n\n<math>\n\\dfrac{\\kappa z}{u_*}\\dfrac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z}\n</math>, and \n<math>\n\\zeta =\\dfrac{z}{L}\n</math>\n\nFrom there, a function <math>\\varphi_M(\\zeta)</math> can be determined to empirically describe the relationship between the two dimensionless quantities, called a universal function. Similarly, <math>\\varphi_H(\\zeta)</math> can be defined for the dimensionless group of mean temperature profile. \nMean wind and temperature profiles therefore satisfy the following relations,<ref name = mo54/><ref name = f06/>\n\n<math>\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z} =\\dfrac{u_*}{\\kappa z}\\varphi_M(\\zeta)\n</math>\n\n<math>\n\\dfrac{\\partial \\overline{\\theta_v}}{\\partial z} =\\dfrac{\\theta_*}{\\kappa z}\\varphi_H(\\zeta)\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta_*= - \\dfrac{\\overline{w'\\theta_v'}}{u_*}</math> is the characteristic dynamical temperature, <math>\\varphi_M</math> and <math>\\varphi_H</math> are the universal functions of momentum and heat. The [[Eddy diffusion|eddy diffusivity]] coefficients for momentum and heat fluxes are defined as follows,\n\n<math>\nK_M = \\kappa z\\dfrac{ u_*}{\\varphi_M(\\zeta)},\\ K_H = \\kappa z\\dfrac{ u_*}{\\varphi_H(\\zeta)}\n</math>\n\n<math>K_M</math> and <math>K_H</math> can be related with the [[turbulent Prandtl number]] <math>Pr_t</math>,\n\n<math>\n\\dfrac{K_H}{K_M}=\\dfrac{1}{Pr_t}>1\n</math>\n\nIn reality, the universal functions need to be determined using experimental data when applying M\u2013O similarity theory. Although the choice of universal functions is not unique, certain functional forms have been proposed and are widely accepted for fitting experimental data.\n\n== Universal functions of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory ==\n\n[[File:Universal functions for Monin-Obukhov similarity theory.png|thumb|right|500px|Universal functions for Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]]\n\nSeveral functional forms have been proposed to represent the universal functions of similarity theory. Because the Obukhov length is determined when <math>L\\Big(\\dfrac{\\partial Ri}{\\partial z}\\Big)_{z=0}=1</math>, where <math>Ri</math> is the [[Richardson number]], the following condition must be satisfied by the universal function chosen,<ref name=mo54/>\n\n<math>\n\\varphi(0)=1\n</math>\n\nA first order approximation of the universal function for momentum flux is,\n\n<math>\n\\varphi_M(\\zeta)=1+\\beta\\zeta\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\beta\\approx 6</math>.<ref name=f06/> However this is only applicable when <math>0<\\zeta<1</math>.

The temperature profile was also measured in a similar manner. Results from the Kansas field study indicated that the ratio of eddy diffusivities of heat and momentum was approximately 1.35 under neutral conditions. A similar experiment was conducted in a flat field in northwestern Minnesota in 1973.

Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land to build the school.<ref name=\"History 3a\">{{cite web | title=The Founding of the University: Myths and Heroes| access-date=Aug 11, 2019 | url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the-founding-of-the-university-myths-and-heroes}}</ref> Construction of [[Old Main, University of Arizona|Old Main]], the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.<ref name=\"History 3\">{{cite web | title=The Old Main | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 11, 2006}}</ref> Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Academics==\nThe University of Arizona offers bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

After a 25-year tenure as Arizona head coach, Olson announced his retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008. After two seasons of using interim coaches, Arizona named [[Sean Miller]], head coach at [[Xavier University]], as its new head basketball coach in April 2009. During his tenure to date, Miller has led the Wildcats to seven conference championships and six appearances in the NCAA tournament. Miller has served as head coach for four of the seven seasons in Arizona history in which the Wildcats have won 30 or more games.\n\n====Football====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats football}}\n[[File:Arizona Stadium East Side.jpg|thumb|[[Arizona Stadium]] has a total capacity of 55,675]]\nThe [[American Football|football]] team began at The University of Arizona in 1899 under the nickname \"Varsity\" (a name kept until the 1914 season when the team was deemed the \"Wildcats\").<ref name=\"History 7\">{{cite web | title=The First Football Team \u2013 1899 | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701033605/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe football team was notably successful in the 1990s, under head coach [[Dick Tomey]]; his \"Desert Swarm\" defense was characterized by tough, hard-nosed tactics.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.\n\n====Softball====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}\n\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name=\"LaxCats\">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma.

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Wildcat Family Statue, University of Arizona.jpg|thumb|upright|Wildcat Family Statue]]\n\n===Fraternities and sororities===\nThe University of Arizona recognizes 51 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greek.arizona.edu/|title=UA Fraternity & Sorority Programs|author=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 2, 2019|df=}}</ref> {{as of|2018||df=|lc=|since=}}, more than 16% of students are part of UA's 52-chapter Greek life program.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008. It focuses on pursuing institutionalized sustainability throughout the University of Arizona and the greater Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Students for Sustainability|access-date=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313004014/http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)====\nIn 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the ''de facto'' body representing graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.\n\n====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====\nOn-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body and the 24 individual hall councils.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of nine student leaders that help run the organization. The positions are as follow: President, National Communications Coordinator, the Directors of Business Administration, Operations, Programming, Marketing and Equipment Services, the RHA parliamentarian, the Executive Director of the National Residence Hall Honorary and an advisor. The RHA Executive Board is elected to one-year terms during the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uarha.com/contact |title=Contact Us |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |publisher=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe General Body is composed of representatives from each of the 24 residence halls on campus, the executive board and liaisons from ASUA, Advocates Coming Together and Eco-Reps.

The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

As part of the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed on the existing fifth floor.\n\nThe Special Collections Library is adjacent to the Main Library. It was established in 1958, and it houses materials primarily concerned with Arizona and Southwestern history, borderlands studies, and literature. \n\nThe Weaver Science and Engineering Library is in a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from those fields. The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet music, recordings and listening stations), and photography. There is a small library at the [[Center for Creative Photography]], also in the fine arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography. The Law Library is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law) at the intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue.\n\nThe Arizona Health Sciences Library, built in 1996, is on the Health Sciences Center on the north end of campus and in Phoenix on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, in the Health Sciences Education Building (HSEB). The library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health, the University of Arizona Health Network, and is a resource for health professionals and citizens across the state.\n\n===Academic organizations and centers===\n[[University of Arizona Poetry Center|The University of Arizona Poetry Center]] houses an extensive collection of contemporary poetry.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.\n\n====Softball====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}\n\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name=\"LaxCats\">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma. Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with the [[cheerleading]] squad at most Wildcat sporting events.<ref name=\"Wilber\">{{cite web | title=Wilbur & Wilma Wildcat | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=Traditions Tour | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214175921/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archivedate = February 14, 2006}}</ref> Arizona's first mascot was a real desert [[bobcat]] named \"Rufus Arizona\", introduced in 1915.<ref name=\"History 10\">{{cite web | title=Rufus Arizona | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060226193333/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 26, 2006}}</ref>\n\nWilbur was originally created by Bob White as a cartoon character in the university's humor magazine, ''Kitty Kat''. From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Wildcat Family Statue, University of Arizona.jpg|thumb|upright|Wildcat Family Statue]]\n\n===Fraternities and sororities===\nThe University of Arizona recognizes 51 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greek.arizona.edu/|title=UA Fraternity & Sorority Programs|author=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 2, 2019|df=}}</ref> {{as of|2018||df=|lc=|since=}}, more than 16% of students are part of UA's 52-chapter Greek life program.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008. It focuses on pursuing institutionalized sustainability throughout the University of Arizona and the greater Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Students for Sustainability|access-date=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313004014/http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)====\nIn 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the ''de facto'' body representing graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.\n\n====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====\nOn-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body and the 24 individual hall councils.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of nine student leaders that help run the organization. The positions are as follow: President, National Communications Coordinator, the Directors of Business Administration, Operations, Programming, Marketing and Equipment Services, the RHA parliamentarian, the Executive Director of the National Residence Hall Honorary and an advisor. The RHA Executive Board is elected to one-year terms during the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uarha.com/contact |title=Contact Us |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |publisher=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe General Body is composed of representatives from each of the 24 residence halls on campus, the executive board and liaisons from ASUA, Advocates Coming Together and Eco-Reps. At general body meetings issues regarding the residence halls and their 6,000 plus inhabitants are discussed and decided upon.\n\nFinally, each of the 24 residence halls on campus have their own councils which provide a variety of services and programming opportunities for residents. Each of these councils must include the following: one sustainability representative, one social justice advocate and two RHA representatives that represent their hall at the general meetings. Hall council members elected by the residents of their respective residence halls during the first two weeks of the fall semester and serve terms running through the end of the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://housing.arizona.edu/life-on-campus/get-involved |title=Get Involved: Residence Hall Involvement |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Housing and Residential Life |publisher=University of Arizona |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Regional and national involvement =====\n\nThe University of Arizona Residence Hall Association has hosted three regional IACURH Residence Hall Conferences, which were hosted in 1961, 1997, and 2004 and a \"no frills\" business meeting in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofrills.arizona.edu|title=Home|accessdate=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113130111/http://nofrills.arizona.edu/|archive-date=January 13, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2005 and 2012 the University of Arizona's Residence Hall Association was voted by [[NACURH]] (National Association of College and University Residence Halls) as the National School of the Year out of over 400 schools across the United States.

Scrooge is an elderly Scottish [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[American Pekin duck|Pekin duck]] with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a red or blue [[frock coat]], [[top hat]], [[pince-nez]] glasses, and [[Spat (footwear)|spats]]. He is portrayed in animations as speaking with a [[Scottish accent]].\n\nNamed after [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] from the 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Scrooge is an incredibly wealthy [[business magnate]] and self-proclaimed \"adventure-capitalist\" whose dominant character traits are his wealth, his [[frugality|thrift]], and his tendency to seek more wealth through adventure. He is the maternal uncle of [[Donald Duck]], the [[grand-uncle]] of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], and a usual financial backer of [[Gyro Gearloose]]. Within the context of the fictional [[Donald Duck universe|Duck universe]], he is the world's richest person.<ref>{{Citation|last=The Film Theorists|title=Film Theory: Scrooge McDuck's Net Worth SOLVED! (Disney's DuckTales)|date=2017-08-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-hQf-F3hyU|accessdate=2017-08-19}}</ref> He is portrayed as an oil tycoon, businessman, industrialist, and owner of the largest mining concerns and many factories to operate different activities. His \"Money Bin\" \u2014 and indeed Scrooge himself \u2014 are often used as a humorous [[metonym]]s for great wealth in popular culture around the world.\n\nMcDuck was initially characterized as a greedy [[miser]] and [[antihero]] (as [[Charles Dickens]]' original Scrooge was), but in later appearances he has often been portrayed as a thrifty [[hero]], adventurer and explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an [[antagonist]] for [[Donald Duck]], first appearing in the 1947 ''[[Disney comics#Four Color|Four Color]]'' story ''[[Christmas on Bear Mountain]]'' (#178). However, McDuck's popularity grew so large that he became a major figure of the [[Duck universe]]. In 1952 he was given his own comic book series, called ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'', which still runs today.\n\nScrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks, and later by [[Don Rosa]]. Like other Disney franchise characters, Scrooge McDuck's international popularity has resulted in literature that is often translated into other languages. Comics have remained Scrooge's primary medium, although he has also appeared in [[animated cartoon]]s, most extensively in the television series ''[[DuckTales]]'' (1987\u20131990) and its [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|reboot]] (2017-) as the main protagonist of both series.\n\n==Comics history==\n===First appearance===\n{{details|Christmas on Bear Mountain}}\n[[File:ScroogeFirst.jpg|right|frame|One of Scrooge's first panels in ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'']]\n\nScrooge McDuck, maternal uncle of previously established character [[Donald Duck]], made his first named appearance in the story ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'' which was published in Dell's ''Four Color Comics'' #178, December 1947, written and drawn by artist [[Carl Barks]]. His appearance may have been based on a similar-looking, Scottish \"thrifty saver\" Donald Duck character from the 1943 propaganda short ''[[The Spirit of '43]]''.<ref>[[David Gerstein|Gerstein, David]], \"[http://nafsk.se/pipermail/dcml/2003-April/016580.html 1st Scrooge McDuck in 1943??]\", Retrieved on October 9, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'',<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++178-02|Title= Christmas on Bear Mountain}}</ref> Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, reasonably wealthy old duck, visibly leaning on his cane, and living in isolation in a \"huge mansion\".<ref name=\"bearmountain\">[[Carl Barks|Barks, Carl]] (writer and illustrator). \"[[Christmas on Bear Mountain]]\".

Retrieved on September 5, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Recurring character===\nBarks would later claim that he originally only intended to use Scrooge as a one-shot character, but then decided Scrooge (and his fortune) could prove useful for motivating further stories. Barks continued to experiment with Scrooge's appearance and personality over the next four years.\n\nScrooge's second appearance, in ''[[The Old Castle's Secret]]''<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++189-02|Title=The Old Castle's Secret}}</ref> (first published in June 1948), had Scrooge recruiting his nephews to search for a family treasure hidden in Dismal Downs, the McDuck family's ancestral castle, built in the middle of [[Rannoch Moor]] in Scotland. ''[[Foxy Relations]]'' (first published in November 1948) was the first story where Scrooge is called by his title and [[catchphrase]] \"The Richest Duck in the World\".\n\n[[File:ScroogeMcDuck Comic.jpg|frame|right|A panel from an Uncle Scrooge comic by [[Jack Bradbury]]]]\n\n===First hints of Scrooge's past===\nThe story, ''[[Voodoo Hoodoo]]'', first published in Dell's ''Four Color Comics'' #238, August 1949, was the first story to hint at Scrooge's past with the introduction of two figures from it. The first was Foola Zoola, an old African sorcerer and chief of the [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] tribe who had cursed Scrooge, seeking revenge for the destruction of his village and the taking of his tribe's lands by Scrooge decades ago.\n\nScrooge privately admitted to his nephews that he had used an army of \"cutthroats\" to get the tribe to abandon their lands, in order to establish a [[Rubber#Cultivation|rubber plantation]]. The event was placed by Carl Barks in 1879 during the story, but it would later be [[retcon]]ned by Don Rosa to 1909 to fit with Scrooge's later-established personal history. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe second figure was [[Bombie the Zombie]], the organ of the sorcerer's curse and revenge. He had reportedly sought Scrooge for decades before reaching Duckburg, mistaking Donald for Scrooge.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nBarks, with a note of [[skepticism]] often found in his stories, explained the zombie as a living person who has never died, but has somehow gotten under the influence of a sorcerer. Although some scenes of the story were intended as a [[parody]] of [[Bela Lugosi]]'s ''[[White Zombie (movie)|White Zombie]]'', the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge's past but also touch on the darkest aspects of his personality.\n\n===Later stories===\n''[[Trail of the Unicorn]]'',<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++263-03|Title=Trail of the Unicorn}}</ref> first published in February 1950, introduced Scrooge's private [[zoo]]. One of his pilots had managed to photograph the last living [[unicorn]], which lived in the Indian part of the [[Himalayas]]. Scrooge offered a reward to competing cousins Donald Duck and [[Gladstone Gander]], which would go to the one who captured the unicorn for Scrooge's collection of animals.\n\nThis was also the story that introduced Scrooge's private airplane. Barks would later establish Scrooge as an experienced aviator. Donald had previously been shown as a skilled aviator, as was [[Flintheart Glomgold]] in later stories. In comparison, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] were depicted as only having taken flying lessons in the story ''[[Frozen Gold]]'' (published in January 1945).\n\n''[[The Pixilated Parrot]]'', first published in July 1950, introduced the precursor to Scrooge's money bin; in this story, Scrooge's central office building is said to contain \"three [[Cube (arithmetic)|cubic]] acres of money\". Two nameless burglars who briefly appear during the story are considered to be the precursors of the [[Beagle Boys]].<ref>[[Thomas Andrae|Andrae, Thomas]] Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity. Jackson, Miss: Univ. Press Mississippi, 2006. Print.</ref>\n\n===Scrooge as a major character===\n''[[The Magic Hourglass]]'', first published in September 1950, was arguably the first story to change the focus of the Duck stories from Donald to Scrooge. During the story, several themes were introduced for Scrooge.\n\nDonald first mentions in this story that his uncle practically owns Duckburg, a statement that Scrooge's rival [[John D. Rockerduck]] would later put in dispute. Scrooge first hints that he was not born into wealth, as he remembers buying the Hourglass in [[Morocco]] when he was a member of a ship's crew as a cabin boy. It is also the first story in which Scrooge mentions speaking another language besides his native English and reading other alphabets besides the [[Latin alphabet]], as during the story, he speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and reads the [[Arabic alphabet]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe latter theme would be developed further in later stories. Barks and current Scrooge writer [[Don Rosa]] have depicted Scrooge as being fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], German, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], Spanish, [[Maya language|Mayan]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]]. Scrooge acquired this knowledge from years of living or traveling to the various regions of the world where those languages are spoken. Later writers would depict Scrooge having at least working knowledge of several other languages.\n\nScrooge was shown in ''The Magic Hourglass'' in a more positive light than in previous stories, but his more villainous side is present too. Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic [[hourglass]] that he gave to Donald, before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him. Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute, and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years. This line is a parody of [[Orson Welles]]'s line in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' \"You know, Mr.&nbsp;Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in ... 60 years\".<ref>See [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/quotes Citizen Kane quotes] from the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> To convince his nephews to return it, he pursues them throughout Morocco, where they had headed to earlier in the story. Memorably during the story, Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass's location. Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it, exchanging it for a flask of water, as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies. As Scrooge explains, he intended to give them a higher offer, but he just could not resist having somebody at his mercy without taking advantage of it.\n\n===Final developments===\n''[[A Financial Fable]]'', first published in March 1951, had Scrooge teaching Donald some lessons in productivity as the source of wealth, along with the laws of [[supply and demand]]. Perhaps more importantly, it was also the first story where Scrooge observes how diligent and industrious Huey, Louie and Dewey are, making them more similar to himself rather than to Donald. Donald in Barks's stories is depicted as working hard on occasion, but given the choice often proves to be a shirker. The three younger nephews first side with Scrooge rather than Donald in this story, with the bond between granduncle and grandnephews strengthening in later stories. However, there have been rare instances where Donald proved invaluable to Scrooge, such as when the group traveled back in time to Ancient Egypt to retrieve a pharaoh's [[papyrus]]. Donald cautions against taking it with him, as no one would believe the story unless it was unearthed. Donald then buries it and makes a marking point from the [[Nile River]], making Scrooge think to himself admiringly, \"Donald must have swallowed the {{Sic|[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|hide=yes}}!\"\n\n''[[Terror of the Beagle Boys]]'', first published in November 1951, introduced the readers to the Beagle Boys, although Scrooge in this story seems to be already familiar with them. ''[[The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill]]'' introduced Scrooge's [[money bin]], built on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg.\n\nBy this point, Scrooge had become familiar to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney writers and artists besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories, including Italian writer [[Romano Scarpa]]. [[Western Publishing]], the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. ''Uncle Scrooge'' #1, featuring the story ''[[Only a Poor Old Man]]'', was published in March 1952. This story along with ''[[Back to the Klondike]]'', first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined.\n\nAfter this point, Barks produced most of his longer stories in ''Uncle Scrooge'', with a focus mainly on adventure, while his ten-page stories for [[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]] continued to feature Donald as the star and focused on comedy. In Scrooge's stories, Donald and his nephews were cast as Scrooge's assistants, who accompanied Scrooge in his adventures around the world. This change of focus from Donald to Scrooge was also reflected in stories by other contemporary writers. Since then, Scrooge remains a central figure of the Duck comics' universe, thus the coining of the term \"[[Scrooge McDuck Universe]]\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Modern era===\nAfter Barks's retirement, the character continued under other artists. In 1972, Barks was persuaded to write more stories for Disney. He wrote [[Junior Woodchuck]] stories where Scrooge often plays the part of the villain, closer to the role he had before he acquired his own series. Under Barks, Scrooge always was a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot.\n\nThe Italian writer and artist [[Romano Scarpa]] made several additions to Scrooge McDuck's universe, including characters such as [[Brigitta McBridge]], Scrooge's self-styled fianc\u00e9e, and [[Gideon McDuck]], a newspaper editor who is Scrooge's brother. Those characters have appeared mostly in European comics. So is also the case for Scrooge's rival [[John D. Rockerduck]] (created by Barks for just one story) and Donald's cousin [[Fethry Duck]], who sometimes works as a reporter for Scrooge's newspaper.\n\nAnother major development was the arrival of writer and artist [[Don Rosa]] in 1986 with his story \"[[The Son of the Sun]]\", released by [[Gladstone Publishing]] and nominated for a [[Harvey Award]], one of the comics industry's highest honors. Rosa has said in interviews that he considers Scrooge to be his favorite Disney character. Unlike most other Disney writers, Don Rosa considered Scrooge as a historical character whose Disney adventures had occurred in the fifties and sixties and ended (in his undepicted death<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=GC+HD++77B|Title=Don Rosa's artwork}}</ref>) in 1967 when Barks retired. He considered only Barks' stories canonical, and fleshed out a timeline as well as a family tree based on Barks' stories. Eventually he wrote and drew ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', a full history in twelve chapters which received an [[Eisner Award]] in 1995. Later editions included additional chapters. Under Rosa, Scrooge became more ethical; while he never cheats, he ruthlessly exploits any loopholes. He owes his fortune to his hard work and his money bin is \"full of souvenirs\" since every coin reminds him of a specific circumstance. Rosa remains the foremost contemporary duck artist and has been nominated for five 2007 Eisner Awards. His work is regularly reprinted by itself as well as along with Barks stories for which he created a sequel.\n\n[[Daan Jippes]], who can mimic Barks's art to a close extent, repenciled all of Barks's 1970s Junior Woodchucks stories, as well as Barks' final Uncle Scrooge stories, from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Other notable Disney artists who have worked with the Scrooge character include [[Michael Peraza]], [[Marco Rota]], [[William Van Horn]], and [[Tony Strobl]].\n\nIn an interview with the Norwegian \"Aftenposten\" from 1992 Don Rosa says that \"in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge\" and he also says that this is one of the reasons why he is so interested in Scrooge.\n\n==Characterization==\n===Wealth===\n[[File:Scroogeswim.jpg|left|thumb|Scrooge's signature dive into money]]\nThe character is almost exclusively portrayed as having worked his way up the financial ladder from humble immigrant roots.  The real life of [[Andrew Carnegie]], a Scottish-American immigrant and tycoon of the Industrial Age, and the fictional character of [[Charles Dickens]]' miser [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] are both believed to be strong influences on Scrooge's characterization.\n\nThe comic book series ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', written and drawn by [[Don Rosa]], shows Scrooge as a young boy, he took up a job polishing and shining boots in his native [[Glasgow]]. A pivotal moment comes in 1877, when a ditchdigger pays him with an [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|1875 US dime]], which was useless as currency in 19th century Glasgow; he fails to notice what sort of coin he's been given until after the man has left. Enraged, Scrooge vowed to never be taken advantage of again, to be \"sharper than the sharpies and smarter than the smarties.\" He takes a position as cabin boy on a Clyde cattle ship to the United States to make his fortune at the age of 13. In 1898, after many adventures he finally ends up in Klondike, where he finds a golden rock the size of a goose's egg. By the following year he had made his first $1,000,000 and bought the deed for Killmule Hill from Casey Coot, the son of Clinton Coot and grandson of Cornelius Coot, the founder of Duckburg. He finally ends up in Duckburg in 1902. After some dramatic events where he faces both the Beagle Boys and president Roosevelt and his \"[[Rough Riders]]\" at the same time, he tears down the rest of the old fort Duckburg and builds his famous Money Bin at the site.\n\nIn the years to follow, Scrooge travels all around the world in order to increase his fortune, while his family remained behind to manage the Money Bin. When Scrooge finally returns to Duckburg, he is the richest [[duck]] in the world, rivaled only by [[Flintheart Glomgold]], [[John D. Rockerduck]], and less prominently, the [[maharaja]] of the [[fictional country]] Howdoyoustan (play on [[Hindustan]]). His experiences, however, had changed him into a hostile miser, and he made his own family leave.{{elucidate|date=August 2015}} Some 12 years later, he closed his empire down, but eventually returned to a public life five years later and started his business.\n\nHe keeps the majority of his wealth in a massive Money Bin overlooking the city of Duckburg. In the short ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'', he remarks to his nephews that this money is \"just [[petty cash]]\". In the Dutch and Italian version he regularly forces Donald and his nephews to polish the coins one by one in order to pay off Donald's debts; Scrooge will not pay them much for this lengthy, tedious, hand-breaking work. As far as he is concerned, even 5 cents an hour is too much expenditure.\n\nA shrewd businessman and noted tightwad, he is fond of diving into and swimming in his money, without injury. He is also the richest member of The Billionaires Club of Duckburg, a society which includes the most successful businessmen of the world and allows them to keep connections with each other. Glomgold and Rockerduck are also influential members of the Club. His most famous prized possession is his [[Number One Dime]].\n\n[[File:Scroogemoney.jpg|right|thumb|Valuation of Scrooge assets in Barks' ''The Second Richest Duck'']]\nThe sum of Scrooge's wealth is unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbarks.dk/theserieswealth.htm|title=theserieswealth|website=cbarks.dk}}</ref> According to Barks' ''The Second Richest Duck'' as noted by a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article, Scrooge is worth \"one multiplujillion, nine obsquatumatillion, six hundred twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921233,00.html | title=The Duck with the Bucks |last= Cocks| first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Cocks |date=May 17, 1982 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> In the ''DuckTales'' episode \"Liquid Assets\", [[Fenton Crackshell]] (Scrooge's accountant) notes that McDuck's money bin contains \"607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents\". Don Rosa's ''Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'' notes that Scrooge amounts to \"five multiplujillion, nine impossibidillion, seven fantastica trillion dollars and sixteen cents\". A thought bubble from Scrooge McDuck sitting in his car with his chauffeur in ''Walt Disney's Christmas Parade'' No.1 (published in 1949) that takes place in the story \"Letter to Santa\" clearly states \"What's the use of having 'eleven octillion dollars' if I don't make a big noise about it?\" In ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'', Scrooge mentions \"We quadzillionaires have our own ideas of fun.\" In the first episode of the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 DuckTales series]], Scrooge states that he runs \"a multi-trillion dollar business\".\n\n''[[Forbes]]'' magazine has occasionally tried to estimate Scrooge's wealth in real terms; in 2007, the magazine estimated his wealth at $28.8 billion;<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/11/richest-fictional-characters-oped-books-fict1507-cx_mn_de_1211fictional15_land.html | title=The Forbes Fictional 15 |author=Noer, Michael (ed.) |author2=Ewalt, David M.

A [[running gag]] is Scrooge always making profit on any business deal.<ref>[Walt Disney \"Golden Key\" Comics Digest #January 19, 1970 \"Much Luck McDuck\"]</ref>\n\n===Education===\nScrooge never completed a formal education, as he left school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge has become something of a scholar and an amateur [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.\n\nAs a result of his research, Scrooge has built up an extensive personal library, which includes many rare tomes. In Barks's and Rosa's stories, among the prized pieces of this library is an almost complete collection of Spanish and Dutch naval logs of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their references to the fates of other ships have often allowed Scrooge to locate sunken ships and recover their treasures from their watery graves. Mostly self-taught as he is, Scrooge is a firm believer in the saying \"knowledge is power\". Scrooge is also an accomplished [[linguist]] and entrepreneur, having learned to speak several different languages during his business trips around the world, selling refrigerators to [[Eskimo]]s, wind to windmill manufacturers in the [[Netherlands]], etc.\n\n===Morality and beliefs===\nBoth as a businessman and as a treasure hunter, Scrooge is noted for his drive to set new goals and face new challenges.<ref>[https://mises.org/wire/christmas-lets-celebrate-different-scrooge-scrooge-mcduck This Christmas, Let's Celebrate a Different Scrooge: Scrooge McDuck], [[Mises Institute]]</ref> As Carl Barks described his character, for Scrooge there is \"always another rainbow\". The phrase later provided the title for one of Barks's better-known paintings depicting Scrooge. Periods of inactivity between adventures and lack of serious challenges tend to be depressing for Scrooge after a while; some stories see these phases take a toll on his health. Scrooge's other motto is \"Work smarter, not harder.\"\n\nAs a businessman, Scrooge often resorts to aggressive tactics and deception. He seems to have gained significant experience in manipulating people and events towards his own ends. As often seen in stories by writer [[Guido Martina]] and occasionally by others, Scrooge is noted for his [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], especially towards ideals of [[morality]] when it comes to business and the pursuit of set goals. This has been noted by some as not being part of Barks's original profile of the character, but has since come to be accepted as one valid interpretation of Scrooge's way of thinking.\n\nScrooge seems to have a personal code of honesty that offers him an amount of self-control. He can often be seen contemplating the next course of action, divided between adopting a ruthless pursuit of his current goal against those tactics he considers more honest. At times, he can sacrifice his goal in order to remain within the limits of this sense of honesty. Several fans of the character have come to consider these depictions as adding to the depth of his personality, because based on the decisions he takes Scrooge can be both the [[hero]] and the [[villain]] of his stories. This is one thing he has in common with his nephew [[Donald Duck|Donald]]. Scrooge's sense of honesty also distinguishes him from his rival [[Flintheart Glomgold]], who places no such self-limitations. During the cartoon series ''DuckTales'', at times he would be heard saying to Glomgold, \"You're a cheater, and cheaters ''never'' prosper!\"\n\nLike his nephew Donald, Scrooge has also a temper (but not as a strong temper as his nephew) and rarely hesitates to use cartoon violence against those who provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, he seems to be against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in [[fairy tale]]s do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word\u2014never breaking a promise once given.<ref>An example is when Scrooge, his family and the Beagle Boys are trapped in the past. Hatching a plan to return to their normal time, he is told they could easily leave the Beagles stranded in the past; Scrooge refuses, noting that he gave his word everyone would return safely.</ref> In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.\n\nCarl Barks gave Scrooge a definite set of ethics which were in tone with the time he was supposed to have made his fortune. The [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]] and industrialists of the 1890\u20131920s era were McDuck's competition as he earned his fortune. Scrooge proudly asserts \"I made it by being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties! And I made it square!\" Barks's creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth. When Disney filmmakers first contemplated a Scrooge feature cartoon in the fifties, the animators had no understanding of the Scrooge McDuck character and merely envisioned Scrooge as a duck version of Ebenezer Scrooge\u2014a very unsympathetic character. In the end they shelved the idea because a duck who gets all excited about money just was not funny enough.\n\nIn an interview, Barks summed up his beliefs about Scrooge and [[capitalism]]:\n\n{{quote|I've always looked at the ducks as caricatured human beings. In rereading the stories, I realized that I had gotten kind of deep in some of them: there was philosophy in there that I hadn't realized I was putting in. It was an added feature that went along with the stories. I think a lot of the philosophy in my stories is [[Traditionalist conservatism|conservative]]\u2014conservative in the sense that I feel our civilization peaked around 1910. Since then we've been going downhill. Much of the older culture had basic qualities that the new stuff we keep hatching can never match.\n\nLook at the magnificent cathedrals and palaces that were built. Nobody can build that sort of thing nowadays. Also, I believe that we should preserve many old ideals and methods of working: honor, honesty, allowing other people to believe in their own ideas, not trying to force everyone into one form. The thing I have against the present political system is that it tries to make everybody exactly alike. We should have a million different patterns.\n\nThey say that wealthy people like the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers are sinful because they accumulated fortunes by exploiting the poor. I feel that everybody should be able to rise as high as they can or want to, provided they don't kill anybody or actually oppress other people on the way up. A little exploitation is something you come by in nature. We see it in the pecking order of animals\u2014everybody has to be exploited or to exploit someone else to a certain extent. I don't resent those things.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barks|first=Carl|title=Carl Barks: Conversations|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-501-1}}</ref>}}\n\n===''DuckTales''===\n[[File:ScroogeWithNephews.jpg|thumb|left|Scrooge stars alongside his great-nephews in ''[[DuckTales]]'']]\nIn the ''[[DuckTales]]'' series, Scrooge has adopted the nephews (as Donald has joined the Navy and is away on his tour of duty), and as a result his darker personality traits are downplayed. While most of his persona remain from the comics, he is notably more [[Optimism|optimistic]] and less irritable in the animated cartoon. In an early episode, Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby (his housekeeper's granddaughter, who comes to live in Scrooge's mansion), saying that \"for the first time since I left [[Scotland]], I have a family\". Though Scrooge is far from tyrannical in the comics, he is rarely so openly affectionate. While he still hunts for treasure in ''DuckTales'', many episodes focus on his attempts to thwart villains. However, he remains just as tightfisted with money as he has always been. But he's also affable and patient with his family and friends.\n\nScrooge displays a strict code of honor, insisting that the only valid way to acquire [[wealth]] is to \"earn it square,\" and he goes to great lengths to thwart those (sometimes even his own nephews) who gain money dishonestly. This code also prevents him from ever being dishonest himself, and he avows that \"Scrooge McDuck's word is as good as gold.\" He also expresses great disgust at being viewed by others as a greedy liar and cheater.\n\nThe series fleshes out Scrooge's upbringing by depicting his life as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest but also, he defends his family and friends from any dangers, including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer the most important thing in his life. For one episode, he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.\n\nOn occasion, he demonstrates considerable physical strength by single-handedly beating bigger foes. He credits his robustness to \"lifting money bags.\"\n\n===Voice===\nAnother part of Scrooge's persona is his Scottish accent. [[Dallas McKennon]] was the first actor to provide Scrooge's voice for the 1960 [[Disneyland Records]] album, ''Donald Duck and His Friends''.\n\nWhen Scrooge later made his animated debut in ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'' in 1967, he was voiced by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]]. Thompson had previously voiced Jock the [[Scottish Terrier]] in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' and, according to [[Alan Young]], Thompson had some Scottish ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicshowbiz.blogspot.com/2010/12/interview-with-alan-young.html|title=An Interview with Alan Young|date=December 4, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Following ''Scrooge McDuck and Money'''s release, Scrooge made no further animated appearances prior to Thompson's death in 1971.\n\nIn 1974, Disneyland Records produced the album, ''An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players''. Alan Young belonged to a Dickens Society and was asked to help adapt the story to fit in the classic Disney characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mydailyfind.com/2009/12/01/mister-eds-alan-young-talks-about-the-talking-horse-and-hollywood-lore/|title=Mister Ed's Alan Young about the talking horse and Hollywood lore|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Young, whose parents were Scottish and who lived in Scotland for a few years when he was an infant,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://colemanzone.com/Time_Machine_Project/filby.htm|title=Interview with Alan Young|date=October 19, 1999|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> voiced Scrooge for this record in addition to voicing [[Mickey Mouse]] and Merlin from ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. When Disney decided to adapt the record into the 1983 theatrical short, ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', Young returned to voice Scrooge. Young remained as Disney's official voice for Scrooge until his death in 2016, although [[Will Ryan]] voiced Scrooge for the 1987 television special, ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' and [[Alan Reid (musician)|Alan Reid]] voiced Scrooge for [[Tuomas Holopainen]]'s 2014 album, ''[[Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge]]''. Young's last performance as Scrooge was in the 2016 ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short, \"No\".\n\nSince Young's death, several actors have provided Scrooge's voice. [[John Kassir]] has voiced Scrooge for the ''Mickey Mouse'' shorts starting with \"Duck the Halls\" in 2016. [[Eric Bauza]] voiced Scrooge for a cameo in the television series, ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. Scottish actor [[Enn Reitel]] voices Scrooge for Disney park appearances as well as in the English dub of ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n\n[[David Tennant]] voices Scrooge for the 2017 reboot of ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]''. According to executive producer Matt Youngberg:\n\n{{quote|David Tennant seemed to be the natural choice for this. We really wanted to find somebody who was legitimately Scottish. We thought that was really important in this iteration, someone who had the character to bring this icon alive. And David is an amazing actor. He\u2019s morphed into this role in an incredible way.}}\n\n===Europe===\nMany of the European comics based on the Disney Universe have created their own version of Scrooge McDuck, usually involving him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s\u20131980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or [[blunderbuss]], or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings up at the end of the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb \u2013 something which Scrooge shows little concern for \u2013 he tends to end up with nothing.\n\nAnother running joke is Scrooge reminiscing about his adventures while [[gold prospecting]] in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] much to Donald and the nephews' chagrin at hearing the never-ending and tiresome stories.\n\n===Age===\nAccording to Carl Barks' 1955 one-pager \"Watt an Occasion\" (''Uncle Scrooge'' #12), Scrooge is 75 years of age. According to Don Rosa, Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, and earned his Number One Dime (or First Coin) exactly ten years later. The ''DuckTales'' episodes (and many European comics) show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th century, yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s. Despite this extremely advanced age, Scrooge does not appear to be on the verge of dotage, and is vigorous enough to keep up with his nephews in adventures; with rare exception, there appears to be no sign of him slowing down.\n\nBarks responded to some fan letters asking about Scrooge's Adamic age, that in the story \"That's No Fable!\", when Scrooge drank water from a [[Fountain of Youth]] for several days, rather than making him young again (bodily contact with the water was required for that), ingesting the water rejuvenated his body and cured him of his [[rheumatism|rheumatia]], which arguably allowed Scrooge to live beyond his expected years with no sign of slowdown or senility. Don Rosa's solution to the issue of Scrooge's age is that he set all of his stories in the 1950s or earlier, which was when he himself discovered and reveled in Barks' stories as a kid, and in his unofficial timelines, he had Scrooge die in 1967, at the age of 100 years.<ref>https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~starback/dcml/creators/rosa-on-himself.html#dates</ref><ref>https://inducks.org/s.php?c=GC+HD++77B</ref>\n\nIn the 15th episode of the 2017 ''DuckTales'' reboot, \"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\", it is revealed that Scrooge was \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\" called Demogorgana for an unknown amount of time, which is used to explain his young look.<ref>\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\"</ref> In the 19th episode, \"The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!\", Webby Vanderquack's research on Scrooge reveals that he was born in 1867.<ref>\"The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!\"</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Cultural impact===\n''[[Forbes]]'' magazine routinely lists Scrooge McDuck on its annual \"[[Forbes Fictional 15|Fictional 15]]\" list of the richest fictional characters by net worth:\n{|\n|- valign =\"top\"\n|\n* 2002: #4 with $8.2 billion<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/09/13/400fictional_5.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2002 |last= Noer | first=Michael; and Dan Ackman|date=September 13, 2002 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2005: #6 with $8.2 billion<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/fictional/06.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2005 |last= Herper | first=Matthew|date=November 20, 2005 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2006: #3 with $10.9 billion<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/scrooge-mcduck-money-tech-media_cx_mn_06fict15_duck.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2006 |last= Noer| first=Michael|date=November 20, 2006 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2007: #1 with $28.8 billion ([[Pound sterling|\u20a4]]17.6 billion)<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/11/scrooge-mcduck-money-oped-books-cx_mh_fict1507_1211scrooge.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2007 | last=Herper | first=Matthew |date=December 11, 2007 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n|\n* 2008: #2 with $29.1 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/18/scrooge-mcduck-money-oped-fictional1508-cx_de_1218scrooge.html | work=Forbes | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | title=No. 2 McDuck, Scrooge | date=December 18, 2008}}</ref>\n* 2010: #2 with $33.5 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/13/scrooge-mcduck-bio-opinions-fictional-15-10-scrooge.html | work=Forbes | first=Matthew | last=Herper | title=No. 2 McDuck, Scrooge | date=April 14, 2010}}</ref>\n* 2011: #1 with $44.1 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/fictional15/2011/profile/scrooge-mcduck.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2011 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2013: #1 with $65.4 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlg45edmmd/1-scrooge-mcduck/ | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2013 | work=Forbes | first=David M. | last=Ewalt}}</ref>\n|}\n\nGrupo Ronda S.A has the license to use the character, as well as other Disney characters in the board game ''T\u00edo Rico Mc.

Most notably, Scrooge has met US president [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt and Scrooge would meet each other at least three times: in the Dakotas in 1883, in Duckburg in 1902, and in Panama in 1906.

Scrooge's voice was first heard on the 1960 record album ''Donald Duck and His Friends;'' [[Dal McKennon]] voiced the character for this appearance. It took the form of a short dramatization called \"Uncle Scrooge's Rocket to the Moon,\" a story of how Scrooge builds a rocket to send all his money to the moon to protect it from the Beagle Boys.<ref name=\"cartoonresearch1\">{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mickeys-christmas-carol/|title=\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" -|website=cartoonresearch.com}}</ref> In 1961 this story was reissued as a 45rpm single record entitled \"Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge's Money Rocket.\"\n\nInitially, Scrooge was to make his animated debut in the Donald Duck theatrical cartoons. Late in 1954, Carl Barks was asked by the Disney Studios if he would be free to write a script for a Scrooge McDuck 7-minute animated cartoon.<ref>http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonapproach.htm</ref> Scrooge was a huge success in the comic books at the time, and Disney now wanted to introduce the miserly duck to theater audiences as well. Barks supplied the studios with a detailed 9-page script, telling the story of the happy-go-lucky Donald Duck working for the troubled Scrooge who tries to save his money from a hungry rat.<ref>http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonsynopsis.htm</ref> Barks also sent number of sketches of his ideas for the short, including a money-sorting machine, which Barks had already used on the cover of one of the Uncle Scrooge issues.<ref>http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonsketches.htm</ref> The script was never used as Disney soon after decided to concentrate on TV shows instead.\n\nScrooge's first appearance in animated form (save for a brief ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' television series cameo) was in Disney's 1967 theatrical short ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'' (voiced by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]]), in which he teaches his nephews basic financial tips.<ref>Berg, Bill (writer) & Hamilton, Luske (director). ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'', [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]. March 23, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[Disneyland Records]] released an adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] classic ''[[A Christmas Carol]] ''. Eight years later, the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] decided to make a [[featurette]] of this same story, this time dubbed ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983). He also appeared as himself in the television special ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' (1987).\n\nScrooge's biggest role outside comics would come in the 1987 [[animated series]] ''[[DuckTales]]'', a series loosely based on Carl Barks's comics, and where [[Alan Young]] returned to voice him. In this series, premiered over two-hours on September 18, 1987, while the regular episodes began three days later, Scrooge becomes the legal guardian of Huey, Dewey and Louie when Donald joins the [[United States Navy]]. Scrooge's ''DuckTales'' persona is considerably mellow compared to most previous appearances; his aggression is played down and his often duplicitous personality is reduced in many episodes to that of a curmudgeonly but well-meaning old uncle. Still, there are flashes of Barks' Scrooge to be seen, particularly in early episodes of the first season. Scrooge also appeared in ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'', released during the series' run. He was mentioned in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode \"Tiff of the Titans\", but never really seen.<!--seen or not?-->\n\nHe has appeared in some episodes of ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', two shorts of ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and some episodes (specially \"House of Scrooge\") of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', as well as the [[direct-to-video]] films ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''. His video game appearances include the three ''DuckTales'' releases (''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'', ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: The Quest for Gold]]''), and in ''[[Toontown Online]]'' as the accidental creator of the Cogs. Additionally, he is a secret playable character in 2008 quiz game, ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''. In the 2012 [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', he is one of the first characters Mickey rescues, running a shop in the fortress selling upgrades and serving as a Sketch summon in which he uses his cane pogostick from the Ducktales NES games.\n\n[[File:Scrooge in KH2.jpg|thumb|Scrooge in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'']]\nScrooge also makes sporadic appearances in Disney's and [[Square Enix]]'s ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, helping Mickey Mouse establish a world transit system to expand his business empire to other worlds.

He works on establishing an ice-cream business in Radiant Garden and gives Ventus three passes to the Dream Festival in Disney Town. Scrooge returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', now managing a bistro in Twilight Town with the help of Remy from ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. Alan Young reprises the role in the English version of ''Birth by Sleep'', while [[Enn Reitel]] voices the character in ''III''.\n\nScrooge has appeared in the [[Boom! Studios]] ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' comic, playing a key role at the end of its initial story, \"The Duck Knight Returns\". Later he would also play a key role on the final story arc \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\", where he teams up with Darkwing Duck in order to stop the [[Phantom Blot]] and [[Magica De Spell]] from taking over St. Canard and Duckburg.\n\nIn 2015, Scrooge was seen in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short \"Goofy's First Love\", where Mickey and Donald are trying to help Goofy find his love. Donald suggests money, and they head over to Scrooge's mansion where Donald tells his uncle that Goofy needs a million dollars. Scrooge then has his butler kick them out. When Goofy is inadvertently launched from a treadmill and catapulted off another building, he lands in Scrooge's mansion. The butler kicks Goofy out and the process repeats itself but this time Mickey and Donald are catapulted as well and kicked out by the butler. Scrooge is seen at the end attending Goofy's wedding with a sandwich. In the 2016 ''Mickey Mouse'' Christmas special, \"Duck the Halls\", after Young's death, [[John Kassir]] took over voicing Scrooge McDuck, however he later [[Twitter|tweeted]] that he won't be reprising his role in the reboot. Kassir continues to voice the character in subsequent appearances in this series. Scrooge makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'' episode \"Shangri-La-Di-Da\".\n\nIn the new ''DuckTales,'' Scrooge is played by Scottish actor [[David Tennant]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2017/03/first-look-david-tennant-voices-scrooge-mcduck-in-ducktales|title=First Look: David Tennant Voices Scrooge McDuck in 'DuckTales' {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}</ref> This series shows that Scrooge previously adventured with his nephew Donald and his niece [[Della Duck]], but when Della disappeared during an expedition to space, Donald blamed Scrooge and the two became estranged for ten years.

Scrooge is an elderly Scottish [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[American Pekin duck|Pekin duck]] with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a red or blue [[frock coat]], [[top hat]], [[pince-nez]] glasses, and [[Spat (footwear)|spats]]. He is portrayed in animations as speaking with a [[Scottish accent]].\n\nNamed after [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] from the 1843 novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Scrooge is an incredibly wealthy [[business magnate]] and self-proclaimed \"adventure-capitalist\" whose dominant character traits are his wealth, his [[frugality|thrift]], and his tendency to seek more wealth through adventure. He is the maternal uncle of [[Donald Duck]], the [[grand-uncle]] of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], and a usual financial backer of [[Gyro Gearloose]]. Within the context of the fictional [[Donald Duck universe|Duck universe]], he is the world's richest person.<ref>{{Citation|last=The Film Theorists|title=Film Theory: Scrooge McDuck's Net Worth SOLVED!

His \"Money Bin\" \u2014 and indeed Scrooge himself \u2014 are often used as a humorous [[metonym]]s for great wealth in popular culture around the world.\n\nMcDuck was initially characterized as a greedy [[miser]] and [[antihero]] (as [[Charles Dickens]]' original Scrooge was), but in later appearances he has often been portrayed as a thrifty [[hero]], adventurer and explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an [[antagonist]] for [[Donald Duck]], first appearing in the 1947 ''[[Disney comics#Four Color|Four Color]]'' story ''[[Christmas on Bear Mountain]]'' (#178). However, McDuck's popularity grew so large that he became a major figure of the [[Duck universe]]. In 1952 he was given his own comic book series, called ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'', which still runs today.\n\nScrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks, and later by [[Don Rosa]]. Like other Disney franchise characters, Scrooge McDuck's international popularity has resulted in literature that is often translated into other languages. Comics have remained Scrooge's primary medium, although he has also appeared in [[animated cartoon]]s, most extensively in the television series ''[[DuckTales]]'' (1987\u20131990) and its [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|reboot]] (2017-) as the main protagonist of both series.\n\n==Comics history==\n===First appearance===\n{{details|Christmas on Bear Mountain}}\n[[File:ScroogeFirst.jpg|right|frame|One of Scrooge's first panels in ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'']]\n\nScrooge McDuck, maternal uncle of previously established character [[Donald Duck]], made his first named appearance in the story ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'' which was published in Dell's ''Four Color Comics'' #178, December 1947, written and drawn by artist [[Carl Barks]].

Retrieved on September 5, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Recurring character===\nBarks would later claim that he originally only intended to use Scrooge as a one-shot character, but then decided Scrooge (and his fortune) could prove useful for motivating further stories. Barks continued to experiment with Scrooge's appearance and personality over the next four years.\n\nScrooge's second appearance, in ''[[The Old Castle's Secret]]''<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++189-02|Title=The Old Castle's Secret}}</ref> (first published in June 1948), had Scrooge recruiting his nephews to search for a family treasure hidden in Dismal Downs, the McDuck family's ancestral castle, built in the middle of [[Rannoch Moor]] in Scotland. ''[[Foxy Relations]]'' (first published in November 1948) was the first story where Scrooge is called by his title and [[catchphrase]] \"The Richest Duck in the World\".\n\n[[File:ScroogeMcDuck Comic.jpg|frame|right|A panel from an Uncle Scrooge comic by [[Jack Bradbury]]]]\n\n===First hints of Scrooge's past===\nThe story, ''[[Voodoo Hoodoo]]'', first published in Dell's ''Four Color Comics'' #238, August 1949, was the first story to hint at Scrooge's past with the introduction of two figures from it. The first was Foola Zoola, an old African sorcerer and chief of the [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] tribe who had cursed Scrooge, seeking revenge for the destruction of his village and the taking of his tribe's lands by Scrooge decades ago.\n\nScrooge privately admitted to his nephews that he had used an army of \"cutthroats\" to get the tribe to abandon their lands, in order to establish a [[Rubber#Cultivation|rubber plantation]]. The event was placed by Carl Barks in 1879 during the story, but it would later be [[retcon]]ned by Don Rosa to 1909 to fit with Scrooge's later-established personal history. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe second figure was [[Bombie the Zombie]], the organ of the sorcerer's curse and revenge. He had reportedly sought Scrooge for decades before reaching Duckburg, mistaking Donald for Scrooge.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nBarks, with a note of [[skepticism]] often found in his stories, explained the zombie as a living person who has never died, but has somehow gotten under the influence of a sorcerer. Although some scenes of the story were intended as a [[parody]] of [[Bela Lugosi]]'s ''[[White Zombie (movie)|White Zombie]]'', the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge's past but also touch on the darkest aspects of his personality.\n\n===Later stories===\n''[[Trail of the Unicorn]]'',<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++263-03|Title=Trail of the Unicorn}}</ref> first published in February 1950, introduced Scrooge's private [[zoo]]. One of his pilots had managed to photograph the last living [[unicorn]], which lived in the Indian part of the [[Himalayas]]. Scrooge offered a reward to competing cousins Donald Duck and [[Gladstone Gander]], which would go to the one who captured the unicorn for Scrooge's collection of animals.\n\nThis was also the story that introduced Scrooge's private airplane. Barks would later establish Scrooge as an experienced aviator. Donald had previously been shown as a skilled aviator, as was [[Flintheart Glomgold]] in later stories. In comparison, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] were depicted as only having taken flying lessons in the story ''[[Frozen Gold]]'' (published in January 1945).\n\n''[[The Pixilated Parrot]]'', first published in July 1950, introduced the precursor to Scrooge's money bin; in this story, Scrooge's central office building is said to contain \"three [[Cube (arithmetic)|cubic]] acres of money\". Two nameless burglars who briefly appear during the story are considered to be the precursors of the [[Beagle Boys]].<ref>[[Thomas Andrae|Andrae, Thomas]] Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity. Jackson, Miss: Univ. Press Mississippi, 2006. Print.</ref>\n\n===Scrooge as a major character===\n''[[The Magic Hourglass]]'', first published in September 1950, was arguably the first story to change the focus of the Duck stories from Donald to Scrooge. During the story, several themes were introduced for Scrooge.\n\nDonald first mentions in this story that his uncle practically owns Duckburg, a statement that Scrooge's rival [[John D. Rockerduck]] would later put in dispute. Scrooge first hints that he was not born into wealth, as he remembers buying the Hourglass in [[Morocco]] when he was a member of a ship's crew as a cabin boy. It is also the first story in which Scrooge mentions speaking another language besides his native English and reading other alphabets besides the [[Latin alphabet]], as during the story, he speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and reads the [[Arabic alphabet]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe latter theme would be developed further in later stories. Barks and current Scrooge writer [[Don Rosa]] have depicted Scrooge as being fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], German, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], Spanish, [[Maya language|Mayan]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]]. Scrooge acquired this knowledge from years of living or traveling to the various regions of the world where those languages are spoken. Later writers would depict Scrooge having at least working knowledge of several other languages.\n\nScrooge was shown in ''The Magic Hourglass'' in a more positive light than in previous stories, but his more villainous side is present too. Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic [[hourglass]] that he gave to Donald, before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him. Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute, and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years. This line is a parody of [[Orson Welles]]'s line in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' \"You know, Mr.&nbsp;Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in ... 60 years\".<ref>See [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/quotes Citizen Kane quotes] from the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> To convince his nephews to return it, he pursues them throughout Morocco, where they had headed to earlier in the story. Memorably during the story, Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass's location. Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it, exchanging it for a flask of water, as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies. As Scrooge explains, he intended to give them a higher offer, but he just could not resist having somebody at his mercy without taking advantage of it.\n\n===Final developments===\n''[[A Financial Fable]]'', first published in March 1951, had Scrooge teaching Donald some lessons in productivity as the source of wealth, along with the laws of [[supply and demand]]. Perhaps more importantly, it was also the first story where Scrooge observes how diligent and industrious Huey, Louie and Dewey are, making them more similar to himself rather than to Donald. Donald in Barks's stories is depicted as working hard on occasion, but given the choice often proves to be a shirker. The three younger nephews first side with Scrooge rather than Donald in this story, with the bond between granduncle and grandnephews strengthening in later stories. However, there have been rare instances where Donald proved invaluable to Scrooge, such as when the group traveled back in time to Ancient Egypt to retrieve a pharaoh's [[papyrus]]. Donald cautions against taking it with him, as no one would believe the story unless it was unearthed. Donald then buries it and makes a marking point from the [[Nile River]], making Scrooge think to himself admiringly, \"Donald must have swallowed the {{Sic|[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|hide=yes}}!\"\n\n''[[Terror of the Beagle Boys]]'', first published in November 1951, introduced the readers to the Beagle Boys, although Scrooge in this story seems to be already familiar with them. ''[[The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill]]'' introduced Scrooge's [[money bin]], built on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg.\n\nBy this point, Scrooge had become familiar to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney writers and artists besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories, including Italian writer [[Romano Scarpa]]. [[Western Publishing]], the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. ''Uncle Scrooge'' #1, featuring the story ''[[Only a Poor Old Man]]'', was published in March 1952. This story along with ''[[Back to the Klondike]]'', first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined.\n\nAfter this point, Barks produced most of his longer stories in ''Uncle Scrooge'', with a focus mainly on adventure, while his ten-page stories for [[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]] continued to feature Donald as the star and focused on comedy. In Scrooge's stories, Donald and his nephews were cast as Scrooge's assistants, who accompanied Scrooge in his adventures around the world. This change of focus from Donald to Scrooge was also reflected in stories by other contemporary writers. Since then, Scrooge remains a central figure of the Duck comics' universe, thus the coining of the term \"[[Scrooge McDuck Universe]]\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Modern era===\nAfter Barks's retirement, the character continued under other artists. In 1972, Barks was persuaded to write more stories for Disney. He wrote [[Junior Woodchuck]] stories where Scrooge often plays the part of the villain, closer to the role he had before he acquired his own series. Under Barks, Scrooge always was a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot.\n\nThe Italian writer and artist [[Romano Scarpa]] made several additions to Scrooge McDuck's universe, including characters such as [[Brigitta McBridge]], Scrooge's self-styled fianc\u00e9e, and [[Gideon McDuck]], a newspaper editor who is Scrooge's brother. Those characters have appeared mostly in European comics. So is also the case for Scrooge's rival [[John D. Rockerduck]] (created by Barks for just one story) and Donald's cousin [[Fethry Duck]], who sometimes works as a reporter for Scrooge's newspaper.\n\nAnother major development was the arrival of writer and artist [[Don Rosa]] in 1986 with his story \"[[The Son of the Sun]]\", released by [[Gladstone Publishing]] and nominated for a [[Harvey Award]], one of the comics industry's highest honors. Rosa has said in interviews that he considers Scrooge to be his favorite Disney character. Unlike most other Disney writers, Don Rosa considered Scrooge as a historical character whose Disney adventures had occurred in the fifties and sixties and ended (in his undepicted death<ref>{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=GC+HD++77B|Title=Don Rosa's artwork}}</ref>) in 1967 when Barks retired. He considered only Barks' stories canonical, and fleshed out a timeline as well as a family tree based on Barks' stories. Eventually he wrote and drew ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', a full history in twelve chapters which received an [[Eisner Award]] in 1995. Later editions included additional chapters. Under Rosa, Scrooge became more ethical; while he never cheats, he ruthlessly exploits any loopholes. He owes his fortune to his hard work and his money bin is \"full of souvenirs\" since every coin reminds him of a specific circumstance. Rosa remains the foremost contemporary duck artist and has been nominated for five 2007 Eisner Awards. His work is regularly reprinted by itself as well as along with Barks stories for which he created a sequel.\n\n[[Daan Jippes]], who can mimic Barks's art to a close extent, repenciled all of Barks's 1970s Junior Woodchucks stories, as well as Barks' final Uncle Scrooge stories, from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Other notable Disney artists who have worked with the Scrooge character include [[Michael Peraza]], [[Marco Rota]], [[William Van Horn]], and [[Tony Strobl]].\n\nIn an interview with the Norwegian \"Aftenposten\" from 1992 Don Rosa says that \"in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge\" and he also says that this is one of the reasons why he is so interested in Scrooge.\n\n==Characterization==\n===Wealth===\n[[File:Scroogeswim.jpg|left|thumb|Scrooge's signature dive into money]]\nThe character is almost exclusively portrayed as having worked his way up the financial ladder from humble immigrant roots.  The real life of [[Andrew Carnegie]], a Scottish-American immigrant and tycoon of the Industrial Age, and the fictional character of [[Charles Dickens]]' miser [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] are both believed to be strong influences on Scrooge's characterization.\n\nThe comic book series ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', written and drawn by [[Don Rosa]], shows Scrooge as a young boy, he took up a job polishing and shining boots in his native [[Glasgow]]. A pivotal moment comes in 1877, when a ditchdigger pays him with an [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|1875 US dime]], which was useless as currency in 19th century Glasgow; he fails to notice what sort of coin he's been given until after the man has left. Enraged, Scrooge vowed to never be taken advantage of again, to be \"sharper than the sharpies and smarter than the smarties.\" He takes a position as cabin boy on a Clyde cattle ship to the United States to make his fortune at the age of 13. In 1898, after many adventures he finally ends up in Klondike, where he finds a golden rock the size of a goose's egg. By the following year he had made his first $1,000,000 and bought the deed for Killmule Hill from Casey Coot, the son of Clinton Coot and grandson of Cornelius Coot, the founder of Duckburg. He finally ends up in Duckburg in 1902. After some dramatic events where he faces both the Beagle Boys and president Roosevelt and his \"[[Rough Riders]]\" at the same time, he tears down the rest of the old fort Duckburg and builds his famous Money Bin at the site.\n\nIn the years to follow, Scrooge travels all around the world in order to increase his fortune, while his family remained behind to manage the Money Bin. When Scrooge finally returns to Duckburg, he is the richest [[duck]] in the world, rivaled only by [[Flintheart Glomgold]], [[John D. Rockerduck]], and less prominently, the [[maharaja]] of the [[fictional country]] Howdoyoustan (play on [[Hindustan]]). His experiences, however, had changed him into a hostile miser, and he made his own family leave.{{elucidate|date=August 2015}} Some 12 years later, he closed his empire down, but eventually returned to a public life five years later and started his business.\n\nHe keeps the majority of his wealth in a massive Money Bin overlooking the city of Duckburg. In the short ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'', he remarks to his nephews that this money is \"just [[petty cash]]\". In the Dutch and Italian version he regularly forces Donald and his nephews to polish the coins one by one in order to pay off Donald's debts; Scrooge will not pay them much for this lengthy, tedious, hand-breaking work. As far as he is concerned, even 5 cents an hour is too much expenditure.\n\nA shrewd businessman and noted tightwad, he is fond of diving into and swimming in his money, without injury. He is also the richest member of The Billionaires Club of Duckburg, a society which includes the most successful businessmen of the world and allows them to keep connections with each other. Glomgold and Rockerduck are also influential members of the Club. His most famous prized possession is his [[Number One Dime]].\n\n[[File:Scroogemoney.jpg|right|thumb|Valuation of Scrooge assets in Barks' ''The Second Richest Duck'']]\nThe sum of Scrooge's wealth is unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbarks.dk/theserieswealth.htm|title=theserieswealth|website=cbarks.dk}}</ref> According to Barks' ''The Second Richest Duck'' as noted by a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article, Scrooge is worth \"one multiplujillion, nine obsquatumatillion, six hundred twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921233,00.html | title=The Duck with the Bucks |last= Cocks| first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Cocks |date=May 17, 1982 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> In the ''DuckTales'' episode \"Liquid Assets\", [[Fenton Crackshell]] (Scrooge's accountant) notes that McDuck's money bin contains \"607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents\". Don Rosa's ''Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'' notes that Scrooge amounts to \"five multiplujillion, nine impossibidillion, seven fantastica trillion dollars and sixteen cents\". A thought bubble from Scrooge McDuck sitting in his car with his chauffeur in ''Walt Disney's Christmas Parade'' No.1 (published in 1949) that takes place in the story \"Letter to Santa\" clearly states \"What's the use of having 'eleven octillion dollars' if I don't make a big noise about it?\" In ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'', Scrooge mentions \"We quadzillionaires have our own ideas of fun.\" In the first episode of the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 DuckTales series]], Scrooge states that he runs \"a multi-trillion dollar business\".\n\n''[[Forbes]]'' magazine has occasionally tried to estimate Scrooge's wealth in real terms; in 2007, the magazine estimated his wealth at $28.8 billion;<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/11/richest-fictional-characters-oped-books-fict1507-cx_mn_de_1211fictional15_land.html | title=The Forbes Fictional 15 |author=Noer, Michael (ed.) |author2=Ewalt, David M.

A [[running gag]] is Scrooge always making profit on any business deal.<ref>[Walt Disney \"Golden Key\" Comics Digest #January 19, 1970 \"Much Luck McDuck\"]</ref>\n\n===Education===\nScrooge never completed a formal education, as he left school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge has become something of a scholar and an amateur [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.\n\nAs a result of his research, Scrooge has built up an extensive personal library, which includes many rare tomes. In Barks's and Rosa's stories, among the prized pieces of this library is an almost complete collection of Spanish and Dutch naval logs of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their references to the fates of other ships have often allowed Scrooge to locate sunken ships and recover their treasures from their watery graves. Mostly self-taught as he is, Scrooge is a firm believer in the saying \"knowledge is power\". Scrooge is also an accomplished [[linguist]] and entrepreneur, having learned to speak several different languages during his business trips around the world, selling refrigerators to [[Eskimo]]s, wind to windmill manufacturers in the [[Netherlands]], etc.\n\n===Morality and beliefs===\nBoth as a businessman and as a treasure hunter, Scrooge is noted for his drive to set new goals and face new challenges.<ref>[https://mises.org/wire/christmas-lets-celebrate-different-scrooge-scrooge-mcduck This Christmas, Let's Celebrate a Different Scrooge: Scrooge McDuck], [[Mises Institute]]</ref> As Carl Barks described his character, for Scrooge there is \"always another rainbow\". The phrase later provided the title for one of Barks's better-known paintings depicting Scrooge. Periods of inactivity between adventures and lack of serious challenges tend to be depressing for Scrooge after a while; some stories see these phases take a toll on his health. Scrooge's other motto is \"Work smarter, not harder.\"\n\nAs a businessman, Scrooge often resorts to aggressive tactics and deception. He seems to have gained significant experience in manipulating people and events towards his own ends. As often seen in stories by writer [[Guido Martina]] and occasionally by others, Scrooge is noted for his [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], especially towards ideals of [[morality]] when it comes to business and the pursuit of set goals. This has been noted by some as not being part of Barks's original profile of the character, but has since come to be accepted as one valid interpretation of Scrooge's way of thinking.\n\nScrooge seems to have a personal code of honesty that offers him an amount of self-control. He can often be seen contemplating the next course of action, divided between adopting a ruthless pursuit of his current goal against those tactics he considers more honest. At times, he can sacrifice his goal in order to remain within the limits of this sense of honesty. Several fans of the character have come to consider these depictions as adding to the depth of his personality, because based on the decisions he takes Scrooge can be both the [[hero]] and the [[villain]] of his stories. This is one thing he has in common with his nephew [[Donald Duck|Donald]]. Scrooge's sense of honesty also distinguishes him from his rival [[Flintheart Glomgold]], who places no such self-limitations. During the cartoon series ''DuckTales'', at times he would be heard saying to Glomgold, \"You're a cheater, and cheaters ''never'' prosper!\"\n\nLike his nephew Donald, Scrooge has also a temper (but not as a strong temper as his nephew) and rarely hesitates to use cartoon violence against those who provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, he seems to be against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in [[fairy tale]]s do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word\u2014never breaking a promise once given.<ref>An example is when Scrooge, his family and the Beagle Boys are trapped in the past. Hatching a plan to return to their normal time, he is told they could easily leave the Beagles stranded in the past; Scrooge refuses, noting that he gave his word everyone would return safely.</ref> In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.\n\nCarl Barks gave Scrooge a definite set of ethics which were in tone with the time he was supposed to have made his fortune. The [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]] and industrialists of the 1890\u20131920s era were McDuck's competition as he earned his fortune. Scrooge proudly asserts \"I made it by being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties! And I made it square!\" Barks's creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth. When Disney filmmakers first contemplated a Scrooge feature cartoon in the fifties, the animators had no understanding of the Scrooge McDuck character and merely envisioned Scrooge as a duck version of Ebenezer Scrooge\u2014a very unsympathetic character. In the end they shelved the idea because a duck who gets all excited about money just was not funny enough.\n\nIn an interview, Barks summed up his beliefs about Scrooge and [[capitalism]]:\n\n{{quote|I've always looked at the ducks as caricatured human beings. In rereading the stories, I realized that I had gotten kind of deep in some of them: there was philosophy in there that I hadn't realized I was putting in. It was an added feature that went along with the stories. I think a lot of the philosophy in my stories is [[Traditionalist conservatism|conservative]]\u2014conservative in the sense that I feel our civilization peaked around 1910. Since then we've been going downhill. Much of the older culture had basic qualities that the new stuff we keep hatching can never match.\n\nLook at the magnificent cathedrals and palaces that were built. Nobody can build that sort of thing nowadays. Also, I believe that we should preserve many old ideals and methods of working: honor, honesty, allowing other people to believe in their own ideas, not trying to force everyone into one form. The thing I have against the present political system is that it tries to make everybody exactly alike. We should have a million different patterns.\n\nThey say that wealthy people like the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers are sinful because they accumulated fortunes by exploiting the poor. I feel that everybody should be able to rise as high as they can or want to, provided they don't kill anybody or actually oppress other people on the way up. A little exploitation is something you come by in nature. We see it in the pecking order of animals\u2014everybody has to be exploited or to exploit someone else to a certain extent. I don't resent those things.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barks|first=Carl|title=Carl Barks: Conversations|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-501-1}}</ref>}}\n\n===''DuckTales''===\n[[File:ScroogeWithNephews.jpg|thumb|left|Scrooge stars alongside his great-nephews in ''[[DuckTales]]'']]\nIn the ''[[DuckTales]]'' series, Scrooge has adopted the nephews (as Donald has joined the Navy and is away on his tour of duty), and as a result his darker personality traits are downplayed. While most of his persona remain from the comics, he is notably more [[Optimism|optimistic]] and less irritable in the animated cartoon. In an early episode, Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby (his housekeeper's granddaughter, who comes to live in Scrooge's mansion), saying that \"for the first time since I left [[Scotland]], I have a family\". Though Scrooge is far from tyrannical in the comics, he is rarely so openly affectionate. While he still hunts for treasure in ''DuckTales'', many episodes focus on his attempts to thwart villains. However, he remains just as tightfisted with money as he has always been. But he's also affable and patient with his family and friends.\n\nScrooge displays a strict code of honor, insisting that the only valid way to acquire [[wealth]] is to \"earn it square,\" and he goes to great lengths to thwart those (sometimes even his own nephews) who gain money dishonestly. This code also prevents him from ever being dishonest himself, and he avows that \"Scrooge McDuck's word is as good as gold.\" He also expresses great disgust at being viewed by others as a greedy liar and cheater.\n\nThe series fleshes out Scrooge's upbringing by depicting his life as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest but also, he defends his family and friends from any dangers, including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer the most important thing in his life. For one episode, he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.\n\nOn occasion, he demonstrates considerable physical strength by single-handedly beating bigger foes. He credits his robustness to \"lifting money bags.\"\n\n===Voice===\nAnother part of Scrooge's persona is his Scottish accent. [[Dallas McKennon]] was the first actor to provide Scrooge's voice for the 1960 [[Disneyland Records]] album, ''Donald Duck and His Friends''.\n\nWhen Scrooge later made his animated debut in ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'' in 1967, he was voiced by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]]. Thompson had previously voiced Jock the [[Scottish Terrier]] in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' and, according to [[Alan Young]], Thompson had some Scottish ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicshowbiz.blogspot.com/2010/12/interview-with-alan-young.html|title=An Interview with Alan Young|date=December 4, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Following ''Scrooge McDuck and Money'''s release, Scrooge made no further animated appearances prior to Thompson's death in 1971.\n\nIn 1974, Disneyland Records produced the album, ''An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players''. Alan Young belonged to a Dickens Society and was asked to help adapt the story to fit in the classic Disney characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mydailyfind.com/2009/12/01/mister-eds-alan-young-talks-about-the-talking-horse-and-hollywood-lore/|title=Mister Ed's Alan Young about the talking horse and Hollywood lore|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Young, whose parents were Scottish and who lived in Scotland for a few years when he was an infant,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://colemanzone.com/Time_Machine_Project/filby.htm|title=Interview with Alan Young|date=October 19, 1999|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> voiced Scrooge for this record in addition to voicing [[Mickey Mouse]] and Merlin from ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''. When Disney decided to adapt the record into the 1983 theatrical short, ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', Young returned to voice Scrooge. Young remained as Disney's official voice for Scrooge until his death in 2016, although [[Will Ryan]] voiced Scrooge for the 1987 television special, ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' and [[Alan Reid (musician)|Alan Reid]] voiced Scrooge for [[Tuomas Holopainen]]'s 2014 album, ''[[Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge]]''. Young's last performance as Scrooge was in the 2016 ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short, \"No\".\n\nSince Young's death, several actors have provided Scrooge's voice. [[John Kassir]] has voiced Scrooge for the ''Mickey Mouse'' shorts starting with \"Duck the Halls\" in 2016. [[Eric Bauza]] voiced Scrooge for a cameo in the television series, ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]''. Scottish actor [[Enn Reitel]] voices Scrooge for Disney park appearances as well as in the English dub of ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n\n[[David Tennant]] voices Scrooge for the 2017 reboot of ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]''. According to executive producer Matt Youngberg:\n\n{{quote|David Tennant seemed to be the natural choice for this. We really wanted to find somebody who was legitimately Scottish. We thought that was really important in this iteration, someone who had the character to bring this icon alive. And David is an amazing actor. He\u2019s morphed into this role in an incredible way.}}\n\n===Europe===\nMany of the European comics based on the Disney Universe have created their own version of Scrooge McDuck, usually involving him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s\u20131980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or [[blunderbuss]], or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings up at the end of the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb \u2013 something which Scrooge shows little concern for \u2013 he tends to end up with nothing.\n\nAnother running joke is Scrooge reminiscing about his adventures while [[gold prospecting]] in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] much to Donald and the nephews' chagrin at hearing the never-ending and tiresome stories.\n\n===Age===\nAccording to Carl Barks' 1955 one-pager \"Watt an Occasion\" (''Uncle Scrooge'' #12), Scrooge is 75 years of age. According to Don Rosa, Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, and earned his Number One Dime (or First Coin) exactly ten years later. The ''DuckTales'' episodes (and many European comics) show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th century, yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s. Despite this extremely advanced age, Scrooge does not appear to be on the verge of dotage, and is vigorous enough to keep up with his nephews in adventures; with rare exception, there appears to be no sign of him slowing down.\n\nBarks responded to some fan letters asking about Scrooge's Adamic age, that in the story \"That's No Fable!\", when Scrooge drank water from a [[Fountain of Youth]] for several days, rather than making him young again (bodily contact with the water was required for that), ingesting the water rejuvenated his body and cured him of his [[rheumatism|rheumatia]], which arguably allowed Scrooge to live beyond his expected years with no sign of slowdown or senility. Don Rosa's solution to the issue of Scrooge's age is that he set all of his stories in the 1950s or earlier, which was when he himself discovered and reveled in Barks' stories as a kid, and in his unofficial timelines, he had Scrooge die in 1967, at the age of 100 years.<ref>https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~starback/dcml/creators/rosa-on-himself.html#dates</ref><ref>https://inducks.org/s.php?c=GC+HD++77B</ref>\n\nIn the 15th episode of the 2017 ''DuckTales'' reboot, \"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\", it is revealed that Scrooge was \"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\" called Demogorgana for an unknown amount of time, which is used to explain his young look.<ref>\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\"</ref> In the 19th episode, \"The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!\", Webby Vanderquack's research on Scrooge reveals that he was born in 1867.<ref>\"The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!\"</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Cultural impact===\n''[[Forbes]]'' magazine routinely lists Scrooge McDuck on its annual \"[[Forbes Fictional 15|Fictional 15]]\" list of the richest fictional characters by net worth:\n{|\n|- valign =\"top\"\n|\n* 2002: #4 with $8.2 billion<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/09/13/400fictional_5.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2002 |last= Noer | first=Michael; and Dan Ackman|date=September 13, 2002 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2005: #6 with $8.2 billion<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/fictional/06.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2005 |last= Herper | first=Matthew|date=November 20, 2005 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2006: #3 with $10.9 billion<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/scrooge-mcduck-money-tech-media_cx_mn_06fict15_duck.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2006 |last= Noer| first=Michael|date=November 20, 2006 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2007: #1 with $28.8 billion ([[Pound sterling|\u20a4]]17.6 billion)<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/11/scrooge-mcduck-money-oped-books-cx_mh_fict1507_1211scrooge.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2007 | last=Herper | first=Matthew |date=December 11, 2007 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n|\n* 2008: #2 with $29.1 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/18/scrooge-mcduck-money-oped-fictional1508-cx_de_1218scrooge.html | work=Forbes | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | title=No. 2 McDuck, Scrooge | date=December 18, 2008}}</ref>\n* 2010: #2 with $33.5 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/13/scrooge-mcduck-bio-opinions-fictional-15-10-scrooge.html | work=Forbes | first=Matthew | last=Herper | title=No. 2 McDuck, Scrooge | date=April 14, 2010}}</ref>\n* 2011: #1 with $44.1 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/fictional15/2011/profile/scrooge-mcduck.html | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2011 | work=Forbes}}</ref>\n* 2013: #1 with $65.4 billion<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlg45edmmd/1-scrooge-mcduck/ | title=The Forbes Fictional Fifteen, 2013 | work=Forbes | first=David M. | last=Ewalt}}</ref>\n|}\n\nGrupo Ronda S.A has the license to use the character, as well as other Disney characters in the board game ''T\u00edo Rico Mc.

The popularity of the [[Duck universe]] \u2013 the fandom term for the associated intellectual properties that have developed from Scrooge's stories over the years, including the city of [[Duckburg]] \u2013 has led Don Rosa to claim that \"in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge.\"\n\nIn addition to the many [[List of characters from the Scrooge McDuck universe|original and existing characters]] in stories about Scrooge McDuck, authors have frequently led historical figures to meet Scrooge over the course of his life. Most notably, Scrooge has met US president [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt and Scrooge would meet each other at least three times: in the Dakotas in 1883, in Duckburg in 1902, and in Panama in 1906. ''See [[List of characters from the Scrooge McDuck universe#Historical figures in Scrooge McDuck stories|Historical Figures in Scrooge McDuck stories]]''.\n\nBased on writer [[Don Rosa]]'s ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', a popular timeline chronicling Scrooge's adventures was created consisting of the most important \"facts\" about Scrooge's life.

Scrooge's voice was first heard on the 1960 record album ''Donald Duck and His Friends;'' [[Dal McKennon]] voiced the character for this appearance. It took the form of a short dramatization called \"Uncle Scrooge's Rocket to the Moon,\" a story of how Scrooge builds a rocket to send all his money to the moon to protect it from the Beagle Boys.<ref name=\"cartoonresearch1\">{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mickeys-christmas-carol/|title=\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" -|website=cartoonresearch.com}}</ref> In 1961 this story was reissued as a 45rpm single record entitled \"Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge's Money Rocket.\"\n\nInitially, Scrooge was to make his animated debut in the Donald Duck theatrical cartoons. Late in 1954, Carl Barks was asked by the Disney Studios if he would be free to write a script for a Scrooge McDuck 7-minute animated cartoon.<ref>http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonapproach.htm</ref> Scrooge was a huge success in the comic books at the time, and Disney now wanted to introduce the miserly duck to theater audiences as well. Barks supplied the studios with a detailed 9-page script, telling the story of the happy-go-lucky Donald Duck working for the troubled Scrooge who tries to save his money from a hungry rat.<ref>http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonsynopsis.htm</ref> Barks also sent number of sketches of his ideas for the short, including a money-sorting machine, which Barks had already used on the cover of one of the Uncle Scrooge issues.<ref>http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonsketches.htm</ref> The script was never used as Disney soon after decided to concentrate on TV shows instead.\n\nScrooge's first appearance in animated form (save for a brief ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' television series cameo) was in Disney's 1967 theatrical short ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'' (voiced by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]]), in which he teaches his nephews basic financial tips.<ref>Berg, Bill (writer) & Hamilton, Luske (director). ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'', [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]. March 23, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[Disneyland Records]] released an adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] classic ''[[A Christmas Carol]] ''. Eight years later, the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] decided to make a [[featurette]] of this same story, this time dubbed ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983). He also appeared as himself in the television special ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' (1987).\n\nScrooge's biggest role outside comics would come in the 1987 [[animated series]] ''[[DuckTales]]'', a series loosely based on Carl Barks's comics, and where [[Alan Young]] returned to voice him. In this series, premiered over two-hours on September 18, 1987, while the regular episodes began three days later, Scrooge becomes the legal guardian of Huey, Dewey and Louie when Donald joins the [[United States Navy]]. Scrooge's ''DuckTales'' persona is considerably mellow compared to most previous appearances; his aggression is played down and his often duplicitous personality is reduced in many episodes to that of a curmudgeonly but well-meaning old uncle. Still, there are flashes of Barks' Scrooge to be seen, particularly in early episodes of the first season. Scrooge also appeared in ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'', released during the series' run. He was mentioned in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode \"Tiff of the Titans\", but never really seen.<!--seen or not?-->\n\nHe has appeared in some episodes of ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', two shorts of ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and some episodes (specially \"House of Scrooge\") of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', as well as the [[direct-to-video]] films ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''. His video game appearances include the three ''DuckTales'' releases (''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'', ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: The Quest for Gold]]''), and in ''[[Toontown Online]]'' as the accidental creator of the Cogs. Additionally, he is a secret playable character in 2008 quiz game, ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''. In the 2012 [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', he is one of the first characters Mickey rescues, running a shop in the fortress selling upgrades and serving as a Sketch summon in which he uses his cane pogostick from the Ducktales NES games.\n\n[[File:Scrooge in KH2.jpg|thumb|Scrooge in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'']]\nScrooge also makes sporadic appearances in Disney's and [[Square Enix]]'s ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, helping Mickey Mouse establish a world transit system to expand his business empire to other worlds.

He works on establishing an ice-cream business in Radiant Garden and gives Ventus three passes to the Dream Festival in Disney Town. Scrooge returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', now managing a bistro in Twilight Town with the help of Remy from ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. Alan Young reprises the role in the English version of ''Birth by Sleep'', while [[Enn Reitel]] voices the character in ''III''.\n\nScrooge has appeared in the [[Boom! Studios]] ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' comic, playing a key role at the end of its initial story, \"The Duck Knight Returns\". Later he would also play a key role on the final story arc \"[[Dangerous Currency]]\", where he teams up with Darkwing Duck in order to stop the [[Phantom Blot]] and [[Magica De Spell]] from taking over St. Canard and Duckburg.\n\nIn 2015, Scrooge was seen in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short \"Goofy's First Love\", where Mickey and Donald are trying to help Goofy find his love. Donald suggests money, and they head over to Scrooge's mansion where Donald tells his uncle that Goofy needs a million dollars. Scrooge then has his butler kick them out. When Goofy is inadvertently launched from a treadmill and catapulted off another building, he lands in Scrooge's mansion. The butler kicks Goofy out and the process repeats itself but this time Mickey and Donald are catapulted as well and kicked out by the butler. Scrooge is seen at the end attending Goofy's wedding with a sandwich. In the 2016 ''Mickey Mouse'' Christmas special, \"Duck the Halls\", after Young's death, [[John Kassir]] took over voicing Scrooge McDuck, however he later [[Twitter|tweeted]] that he won't be reprising his role in the reboot. Kassir continues to voice the character in subsequent appearances in this series. Scrooge makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'' episode \"Shangri-La-Di-Da\".\n\nIn the new ''DuckTales,'' Scrooge is played by Scottish actor [[David Tennant]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2017/03/first-look-david-tennant-voices-scrooge-mcduck-in-ducktales|title=First Look: David Tennant Voices Scrooge McDuck in 'DuckTales' {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}</ref> This series shows that Scrooge previously adventured with his nephew Donald and his niece [[Della Duck]], but when Della disappeared during an expedition to space, Donald blamed Scrooge and the two became estranged for ten years.

In the late 2010s she befriended [[Kesha]] with the two collaborating on each others\u2019 projects. Freedia is going on tour with Kesha in 2020, and has a new album coming out.\n\n==Early life==\nFreddie Ross was born in New Orleans, [[Louisiana]]. As a child, Freedia took piano and sang in [[choir]],<ref name=\"DeathSexAndMoney\">{{cite podcast|url= http://www.wnyc.org/story/in-new-orleans-big-freedia/|title=in New Orleans: Big Freedia Bounces Back|website=Wnyc.org|host= Anna Sale|date=August 19, 2015|access-date=Aug 21, 2015}}</ref> and has said that music was always a part of his life. His mother exposed him to artists such as [[Patti LaBelle]], and he was also influenced by the late [[disco]] singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]].<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nRoss attended [[Cohen College Prep High School|Walter L. Cohen High School]], where he continued to perform in choir and also became the choir director. This experience made him realize he could write and produce.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> According to Freedia, he initially suffered from stage-fright, and had to coax himself onto stage until he became comfortable performing.<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nIn 1998, a young [[drag queen]] by the name of [[Katey Red]] performed [[bounce music]] at a club near the [[Melpomene Projects]] where Ross grew up. Ross, who had grown up four blocks away from Katey Red, began performing as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> In 1999, Katey Red released ''Melpomene Block Party'' on the city's leading bounce label, Take Fo Records.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Freedia adopted his stage name after a friend dubbed him \"Freedia\" (pronounced \"Freeda\"). According to Ross, \"I wanted a catchy name that rhymed, and my mother had a club called Diva that I worked for. I called myself the queen of diva\u2014so I coined it: Big Freedia Queen Diva.\"<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1999, Freedia released his first [[Single (music)|single]], \"An Ha, Oh Yeah,\" and began performing frequently in clubs and other venues in New Orleans. Other local hits included \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Gin 'N My System,\" which was later quoted by [[Lil Wayne]] on a mix tape. He released his first studio album, ''Queen Diva,'' in 2003.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/><ref name=\"fensterstock\"/><ref name=\"dodero2010\"/>\n\nFreedia was often described as an artist within the \"sissy bounce\" subgenre,<ref name=\"cadogan2007\"/> though he had stated \"there's no such thing as separating it into straight bounce and sissy bounce. It's all bounce music.\"<ref name=\"flaherty\"/> About his popularity with women at live shows, music journalist Alison Fensterstock wrote, \"When Freedia or Sissy Nobby's singing super aggressive, sexual lyrics about bad boyfriends or whatever, there's something about being able to be the 'I' in the sentence...it's tough to sing along about bitches and hoes when you're a girl. When you identify with Freedia, you're the agent of all this aggressive sexuality instead of its object.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans in 2005, and Freedia, along with other bounce artists such as Katey Red and Freedia's protege Sissy Nobby, were forced to vacate the city. Freedia settled for several months in [[Texas]], where he began performing bounce shows for the locals, helping spread awareness of the genre like other displaced bounce artists. He moved back to New Orleans at the first opportunity. According to Freedia, \"The first club that reopened in New Orleans was Caesar's, and they called me immediately and said let's do a regular night with you here. So we started [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Fridays. It was the only club open in the city, and a lot of people had a lot of money from Katrina, the checks and stuff, so the joy inside that club\u2014I don't think that'll ever come back.\"<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nHe played six to ten shows a week at [[Block party|block parties]], nightclubs, strip clubs, and other venues while the city recuperated.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> According to Fensterstock, \"Freedia was one of the first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and he worked really, really hard. If you lived here, it became impossible not to know who he was.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n===Mainstream exposure===\nFreedia first began to gain national exposure after a 2009 fest-closing gig with Katey Red and Sissy Nobby at the [[The New Orleans Bingo! Show|Bingo Parlour Tent]] and the 2009 [[Voodoo Music + Arts Experience|Voodoo Experience]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> On January 18, 2010, she self-released the album ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' on Big Freedia Records.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was a collection of previously performed singles from 1999 to 2010.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, she was booked for a showcase of New Orleans bounce music at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], but cancelled after an injury. She signed to the Windish Agency afterwards, and booked a summer tour.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Along with Katey Red, Cheeky Blakk, and Sissy Nobby, she was a guest on the May 2010 album ''Ya-ka-may'' by [[funk]] band [[Galactic]].<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> She joined the band for several gigs, and the album peaked at #161 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|US ''Billboard'' Chart]].<ref name=\"ya\"/>\n\nIn May 2010, Freedia began touring with DJ Rusty Lazer and a team of \"bootydancers,\" along with pop band [[Matt and Kim]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> She performed at Hoodstock in [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bed\u2013Stuy]], [[Brooklyn]] in May 2010, and afterwards was written up in the ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref name=\"dodero2010\"/> She performed for [[contemporary art]] mogul Jeffrey Deitch at [[Art Basel|Basel Miami]] and at New York's [[MoMa]] art museum.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Upon returning to New Orleans, she was pursued by a New York journalist and was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 22, 2010.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> She continued to tour throughout the United States, and in Fall 2010 had her first national television appearance on the ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> In October 2010, the ''[[The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate|New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' called her an \"overnight sensation\".<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Freedia was named Best Emerging Artist and Best Hip-Hop/Rap Artist in January's \"Best of the Beat Awards.\" ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' was nominated by the [[22nd GLAAD Media Awards]] in 2011.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was re-released on [[Scion Audio/Visual|Scion A/V]] in March 2011, along with a number of music videos.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/> She also won an MTV 0 Award in 2012 for \"Too Much Ass for TV.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 2\">{{cite news|last1=Benjamin|first1=Jeff|title=MTV O Music Awards: Recapping 23 Awards In 24 Hours As The Flaming Lips Break A World Record|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1084857/mtv-o-music-awards-recapping-23-awards-in-24-hours-as-the-flaming-lips|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=Billboard 2|date=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', a drama following residents of New Orleans as they try to rebuild after Katrina.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> She performed on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on January 25, 2012.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> Her performance at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2012 was reviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \"Probably this writer's favorite SXSW set.\"<ref name=\"stone\"/>\n\nFreedia toured with [[The Postal Service]] in 2013, opening for the band at numerous venues throughout July and August.<ref>{{cite web|author=E&E |url=http://www.bigfreedia.com/tour/ |title=Tour |publisher=Big Freedia |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Queen of Bounce}}In 2013, music television channel [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] aired the first season of ''Big Freedia: Queen of Bounce'', a reality show chronicling Freedia's growing mainstream attention and life back in New Orleans.

In 2018, she released the EP ''Third Ward Bounce''.\n\nShe also provided additional vocals for [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s 2018 number-one hit \"[[Nice for What]]\", though she is not credited as a featured artist. In the late 2010s she befriended [[Kesha]] with the two collaborating on each others\u2019 projects. Freedia is going on tour with Kesha in 2020, and has a new album coming out.\n\n==Early life==\nFreddie Ross was born in New Orleans, [[Louisiana]]. As a child, Freedia took piano and sang in [[choir]],<ref name=\"DeathSexAndMoney\">{{cite podcast|url= http://www.wnyc.org/story/in-new-orleans-big-freedia/|title=in New Orleans: Big Freedia Bounces Back|website=Wnyc.org|host= Anna Sale|date=August 19, 2015|access-date=Aug 21, 2015}}</ref> and has said that music was always a part of her life. Her mother exposed her to artists such as [[Patti LaBelle]], and she was also influenced by the late [[disco]] singer [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Salt-N-Pepa]].<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nRoss attended [[Cohen College Prep High School|Walter L. Cohen High School]], where she continued to perform in choir and also became the choir director. This experience made her realize she could write and produce.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> According to Freedia, she initially suffered from stage-fright, and had to coax herself onto stage until she became comfortable performing.<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\nIn 1998, a young [[drag queen]] by the name of [[Katey Red]] performed [[bounce music]] at a club near the [[Melpomene Projects]] where Ross grew up. Ross, who had grown up four blocks away from Katey Red, began performing as a backup dancer and singer in Red's shows.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> In 1999, Katey Red released ''Melpomene Block Party'' on the city's leading bounce label, Take Fo Records.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Freedia adopted her stage name after a friend dubbed her \"Freedia\" (pronounced \"Freeda\"). According to Ross, \"I wanted a catchy name that rhymed, and my mother had a club called Diva that I worked for. I called myself the queen of diva\u2014so I coined it: Big Freedia Queen Diva.\"<ref name=\"playjones\"/>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nIn 1999, Freedia released her first [[Single (music)|single]], \"An Ha, Oh Yeah,\" and began performing frequently in clubs and other venues in New Orleans. Other local hits included \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Gin 'N My System,\" which was later quoted by [[Lil Wayne]] on a mix tape. She released her first studio album, ''Queen Diva,'' in 2003.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/><ref name=\"fensterstock\"/><ref name=\"dodero2010\"/>\n\nFreedia was often described as an artist within the \"sissy bounce\" subgenre,<ref name=\"cadogan2007\"/> though she had stated \"there's no such thing as separating it into straight bounce and sissy bounce. It's all bounce music.\"<ref name=\"flaherty\"/> About her popularity with women at live shows, music journalist Alison Fensterstock wrote, \"When Freedia or Sissy Nobby's singing superaggressive, sexual lyrics about bad boyfriends or whatever, there's something about being able to be the 'I' in the sentence...it's tough to sing along about bitches and hoes when you're a girl. When you identify with Freedia, you're the agent of all this aggressive sexuality instead of its object.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n[[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans in 2005, and Freedia, along with other bounce artists such as Katey Red and Freedia's protege Sissy Nobby, were forced to vacate the city. Freedia settled for several months in [[Texas]], where she began performing bounce shows for the locals, helping spread awareness of the genre like other displaced bounce artists. She moved back to New Orleans at the first opportunity. According to Freedia, \"The first club that reopened in New Orleans was Caesar's, and they called me immediately and said let's do a regular night with you here. So we started [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Fridays. It was the only club open in the city, and a lot of people had a lot of money from Katrina, the checks and stuff, so the joy inside that club\u2014I don't think that'll ever come back.\"<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nShe played six to ten shows a week at [[Block party|block parties]], nightclubs, strip clubs, and other venues while the city recuperated.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> According to Fensterstock, \"Freedia was one of the first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and [s]he worked really, really hard. If you lived here, it became impossible not to know who [s]he was.\"<ref name=\"dee2010\"/>\n\n===Mainstream exposure===\nFreedia first began to gain national exposure after a 2009 fest-closing gig with Katey Red and Sissy Nobby at the [[The New Orleans Bingo! Show|Bingo Parlour Tent]] and the 2009 [[Voodoo Music + Arts Experience|Voodoo Experience]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> On January 18, 2010, she self-released the album ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' on Big Freedia Records.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was a collection of previously performed singles from 1999 to 2010.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn March 2010, she was booked for a showcase of New Orleans bounce music at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], but cancelled after an injury. She signed to the Windish Agency afterwards, and booked a summer tour.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Along with Katey Red, Cheeky Blakk, and Sissy Nobby, she was a guest on the May 2010 album ''Ya-ka-may'' by [[funk]] band [[Galactic]].<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> She joined the band for several gigs, and the album peaked at #161 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|US ''Billboard'' Chart]].<ref name=\"ya\"/>\n\nIn May 2010, Freedia began touring with DJ Rusty Lazer and a team of \"bootydancers,\" along with pop band [[Matt and Kim]].<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> She performed at Hoodstock in [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bed\u2013Stuy]], [[Brooklyn]] in May 2010, and afterwards was written up in the ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref name=\"dodero2010\"/> She performed for [[contemporary art]] mogul Jeffrey Deitch at [[Art Basel|Basel Miami]] and at New York's [[MoMa]] art museum.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> Upon returning to New Orleans, she was pursued by a New York journalist and was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 22, 2010.<ref name=\"dee2010\"/> She continued to tour throughout the United States, and in Fall 2010 had her first national television appearance on the ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/> In October 2010, the ''[[The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate|New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' called her an \"overnight sensation\".<ref name=\"fensterstock\"/>\n\nIn 2011, Freedia was named Best Emerging Artist and Best Hip-Hop/Rap Artist in January's \"Best of the Beat Awards.\" ''Big Freedia Hitz Vol. 1'' was nominated by the [[22nd GLAAD Media Awards]] in 2011.<ref name=\"sullivan2011\"/> The album was re-released on [[Scion Audio/Visual|Scion A/V]] in March 2011, along with a number of music videos.<ref name=\"zeichner2011\"/> She also won an MTV 0 Award in 2012 for \"Too Much Ass for TV.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 2\">{{cite news|last1=Benjamin|first1=Jeff|title=MTV O Music Awards: Recapping 23 Awards In 24 Hours As The Flaming Lips Break A World Record|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1084857/mtv-o-music-awards-recapping-23-awards-in-24-hours-as-the-flaming-lips|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=Billboard 2|date=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]'', a drama following residents of New Orleans as they try to rebuild after Katrina.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> She performed on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on January 25, 2012.<ref name=\"playjones\"/> Her performance at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2012 was reviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \"Probably this writer's favorite SXSW set.\"<ref name=\"stone\"/>\n\nFreedia toured with [[The Postal Service]] in 2013, opening for the band at numerous venues throughout July and August.<ref>{{cite web|author=E&E |url=http://www.bigfreedia.com/tour/ |title=Tour |publisher=Big Freedia |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Queen of Bounce}}In 2013, music television channel [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] aired the first season of ''Big Freedia: Queen of Bounce'', a reality show chronicling Freedia's growing mainstream attention and life back in New Orleans.
