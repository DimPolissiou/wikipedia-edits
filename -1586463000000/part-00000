Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells,  known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].\n\nThe three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:\n# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\n# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.\n# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n\nThe first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.<ref>Villarreal, Luis P.

In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D\u2019Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.<ref>Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554</ref> [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscopes]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupr\u00e9|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}</ref><ref>William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392</ref> In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.<ref name=Gest />\n\nExtensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His was a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress in microscope technology until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\"/>\n\nOptical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. The development of the [[electron microscope]] in the 1920s made it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again opening up new possibilities in science.<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\" />\n\n== Discovery of cells ==\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]\n\nThe cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]].

Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named \"cells\".

However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.<ref>{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635\u20131703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}</ref> \nWhat Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing.

In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe \u201cseeds\u201d that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.<ref name=Gest />\n\n[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.<ref name=\"Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1\"/> Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these \u201canimalcules,\u201d which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\" /> Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study \"pepper water\" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.<ref name=Gest />\n\nThe cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.<ref name=\"History of Biology\">{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]].

The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].\nThe idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn\u2019t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.\n\n===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===\n\nTwo opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}</ref> The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.\nThe [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33\u201359|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}</ref> Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.\nOver the same time period, it was shown (Procter & Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form\u2014the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water\u2014and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.\nBy the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks & Brooks published a monograph, \"The Permeability of Living Cells\", which rejects the bulk phase theories.\n\n===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===\n\nWith the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.\nThe tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.\n \nThe modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.\nThese major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact\u2014there are, however, a few dissenters.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===\n\nIn 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.\n\nIn 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.\n\n== Types of cells ==\n{{Main|Cell types}}\n[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|right|[[Prokaryote]] cell.]]\n[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Eukaryote cell.]]\nCells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:\n\n# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.<ref name=w11>Wolfe, p.&nbsp;11</ref> Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s).

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells,  known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].\n\nThe three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:\n# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\n# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.\n# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n\nThe first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.<ref>Villarreal, Luis P.

In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D\u2019Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.<ref>Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554</ref> [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscopes]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620<ref>{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupr\u00e9|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}</ref><ref>William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392</ref> In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.<ref name=Gest />\n\nExtensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His was a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress in microscope technology until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\"/>\n\nOptical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. The development of the [[electron microscope]] in the 1920s made it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again opening up new possibilities in science.<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\" />\n\n== Discovery of cells ==\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]\n\nThe cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]].

Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named \"cells\".

However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.<ref>{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635\u20131703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}</ref> \nWhat Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing.

In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe \u201cseeds\u201d that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.<ref name=Gest />\n\n[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.<ref name=\"Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1\"/> Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these \u201canimalcules,\u201d which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\" /> Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study \"pepper water\" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.<ref name=Gest />\n\nThe cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.<ref name=\"History of Biology\">{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]].

The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].\nThe idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn\u2019t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.\n\n===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===\n\nTwo opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}</ref> The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.\nThe [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33\u201359|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}</ref> Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.\nOver the same time period, it was shown (Procter & Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form\u2014the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water\u2014and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.\nBy the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks & Brooks published a monograph, \"The Permeability of Living Cells\", which rejects the bulk phase theories.\n\n===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===\n\nWith the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.\nThe tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.\n \nThe modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.\nThese major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact\u2014there are, however, a few dissenters.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===\n\nIn 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.\n\nIn 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.\n\n== Types of cells ==\n{{Main|Cell types}}\n[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|right|[[Prokaryote]] cell.]]\n[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Eukaryote cell.]]\nCells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:\n\n# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.<ref name=w11>Wolfe, p.&nbsp;11</ref> Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s).

He won his sole major championship at the [[2008 Masters Tournament]].\n\n==Early years==\nImmelman was born in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. Born into a golfing family. His father, Johan, is the former commissioner of the [[Sunshine Tour]] in South Africa, while his older brother [[Mark Immelman|Mark]] is a broadcaster, teaching pro and collegiate golf coach. Trevor took up golf at the age of five. He attended [[Hottentots Holland High School]]. He won the [[U.S. Amateur Public Links]] in 1998.\n\n==Professional career==\nImmelman turned professional in 1999. In 2000 he played mainly on the second tier professional tour in Europe, the [[Challenge Tour]], and finished tenth on the Order of Merit. He became a full member of the [[European Tour]] in 2001 and has made the top twenty of the Order of Merit three times. He has four wins on the European Tour, and in 2004 became the first man to successfully defend the [[South African Open (golf)|South African Open]] title since [[Gary Player]] in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2003 Immelman won the [[WGC-World Cup]] for South Africa in partnership with [[Rory Sabbatini]]. In 2005 he was a member of the losing International Team at the [[Presidents Cup]]. He has been playing with increasing frequency on the [[PGA Tour]] after receiving a 2-year PGA Tour exemption for 2006 and 2007 on account of this Presidents Cup appearance. In 2006 Immelman won his first PGA Tour event at the [[Cialis Western Open]], a result that moved him into the top 15 in the [[Official World Golf Rankings]]. He won the [[Sunshine Tour]] Order of Merit in 2002/03.\n\nImmelman withdrew from the 2006 [[Open Championship]] to be present for the birth of his first child. He finished 2006 in the top 10 of the PGA Tour money list and was named [[PGA Tour Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]]. In September 2007, Trevor Immelman was picked by [[Gary Player]] to participate in the 7th [[Presidents Cup]] held at the [[Royal Montreal Golf Club]], Canada. The International team lost 14.5 to the US team's 19.5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentscup.com/past-results.html |title=The Presidents Cup \u2013 Past Results |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202134720/http://www.presidentscup.com/past-results.html |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 13 December 2007, Immelman withdrew from the [[South African Open (golf)|South African Airways Open]] due to severe discomfort around his ribcage area and a problem breathing. He went into surgery the following Tuesday, 18 December 2007, and doctors discovered a [[lesion]] approximately the size of a golf ball on his [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. (Immelman remarked in an interview on the obvious irony of the size of the lesion).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/2007/r/players/12/18/immelman.surgery/index.html |publisher=PGA Tour |title=Immelman undergoes surgery to remove growth on his diaphragm |date=18 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220072620/http://www.pgatour.com/2007/r/players/12/18/immelman.surgery/index.html |archivedate=20 December 2007}}</ref> It was diagnosed as a calcified [[Fibrous connective tissue|fibrosis]] [[tumor]]. After more tests they discovered that it was [[Benign tumor|benign]].  Nevertheless, treatment and recovery caused him to miss the first eight weeks of the [[2008 PGA Tour]] season.  However, Immelman came back to win the [[2008 Masters Tournament]]. Despite scoring a double bogey on the 70th hole, the par 3 16th, Immelman finished with a score of 8 under par, beating favourite  [[Tiger Woods]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/sports/golf/14masters.html?ref=golf |title=Immelman Survives Pressure to Win Masters |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Larry |last=Dorman |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref> by three strokes.\n\nIn June 2009, Immelman announced he would withdraw from the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] due to [[tendonitis]] in his left wrist and elbow,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2009/06/14/usopenwds.html |title=Immelman withdraws from U.S. Open due to injury |publisher=PGA Tour |date=14 June 2009}}</ref> which plagued him for much of the 2009 and 2010 seasons.  As the 2013 [[PGA Tour]] neared its conclusion, Immelman's winless streak extended to five years; he was forced to play in the [[Web.com Tour Finals]] after he failed to make the [[FedEx Cup]] playoffs and his five-year exemption for winning the Masters expired. Immelman won the [[Hotel Fitness Championship]], the first of four [[Web.com Tour Finals]] tournaments, and finished the Finals in sixth place to regain his PGA Tour card for 2014.\n\nSince 2017, [[Turner Sports]] has utilized Immelman as an analyst for coverage of the [[PGA Championship]] on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]].\n\n2018 saw a resurgence in Immelman's career. Focusing on the European Tour, he made the cut in  8 out of 13 events, with a best finish of T3 at the [[Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open]]. In the event he had a chance to qualify for The Open Championship via the Open Qualifying Series, but missed an eight foot birdie putt on the last and lost out to [[Jens Dantorp]] by world rankings. However with the finish, Immelman moved from 1,380th in the world to 420th, his highest ranking since 2014. Immelman finished 77th on the [[Race to Dubai]] standings, regaining full status for the [[2019 European Tour|2019]] season.\n\n==Personal life==\nImmelman married his childhood sweetheart, Carminita, on 6 December 2003. He has frequently participated in his mentor [[Gary Player]]'s charity golf events around the world to help raise funds for children's causes. Immelman has a residence in [[Winter Park, Florida]] that he purchased in 2016 from former professional football player [[Jeff Faine]].<ref>{{cite news

He won his sole major championship at the [[2008 Masters Tournament]].\n\n==Early years==\nImmelman was born in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. Born into a golfing family. His father, Johan, is the former commissioner of the [[Sunshine Tour]] in South Africa, while his older brother [[Mark Immelman|Mark]] is a broadcaster, teaching pro and collegiate golf coach. Trevor took up golf at the age of five. He attended [[Hottentots Holland High School]]. He won the [[U.S. Amateur Public Links]] in 1998.\n\n==Professional career==\nImmelman turned professional in 1999. In 2000 he played mainly on the second tier professional tour in Europe, the [[Challenge Tour]], and finished tenth on the Order of Merit. He became a full member of the [[European Tour]] in 2001 and has made the top twenty of the Order of Merit three times. He has four wins on the European Tour, and in 2004 became the first man to successfully defend the [[South African Open (golf)|South African Open]] title since [[Gary Player]] in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2003 Immelman won the [[WGC-World Cup]] for South Africa in partnership with [[Rory Sabbatini]]. In 2005 he was a member of the losing International Team at the [[Presidents Cup]]. He has been playing with increasing frequency on the [[PGA Tour]] after receiving a 2-year PGA Tour exemption for 2006 and 2007 on account of this Presidents Cup appearance. In 2006 Immelman won his first PGA Tour event at the [[Cialis Western Open]], a result that moved him into the top 15 in the [[Official World Golf Rankings]]. He won the [[Sunshine Tour]] Order of Merit in 2002/03.\n\nImmelman withdrew from the 2006 [[Open Championship]] to be present for the birth of his first child. He finished 2006 in the top 10 of the PGA Tour money list and was named [[PGA Tour Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]]. In September 2007, Trevor Immelman was picked by [[Gary Player]] to participate in the 7th [[Presidents Cup]] held at the [[Royal Montreal Golf Club]], Canada. The International team lost 14.5 to the US team's 19.5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentscup.com/past-results.html |title=The Presidents Cup \u2013 Past Results |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202134720/http://www.presidentscup.com/past-results.html |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 13 December 2007, Immelman withdrew from the [[South African Open (golf)|South African Airways Open]] due to severe discomfort around his ribcage area and a problem breathing. He went into surgery the following Tuesday, 18 December 2007, and doctors discovered a [[lesion]] approximately the size of a golf ball on his [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. (Immelman remarked in an interview on the obvious irony of the size of the lesion).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/2007/r/players/12/18/immelman.surgery/index.html |publisher=PGA Tour |title=Immelman undergoes surgery to remove growth on his diaphragm |date=18 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220072620/http://www.pgatour.com/2007/r/players/12/18/immelman.surgery/index.html |archivedate=20 December 2007}}</ref> It was diagnosed as a calcified [[Fibrous connective tissue|fibrosis]] [[tumor]]. After more tests they discovered that it was [[Benign tumor|benign]].  Nevertheless, treatment and recovery caused him to miss the first eight weeks of the [[2008 PGA Tour]] season.  However, Immelman came back to win the [[2008 Masters Tournament]]. Despite scoring a double bogey on the 70th hole, the par 3 16th, Immelman finished with a score of 8 under par, beating favourite  [[Tiger Woods]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/sports/golf/14masters.html?ref=golf |title=Immelman Survives Pressure to Win Masters |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Larry |last=Dorman |date=14 April 2008 |accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref> by three strokes.\n\nIn June 2009, Immelman announced he would withdraw from the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] due to [[tendonitis]] in his left wrist and elbow,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/news/2009/06/14/usopenwds.html |title=Immelman withdraws from U.S. Open due to injury |publisher=PGA Tour |date=14 June 2009}}</ref> which plagued him for much of the 2009 and 2010 seasons.  As the 2013 [[PGA Tour]] neared its conclusion, Immelman's winless streak extended to five years; he was forced to play in the [[Web.com Tour Finals]] after he failed to make the [[FedEx Cup]] playoffs and his five-year exemption for winning the Masters expired. Immelman won the [[Hotel Fitness Championship]], the first of four [[Web.com Tour Finals]] tournaments, and finished the Finals in sixth place to regain his PGA Tour card for 2014.\n\nSince 2017, [[Turner Sports]] has utilized Immelman as an analyst for coverage of the [[PGA Championship]] on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]].\n\n2018 saw a resurgence in Immelman's career. Focusing on the European Tour, he made the cut in  8 out of 13 events, with a best finish of T3 at the [[Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open]]. In the event he had a chance to qualify for The Open Championship via the Open Qualifying Series, but missed an eight foot birdie putt on the last and lost out to [[Jens Dantorp]] by world rankings. However with the finish, Immelman moved from 1,380th in the world to 420th, his highest ranking since 2014. Immelman finished 77th on the [[Race to Dubai]] standings, regaining full status for the [[2019 European Tour|2019]] season.\n\n==Personal life==\nImmelman married his childhood sweetheart, Carminita, on 6 December 2003. He has frequently participated in his mentor [[Gary Player]]'s charity golf events around the world to help raise funds for children's causes. Immelman has a residence in [[Winter Park, Florida]] that he purchased in 2016 from former professional football player [[Jeff Faine]].<ref>{{cite news

Various educational institutions and civil associations were established through their support, two famous examples being, the [[University of Dacca]], the first University of East Bengal and [[Varendra Research Museum]] in Rajshahi, the first Museum of East Bengal. The families also produced [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Ministers]], [[Ambassadors]], [[Minister (government)|Ministers]], scholars, military officers and various other important figures. Members also received [[Knighthood]]s from the [[British India|British colonial government]] as well as other titles.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Murshid Quli Jafar Khan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Murshid Quli Khan]], the [[Nawab of Bengal]] under whom the Zamindars of Natore served.]]\n{{Main|Natore District#History}}\n[[Chalan Beel]], (a ''beel''  in Bengali denotes a large lake or marsh that fills up with water during the monsoons) was spread over a part of what is now [[Natore District]]. Legend has it that [[Raja]] (zamindar) [[Rajshahi Raj family|Ramjivan Ray]] was once travelling by boat searching for a suitable place to build his principal residence. While travelling through Chalan beel, he saw a snake that had caught a frog. Seeing this his learned ''pundits'' interpreted it as a sign that the end of his search had arrived and therefore told him that this should be the place of his residence. Whereupon the Raja called out to his boatmen: ''Nao Tharo'', ''nao'' meaning 'boat', and ''tharo'' meaning 'stop'in Hindustani. From a corruption of this exclamation, the place eventually came to be called 'Nator'.\n\nAt first Natore was a ''beel'' whose name was Chaivhanga. In 1706 Raja Ramjivan Ray established his capital here by filling the ''beel''. Natore was the headquarters of the district of [[Rajshahi]] from 1793 to 1825 during east India company's rule. In 1825 the headquarters were moved to Rajshahi and in 1829 Natore became a subdivision of [[Rajshahi district]]. In 1845 Natore Mahukuma was established. Natore town became a Municipality in 1869. More than a century later, in 1984, Natore subdivision was turned into a [[Districts of Bangladesh|district]] in independent Bangladesh.\n\n===Background===\n{{Main|East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950#History}}\nDuring the times of the [[medieval kingdoms of India]] rent was called ''rajasva'' (the King's share). The king's men used to collect rajasva from his subjects according to law, and none could be evicted if rajasva was paid regularly. Later, the Hindu 'rajasva' became 'jama' during Muslim rule of the [[Mughal Empire]]. However, the spirit of rajasva and jama remained the same. The cultivators had customary rights in land which the sovereign honoured, as long as they paid revenue to the rulers. These revenues were supplied to the ''[[zamindars]]'', officials of the empire, who created the [[Feudalism|feudalistic nobility]]. During the mughal era (specifically during the rule of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]), the [[Mansabdar]]i system, the military nobility evolved into the aristocratic landed zamindari system.\n\n===Roles===\n{{Further|Zamindar#Accession}}\nUnlike the autonomous or frontier chiefs, the hereditary status of the zamindar class was circumscribed by the [[Mughal emperors]], and the heir depended to a certain extent on the pleasure of the [[monarch|sovereign]]. Under the [[British Empire]], the zamindars were to be subordinate to the crown and not act as [[hereditary]] [[lord]]s, but at times family politics was at the heart of naming an heir. At times, a cousin could be named an heir with closer family relatives present even a lawfully wedded wife could inherit the zamindari if the ruling zamindar named her as an heir.\n\n==Families==\n\n===Maharajas of Natore and Rajshahi (North-western region)===\n{{Main|Rajshahi Raj family}}\n{{See also|Rani Bhabani}}\n[[File:Natore Rajbari1 (Palace).JPG|thumb|right|280px|The ornate [[Natore Palace]] of the [[Rajshahi Raj family|Ruling family of Rajshahi]] in Natore, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.]]\nMany old aristocrats and lords lost their estates during the rule of the Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]]. Besides, many zamindars lost their zamindari on account of their disobedience and rebellion. Murshid Quli Khan settled these zamindaries with his trusted followers.\nIn this process of replacement the most fortunate beneficiary was the Rajshahi zamindari. The family also benefited by another feature of nawab's revenue policy of encouragement to the formation of big zamindaries.\n\nThe [[Rajshahi Raj family]] traced its origin to Kamdev Rai, a [[tahsildar]] of the [[Puthia Raj family]]. Kamdev had three sons Ramjivan, Raghunandan and Bishnuram. Raghunandan was the very promising and enterprising. Raja Darpanarain, the [[zamindar]] of [[Puthia]], and Murshid Quli Khan had significant contributions behind Raghunandan's rise to prominence. Raghunandan sided with Murshid Quli Khan in his entanglement with the [[Subahdar]], the Prince [[Azim-us-Shan]], the grandson of Emperor Aurangzeb and thus won the confidence of the [[nawab]].\n\nAgain, when the diwani was transferred to [[Murshidabad]], he was appointed in a similar capacity as his master's representative there. During this time he came in close contact of Murshid Quli Khan and secured his confidence. Which is why the ''naib'' (later ruler of Bengal) trusted him and let him set up the dynasty. Just a few zamindars controlled half of the total landed property of Bengal and in 1793 British East India company has abolished Nizamat (local rule by nawabs appointed y the Mughal emperor) and has taken complete control of the province of Bengal. The colonial state viewed these princely zamindaris as potential threats to the security of the new state, because their power were so great that they could at any opportune moment combine and put the colonial state in great jeopardy. Hence it became a policy of the government to weaken these estates, if not destroy them altogether. One of the strategies to implement this design was the ruthless operation of the [[sunset law]] (law which required the lords to submit their revenues by sunset).\n\n===Rajas of Dighapatia (South-eastern region)===\n{{Main|Dighapatia Raj}}\n[[File:Uttara Gonovaban Natore.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The entrance of the [[Uttara Gano Bhaban|Grand Dighapatia Palace]].]]\nThe first Raja was Dayaram Roy<ref>{{cite book |last1=Banu |first1=U.

Raja Dayaram led the army of Raja Ramjivan in aid of the [[Nawab of Bengal]] in 1716 and overthrew the rebellious [[Raja Sitaram Ray]], who was a zamindar (and later king, or Raja) of neighbouring Bhusna state. The sack of Muhammadpur, Raja Sitaram's capital, later enabled him to ultimately lay the foundation of the Dighapatia dynasty. For his loyalty, he received large tracts of land in Rajshahi and [[Jessore District|Jessore]] as [[grant (money)|grants]] and later acquired zamindari in [[Bogra]] and [[Mymensingh]].\n\nNawab Murshid Quli Khan, who was the nawab of Bengal under Emperor Aurangzeb conferred on him the title of '[[Rai (Indian)|Rai-Raiyan]]' in recognition of his services. When [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|the Earl Cornwallis]] of East India company who were given the right to collect revenue from the province of Bengal, introduced the [[Permanent Settlement]] Act to increase revenue collection, a large number of the old [[feudal]] lords and zamindars created during the time of the Nawab Murshid Quli Khan could not meet land revenue standards and thus became defaulters. Their estates were sold up to a new class of wealthy lords. The Dighapatia Raj was one of the few remnants of the old decaying '[[jagir]]dars'. They were avidly following European dress, wine, [[horse race]] and various such other external glamour of life.\n\n===Rajas and Zamindars of Puthia (Western Region of Natore)===\n{{Main|Puthia Raj family}}\n[[File:Puthia Mandirs14.JPG|thumb|The [[Puthia Temple Complex#Bhubaneshwar Shiva Temple|Shiva Temple]] at [[Puthia Temple Complex|Puthia]]]]\nThe Puthia Raj family was created by the [[Mughal Emperors]] in the early seventeenth century is one of the oldest feudal estates of [[Bengal]]. A lord named Nilambar received the title of [[Raja]] (''King'') from the Emperor [[Jahangir]] (1605\u20131627 AD). In 1744, the region was divided between King Nilambar's sons and the Puthia Raj family was born. The family built lavish palaces and temples, such as the [[Puthia Temple Complex]] and were noted philanthropists. The Temple Complex consists of a cluster of notable old Hindu temples in [[Puthia Upazila]], [[Rajshahi Division]], Bangladesh. Located 23&nbsp;km to the east of [[Rajshahi]] city it has the largest number of Historic temples in Bangladesh. The temples have been built in terracotta in a variety of styles combining the typical Jor Bangla Architecture with other influences. The Rajbari or Palace of the Raja of Puthia is part of the complex.\n\nThe grandest temple in Puthia, the '''Govinda Temple''' was erected in mid-nineteenth century by the queen of Puthia. The temple is dedicated to Lord [[Krishna]], as the Puthians were converted to Vaishnavism by [[Radhamohana Thakura]]. The temple has exquisite terracotta ornamentation depicting the divine romance between Krishna and [[Radha]]. This temple, built in 1815 by the queen of Puthia and dedicated to the Hindu God [[Shiva]], is the largest Shiva temple in Bangladesh. The corridors have a touch of [[Jaipur]] architecture and in the [[sanctuary]], lies a very large black basalt Shiva Linga, one of the largest in the country.\n\n===Zamindars of Singra (North-eastern Region)===\n{{Main|Singranatore family}}\n[[File:IMG 1578.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Present-day Goleafroz College in the Singranatore Estate]]\nOne of the few Muslim [[zamindar]]s in the region, at a time when the territories were mainly ruled by the Hindu raj families (Royal families), the Singra Zamindari family or Singranatore Zamindars were descended from former [[mansabdar]]s as hereditary ''[[Mirza]]s''; a cadet branch of the [[Mughal Emperors|Imperial family]] of India, they descended from a [[Timurid Dynasty|perso-Turkic dynasty]]. It is a common misconception that the family gets the name from their estates and land holdings in the ''upazila'' of [[Singra Upazila|Singra]] of [[Natore]] district, while in reality, they are named after both ''upazilas'' of Singra and [[Natore Sadar Upazila|Natore]] of the district in [[Rajshahi division]].\n\nDuring the fall of the [[Rajshahi Raj family]], the clan gained considerable tracts of lands in their estates and functioned as [[vassal]] chiefs to the [[Dighapatia Raj|Maharajas of Dighapatia]]. Due to their religion, they were favoured by the Administration of Islamic [[East Pakistan]] (1948\u20131971) and then Bangladesh. They wielded significant influence in the area and founded education institutions such as [[Gole Afroz College]] and [[Rahmat Iqbal College]], as well as involvement in regional governance and politics.\n\n;Karchamaria, Singra\nOther zamindars in Singra included British-Indian aristocrat and historian, Sir [[Jadunath Sarkar]] who received the [[Order of the Indian Empire]] in 1929 from King [[George V]].\n\n===Nawabs of Bogra and Dhanbari===\n{{Main|Nawab Bahadur Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury|Muhammad Ali Bogra}}\n[[File:Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury.JPG|right|thumb|120px|[[Nawab Bahadur Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury|Nawab Ali Chowdhury]], the grandson of the Zamindar of Natore was influential in the development of East Bengal]]\nLocated beyond the Northern Frontiers of Natore, eminent aristocrats such as [[Nawab Bahadur Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury]], grandson of a Zamindar of Natore were credited with early development of the region. Nawab Ali Chowdhury had made a valuable contribution to the establishment of the [[University of Dhaka]] (1921). Dhaka University came into being under a central government Act and it was Nawab Ali, a key member of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], who piloted the Dhaka University Bill in the [[Imperial Legislative Assembly]]. After the establishment of the University he played important role in framing its rules and regulations and in sustaining the university when it faced financial and other difficulties during its formative period. Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury had been conferred upon with the titles of [[Khan Bahadur]] in 1906, [[Nawab]] in 1911, [[Order of the Indian Empire|Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire]] in 1918 and [[Nawab Bahadur Syed Nawab Ali Chowdhury|Nawab Bahadur]] in 1924 by the British Government. Nawab Ali's most famous grandson, the [[Nawabzada]], [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]] was [[Pakistan Ambassador to the United States]], [[Health Minister]], [[Finance Minister]], then [[Foreign Minister of Pakistan]], [[Defence Minister of Pakistan|Minister of Defence]] and finally the third [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. He was one of the core and principle [[:Category:Pakistan Movement|Founding Fathers]] of current and modern state of Pakistan, responsible for leading the Muslim League in East Pakistan, in charge of party's foreign directorate.\n\n==Legacy==\nBesides continued regional governance and economic development, the zamindars of natore started major works that were monumental for Bengal. Excavation of [[Somapura Mahavihara]], the 1985 [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] was started by societies and institutions founded by the Zamindars. The [[University of Dhaka|oldest multi-disciplinary research university]] where [[Satyendranath Bose]] published his works defining the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] with [[Albert Einstein]] was also one such institute which survives till this day.\n\n==Abolition==\n{{Main|East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950}}\nThe [[East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950]] was drafted on 31 March 1948 during the after the fall of the [[British Raj|British Monarchy]] in India, and passed on 16 May 1951. Before passage of the legislature, landed revenue laws of Bengal consisted of the [[Permanent Settlement]] of 1793 and the ''Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885''.\n\nThe 1793 legislature created a landed aristocracy which was supposed to be loyal to the [[British Empire]]. The Act of 1885 defined the rights and liabilities of the ''[[Ryot|ryats]]'' ([[Peasants]]) in relation to their superior ''lords'' ([[Zamindar]]s). After the British left in 1947, the law abolished the Zamindari system in the region, after which the lands of the state were under the federal government. It was seen as a democratic move to a ''people's state'' rather than a [[Indian feudalism|feudal class system]].\n\nIn consequence of introduction of the law, no intermediary interest were present between the Government and its people, the government has become the only lord and the cultivators were relieved of the baneful effect of subinfeudation. The zamindari families were partly reimbursed for their losses during the exchange of land ownership after a few battles in court. The rule of zamindars were substituted by a hierarchy of officials with the Board of Land Administration with Assistant commissioners, collectors and Deputy Commissioner etc. A collector or deputy commissioner is assisted by one additional deputy commissioner for revenue, one revenue deputy collector, and a number of other governmental officials.\n\n==Notes and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Hussain| first1 = Akmal\n  | title = History of Bangladesh, 1704\u20131971\n  | volume = 2\n  | location = Bangladesh\n  | publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]\n  | year= 1997\n  | pages = 55,199\n  | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_Bangladesh_1704_1971.html?id=53ZuAAAAMAAJ\n  | isbn = 978-9845123372}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = McDermott| first1 = Rachel F.\n  | title = Mother of My Heart, Daughter of My Dreams: Kali And Uma In The Devotional Poetry Of Bengal\n  | location = England\n  | publisher=Oxford University Press\n  | year= 1997\n  | pages = 19\n  | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mother_of_my_heart_daughter_of_my_dreams.html?id=2PrChFaXgf0C\n  | isbn = 978-0195134353}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Ray| first1 = Ratnalekha\n  | title = Change in Bengal agrarian society, c. 1760\u20131850\n  | location = India\n  | publisher = Manohar\n  | year= 1979\n  | pages = 26\n  | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Change_in_Bengal_agrarian_society_c1760.html?id=lJouAAAAMAAJ\n  }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dighapatia_Raj Dighapatia Royal Family] Article on the Ruling Family from [[Banglapedia]]\n* [http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rajshahi_Raj Page on ''Rajshahi Raj family''- Also known as the Natore Raj] on [[Banglapedia]]\n\n{{Bengal Zamindars}}\n\n[[Category:History of Bengal]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Natore Dighapatia Raja's (King) Monogram.JPG|right|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Dighapatia Raj|Maharaja (Zamindar) of Dighapatia]] in [[Natore]].]]\n'''Zamindars of Natore''' were influential [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[Zamindars of Bengal|Bengali Zamindars]] (rent-receiving landholders), who owned large estates in what is today [[Natore District]] in Bangladesh.\n\nThey contributed to the development of [[East Bengal]] and later Bangladesh through philanthropy and patronage. Various educational institutions and civil associations were established through their support, two famous examples being, the [[University of Dacca]], the first University of East Bengal and [[Varendra Research Museum]] in Rajshahi, the first Museum of East Bengal. The families also produced [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Ministers]], [[Ambassadors]], [[Minister (government)|Ministers]], scholars, military officers and various other important figures. Members also received [[Knighthood]]s from the [[British India|British colonial government]] as well as other titles.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Murshid Quli Jafar Khan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Murshid Quli Khan]], the [[Nawab of Bengal]] under whom the Zamindars of Natore served.]]\n{{Main|Natore District#History}}\n[[Chalan Beel]], (a ''beel''  in Bengali denotes a large lake or marsh that fills up with water during the monsoons) was spread over a part of what is now [[Natore District]]. Legend has it that [[Raja]] (zamindar) [[Rajshahi Raj family|Ramjivan Ray]] was once travelling by boat searching for a suitable place to build his principal residence. While travelling through Chalan beel, he saw a snake that had caught a frog. Seeing this his learned ''pundits'' interpreted it as a sign that the end of his search had arrived and therefore told him that this should be the place of his residence. Whereupon the Raja called out to his boatmen: ''Nao Tharo'', ''nao'' meaning 'boat', and ''tharo'' meaning 'stop'in Hindustani. From a corruption of this exclamation, the place eventually came to be called 'Nator'.\n\nAt first Natore was a ''beel'' whose name was Chaivhanga. In 1706 Raja Ramjivan Ray established his capital here by filling the ''beel''. Natore was the headquarters of the district of [[Rajshahi]] from 1793 to 1825 during east India company's rule. In 1825 the headquarters were moved to Rajshahi and in 1829 Natore became a subdivision of [[Rajshahi district]]. In 1845 Natore Mahukuma was established. Natore town became a Municipality in 1869. More than a century later, in 1984, Natore subdivision was turned into a [[Districts of Bangladesh|district]] in independent Bangladesh.\n\n===Background===\n{{Main|East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950#History}}\nDuring the times of the [[medieval kingdoms of India]] rent was called ''rajasva'' (the King's share). The king's men used to collect rajasva from his subjects according to law, and none could be evicted if rajasva was paid regularly. Later, the Hindu 'rajasva' became 'jama' during Muslim rule of the [[Mughal Empire]]. However, the spirit of rajasva and jama remained the same. The cultivators had customary rights in land which the sovereign honoured, as long as they paid revenue to the rulers. These revenues were supplied to the ''[[zamindars]]'', officials of the empire, who created the [[Feudalism|feudalistic nobility]]. During the mughal era (specifically during the rule of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]), the [[Mansabdar]]i system, the military nobility evolved into the aristocratic landed zamindari system.\n\n===Roles===\n{{Further|Zamindar#Accession}}\nUnlike the autonomous or frontier chiefs, the hereditary status of the zamindar class was circumscribed by the [[Mughal emperors]], and the heir depended to a certain extent on the pleasure of the [[monarch|sovereign]]. Under the [[British Empire]], the zamindars were to be subordinate to the crown and not act as [[hereditary]] [[lord]]s, but at times family politics was at the heart of naming an heir. At times, a cousin could be named an heir with closer family relatives present even a lawfully wedded wife could inherit the zamindari if the ruling zamindar named her as an heir.\n\n==Families==\n\n===Maharajas of Natore and Rajshahi (North-western region)===\n{{Main|Rajshahi Raj family}}\n{{See also|Rani Bhabani}}\n[[File:Natore Rajbari1 (Palace).JPG|thumb|right|280px|The ornate [[Natore Palace]] of the [[Rajshahi Raj family|Ruling family of Rajshahi]] in Natore, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.]]\nMany old aristocrats and lords lost their estates during the rule of the Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]]. Besides, many zamindars lost their zamindari on account of their disobedience and rebellion. Murshid Quli Khan settled these zamindaries with his trusted followers.\nIn this process of replacement the most fortunate beneficiary was the Rajshahi zamindari. The family also benefited by another feature of nawab's revenue policy of encouragement to the formation of big zamindaries.\n\nThe [[Rajshahi Raj family]] traced its origin to Kamdev Rai, a [[tahsildar]] of the [[Puthia Raj family]]. Kamdev had three sons Ramjivan, Raghunandan and Bishnuram. Raghunandan was the very promising and enterprising. Raja Darpanarain, the [[zamindar]] of [[Puthia]], and Murshid Quli Khan had significant contributions behind Raghunandan's rise to prominence. Raghunandan sided with Murshid Quli Khan in his entanglement with the [[Subahdar]], the Prince [[Azim-us-Shan]], the grandson of Emperor Aurangzeb and thus won the confidence of the [[nawab]].\n\nAgain, when the diwani was transferred to [[Murshidabad]], he was appointed in a similar capacity as his master's representative there. During this time he came in close contact of Murshid Quli Khan and secured his confidence. Which is why the ''naib'' (later ruler of Bengal) trusted him and let him set up the dynasty. Just a few zamindars controlled half of the total landed property of Bengal and in 1793 British East India company has abolished Nizamat (local rule by nawabs appointed y the Mughal emperor) and has taken complete control of the province of Bengal. The colonial state viewed these princely zamindaris as potential threats to the security of the new state, because their power were so great that they could at any opportune moment combine and put the colonial state in great jeopardy. Hence it became a policy of the government to weaken these estates, if not destroy them altogether. One of the strategies to implement this design was the ruthless operation of the [[sunset law]] (law which required the lords to submit their revenues by sunset).\n\n===Rajas of Dighapatia (South-eastern region)===\n{{Main|Dighapatia Raj}}\n[[File:Uttara Gonovaban Natore.jpg|left|thumb|280px|The entrance of the [[Uttara Gano Bhaban|Grand Dighapatia Palace]].]]\nThe first Raja was Dayaram Roy<ref>{{cite book |last1=Banu |first1=U.

Raja Dayaram led the army of Raja Ramjivan in aid of the [[Nawab of Bengal]] in 1716 and overthrew the rebellious [[Raja Sitaram Ray]], who was a zamindar (and later king, or Raja) of neighbouring Bhusna state. The sack of Muhammadpur, Raja Sitaram's capital, later enabled him to ultimately lay the foundation of the Dighapatia dynasty. For his loyalty, he received large tracts of land in Rajshahi and [[Jessore District|Jessore]] as [[grant (money)|grants]] and later acquired zamindari in [[Bogra]] and [[Mymensingh]].\n\nNawab Murshid Quli Khan, who was the nawab of Bengal under Emperor Aurangzeb conferred on him the title of '[[Rai (Indian)|Rai-Raiyan]]' in recognition of his services. When [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|the Earl Cornwallis]] of East India company who were given the right to collect revenue from the province of Bengal, introduced the [[Permanent Settlement]] Act to increase revenue collection, a large number of the old [[feudal]] lords and zamindars created during the time of the Nawab Murshid Quli Khan could not meet land revenue standards and thus became defaulters. Their estates were sold up to a new class of wealthy lords. The Dighapatia Raj was one of the few remnants of the old decaying '[[jagir]]dars'. They were avidly following European dress, wine, [[horse race]] and various such other external glamour of life.\n\n===Rajas and Zamindars of Puthia (Western Region of Natore)===\n{{Main|Puthia Raj family}}\n[[File:Puthia Mandirs14.JPG|thumb|The [[Puthia Temple Complex#Bhubaneshwar Shiva Temple|Shiva Temple]] at [[Puthia Temple Complex|Puthia]]]]\nThe Puthia Raj family was created by the [[Mughal Emperors]] in the early seventeenth century is one of the oldest feudal estates of [[Bengal]]. A lord named Nilambar received the title of [[Raja]] (''King'') from the Emperor [[Jahangir]] (1605\u20131627 AD). In 1744, the region was divided between King Nilambar's sons and the Puthia Raj family was born. The family built lavish palaces and temples, such as the [[Puthia Temple Complex]] and were noted philanthropists. The Temple Complex consists of a cluster of notable old Hindu temples in [[Puthia Upazila]], [[Rajshahi Division]], Bangladesh. Located 23&nbsp;km to the east of [[Rajshahi]] city it has the largest number of Historic temples in Bangladesh. The temples have been built in terracotta in a variety of styles combining the typical Jor Bangla Architecture with other influences. The Rajbari or Palace of the Raja of Puthia is part of the complex.\n\nThe grandest temple in Puthia, the '''Govinda Temple''' was erected in mid-nineteenth century by the queen of Puthia. The temple is dedicated to Lord [[Krishna]], as the Puthians were converted to Vaishnavism by [[Radhamohana Thakura]]. The temple has exquisite terracotta ornamentation depicting the divine romance between Krishna and [[Radha]]. This temple, built in 1815 by the queen of Puthia and dedicated to the Hindu God [[Shiva]], is the largest Shiva temple in Bangladesh. The corridors have a touch of [[Jaipur]] architecture and in the [[sanctuary]], lies a very large black basalt Shiva Linga, one of the largest in the country.\n\n===Zamindars of Singra (North-eastern Region)===\n{{Main|Singranatore Family}}\n[[File:IMG 1578.jpg|left|thumb|280px|Present-day Goleafroz College in the Singranatore Estate]]\nOne of the few Muslim [[zamindar]]s in the region, at a time when the territories were mainly ruled by the Hindu raj families (Royal families), the Singra Zamindari family or Singranatore Zamindars were descended from former [[mansabdar]]s as hereditary ''[[Mirza]]s''; a cadet branch of the [[Mughal Emperors|Imperial family]] of India, they descended from a [[Timurid Dynasty|perso-Turkic dynasty]].
