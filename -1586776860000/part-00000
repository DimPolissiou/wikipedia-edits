Apel's father was a mechanical engineer: his mother worked in the garments industry. He attended school in nearby [[Sonneberg]] and [[Steinach, Thuringia|Steinach]], but left school in 1932 in order to embark on an apprenticeship at the [[Neuhaus am Rennweg|Neuhaus]] [[:de:Porzellanfabrik Moschendorf|porcellain factory]] in toolmaking and mechanical engineering. The ruling [[Nazi Party]] was popular in the region and in 1935 he joined the [[Deutsches Jungvolk]] youth organisation. However, it was found that the sixteen year old disrupted the \"mind-numbingly dull drill exercises\" (\"{{Lang|de|der stumpfsinnige Drill}}\"), and he was thrown out after nine months because of his \"negative attitude\" to the quasi-military exercises in which the boys were expected to participate.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\" /> After completing his apprenticeship in 1935 he stayed on at the Neuhaus factory as a toolmaker and designer till 1937.<ref name=EAlautwww /> Then, between 1937 and 1939, he attended the [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau|Engineering Academy]] at nearby [[Ilmenau]], emerging with a degree in mechanical engineering.<ref name=EAlautMunzinger/><ref name=\"EikBehling2017\">{{cite book|author2=[[:de:Jan Eik|Jan Eik]] (co-author)|author1=Klaus Behling (author)|title=Letzter Auszweg Makarow:  Der Tod Erich Apels am 3.

Around this time [[World War II]] [[Invasion of Poland|broke out]]. However, on 20 December 1939 Apel was ordered to the [[Waffenamt|Weapons Agency's]] [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|research facility]] at [[Peenem\u00fcnde]] on Germany's northern coast. The head of the facility was the charismatic rocketry expert, [[Wernher von Braun]]. Apel seems to have been in his element. A contemporary later recalled that he worked from 07.30 till 17.30, like everyone else, but then in the evenings he retreated to his bedroom in a nearby hostel, in order to work on proposals for improvements. His speciality was the hydraulic systems for the rockets. He was tireless in his work of calculation, measuring and modelling.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\" /> He seems to have made a good impression, since in August 1940 he was relieved of all further obligations regarding military service. In November 1940 he was appointed to the position of plant engineer and assistant to the facility director.<ref name=EAlautwww /> He was totally uninterested in politics, never joining the [[Nazi Party|party]], and regarded by colleagues as a dedicated engineer, body and soul.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\n3 October 1942 was Apel's twenty-fifth birthday. Coincidentally, he was able to spent the day as a witness to the first launch anywhere in the world of a long-distance [[rocket]], the so-called (at this stage) [[V-2 rocket|A4]].  The launch took place at 16.00 and everything worked perfectly, the rocket attaining a speed of Mach 4.5, a height of {{convert|85|km}}, and a horizontal distance of {{convert|190|km}}.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  At the start of 1943 Apel was promoted again, despite his young age becoming head of one of the many development departments at the Peenem\u00fcnde army research facility.<ref name=EAlautwww/>  Shortly after this he mentioned to as group of colleagues what a wretched business it was that the thing should explode in the middle of a city.  His boss, [[Walter Thiel]], came to hear of the comment and called him aside, \"Apel, you should have joined the medical service: you're too soft for the work here\".  However, there is no indication that Apel's comment adversely affected his career prospects:  the researchers at Peenem\u00fcnde saw themselves as an elite team engaged in vital work, and the only realistic alternative career path would have led him back to the military frontline.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nDuring 1943 it became clear that the British knew about the research facility at Peenem\u00fcnde.  With their US allies they launched a [[Bombing of Peenem\u00fcnde in World War II|succession of bombing raids]] to destroy it, starting in August 1943.  Most of the 733 people killed at Peenem\u00fcnde in the first bombing raid, on 17 August, were [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]], but the dead also included Erich Apel's boss, [[Walter Thiel]] and his family.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  By that time, however, Apel himself was far away, transferred in April 1943 with his own team of assembly specialists and administrators to the [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch|Linke-Hofmann-Werke (LHW)]] plant in [[Breslau| Breslau (as Wroc\u0142aw was known]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|before 1945)]].<ref name=EAlautwww/><ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  Breslau was traditionally a centre for railway production and LHW was traditionally a manufacturer of railway locomotives and rolling stock, but during the war its sophisticated engineering capabilities were also being adapted to produce components and sub-assemblies for the [[V-2 rocket|rocket]], which government propaganda was by now identifying as the \"Vergeltungswaffe 2\" (''\"Retribution weapon 2\"'' / V-2).<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  As the continuing bombing raids at the [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center]] had their effect through 1943 and 1944, the LHW plant became the assembly location for the [[V-2 rocket]]s.  In 1 April 1944, at the request of the LHW management, Erich Apel was released from his employment contract with the [[Waffenamt|Army High Command Weapons Agency]].  He was now employed directly as Chief Engineer and Assistant to the Technical Director at LHW.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1944 [[Red army|the war]] was [[Siege of Breslau|coming home to Germany]].  LHW now outsourced [[V-2 rocket]] production to a firm called \"Peterbau GmbH\" in [[Kleinbodungen]] near [[Nordhausen]].  With the assembly contract they sent Erich Apel, who with effect from January 1945 became Technical Director of Peterbau GmbH.  Apel's resolute determination to avoid politics now seemed to catch up with him, since the new location for rocket assembly was part of the vast underground factory at the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]].  Conditions were so dreadful that at least one commentator has suggested that the [[V-2 rocket]]s found more victims among the slave labourers engaged in constructing the underground factory and in working on the rockets than among the citizens of [[London]], the intended target of the finished rockets.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  Even if Erich Apel had nothing to do with setting up and running the vast deadly [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour infrastructure]], as the engineer responsible for the rockets he was naturally associated with it.  As [[Nazi Germany]] collapsed militarily and politically during the first part of 1945, Apel succeeded in getting back to his home village of [[Judenbach]].  Like millions of his compatriots he was determined to make a clean break with the past.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\n=== Soviet occupation zone ===\n[[End of World War II in Europe|War ended]], formally, in May 1945.  The entire southern region of Germany had been liberated by the [[United States Army]], but the [[Allies of World War II|victorious powers]] had [[Yalta conference|already agreed]] a partition of the western two thirds of [[Nazi Germany|the country]] into four military occupation zones.  After the Americans had withdrawn to their agreed positions [[Judenbach]] was included in the middle portion of Germany that would now be administered as the [[Soviet occupation zone]].  Initially Apel worked on the local farms.  On 15 January 1946 he enrolled on the [[:de:Neulehrer|\"New Teachers\"]] programme.  With millions of working age Germans dead or in prison of war camps, there was a desperate shortage of teachers, and the scheme, implemented with varying levels of effectiveness in the various occupation zones, was designed to select those appropriately educated individuals who were thought to be not excessively tainted by Nazi involvement, to undergo a rapid \"re-education\" and set to work educating school-age children.  At the same time he both studied and taught, till 31 May 1946, at the Professional Business Academy in nearby [[Steinach, Thuringia|Steinach]].<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nIn January 1946 Erich Apel joined a political party, choosing the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (''\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / SPD)]].  Four months later, the SPD [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|merged]] with the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] to form the new [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\"'' / SED)]].  The merger was presented as a way to prevent divisions on the political left from opening up opportunities for right wing populists to [[Machtergreifung|take control]] as had happened after [[November 1932 German federal election|1932]].  In reality it never took effect except in the Soviet zone, where it received sustained practical backing from the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|military administration]].  The political development was not one for which Apel could muster much enthusiasm, and in common with many [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] members he was not one of those \"volunteering\" to sign his party membership over to the new party<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/> (though he was accepted as a member of the SED, eleven years later, in 1957<ref name=EAlautwww/>).\n\n=== An island in the middle of a lake west of Moscow ===\n\nOn 1 June 1946 Apel was \"picked up\" by the Soviet authorities.  They showed no interest in his association with [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] at the underground rocket factory at [[Mittelbau-Dora]].  But they were nevertheless interested in the factory; and they did make him an offer which, for a range of practical reasons, he was almost certainly in no position to refuse.  The Soviets invited him to work with them as chief engineer and representative of the (former) factory management at the Soviet Technical Commission in the [[Bleicherode]] quarter of Nordhausen (which had also ended up in the Soviet zone), adjacent to the vast underground rocket plant.<ref name=EAlautwww/><ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nSoviet interest in the German rocket programme was fully shared by the United States.  During the chaotic closing weeks of the war [[Wernher von Braun]] had traveled to [[Nordhausen]] and met with Apel, offering to take him to America after the military defeat which by now everyone saw as inevitable.  Von Braun was keen, as far as possible, to keep his full team with him.  But his specialist in rocket hydraulics turned him down.  Apel did not want to volunteer for further work in the weapons industry.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nOn 22 October 1946, across the [[Soviet occupation zone]], in the early hours of the morning technicians and engineers from the rocket project were visited by Soviet officers, each accompanied by a translator.  A brief instruction was read out:  \"By order of the Soviet Military Administration you must work for five years in the Soviet Union.  You can take your wife and family with you, and as many of your personal effects as you wish ...\".  Till now Apel's working life had involved living in guest houses or barracks so he did not have many personal effects.  Just hours after the order was given Apel and his colleagues were on the train heading east as part of [[Operation Osoaviakhim]].  The mood on the train was dark and apprehensive.  The journey took around 14 days.  Their ultimate destination was an island in the middle of [[Lake Seliger]] in a sparsely inhabited marshy region some {{convert|400|km}} northwest of [[Moscow]].<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nBefore crossing to the island Apel was taken to [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast|Podlipki (today Korolyov)]] where he was reunited with a large quantity of heavy machinery and equipment that he had last seen in Germany during the closing weeks of the war.  [[Operation Barbarossa|The German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941 had forced the Soviets to build up an impressive expertise in deconstructing factories and their equipment, crating them up, and relocating them by train to places beyond the reach of the [[Wehrmacht|German army]].  After the war they had taken the opportunity to perfect their skills, crating up surviving German factories and their equipment, and taking them to the Soviet Union by way of war reparations.  The 1937 [[Opel Kadett]] turned up in 1947 as the Soviet built [[Moskvitch 400-420|Moskvitch 400]].  They had also applied their skill to the rocket facility in the mountain.  The [[Red army]] had used 717 railway wagons to carry away 5,647 tonnes of machinery, munitions, and partially constructed rockets.  By the end of 1946 a further 2,270 railway wagons had transported another 14,256 rocket construction plant, partially constructed rockets, and specialist machinery from the former Nazi facility in the Soviet occupation zone to a new rocket research facility in the Soviet Union.  Secrecy was so complete that ten years later the world still believed that Soviet rocket programme was based on Soviet rocket science. The Americans had taken away only 400 tonnes of \"rocket materials\" from he Nordhausen facility.  After inspecting the Soviet hoard, Erich Apel joined his colleagues on the [[Gorodomlya Island|Island of Gorodomlya]].<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/><ref name=\"EAlautJA\">{{cite web|url= http://www.storyal.de/Story-2015/Erich-Apel.html|title=Erich Apel  ....  Wer war Erich Apel?|author=Prof. Dr.-Ing. J\u00fcrgen Albrecht (compiler-publisher)|date= 3 December 2015|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nKeeping the German workers on an island helped enforce the secrecy, but the German experts nevertheless received wages twice as high as those of their Soviet counterparts.  Erich Apel became head of a testing department.  Seventy years later a colleague from those times remembered him as \"sociable, but also a little distant.  Not so proletarian, and always a bit 'the boss'\" (''\"\"Er war gesellig, aber auch ein bisschen distanziert.  Nicht so proletenhaft, immer auch ein bisschen 'Der Chef'\"'').  There was no attempt to integrate the Germans into the Soviet research teams.  Stalin never intended that they should remain permanently.  The idea was to \"milk\" their knowledge till their Soviet counterparts had absorbed all the necessary knowledge.  That point was reached by the end of 1948, after which the Germans on the island were restricted to \"theoretical\" research.  That suited Apel well enough.  He had found a new wife, Christa, the daughter of a German aircraft engineer from the [[:de:Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado aircraft plant]].  Information on his first marriage remains in short supply:  Christa Apel said later that she believed Erich had married an Austrian woman around 1942, but the first marriage had ended in divorce because Apel's war work meant he was almost always away.  It was frequently indicated that during his six years in the Soviet Union Erich Apel became a communist, but in his bones it seems reasonable to conclude that he remained a political agnostic.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\n=== German Democratic Republic ===\nErich Apel returned on 2 June 1952.  The [[Soviet occupation zone]] had been relaunched in October 1949 as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]], seen by many - especially in the west - as a new kind of [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]].  There was no call, in East Germany, for specialist expertise in weapons and rocketry.  Other branches of heavy industry remained in place, however.  Just four months after getting back, Erich Apel was working as a Chief Engineer and Department Head at the East German Ministry for Machinery Construction.  Promotion to a Technical Directorship followed in April 1953.  In November 1953 he became a deputy minister in the department,<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/><ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 20 March 1958.</ref> working under [[Heinrich Rau]].<ref name=EAlautJA/>\n\nHe owed his rapid advancement in the new state to its leader, [[Walter Ulbricht]].  After years under military occupation which in many ways placed Soviet well-being ahead of German reconstruction, Ulbricht had narrowly survived the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953 Uprising]] and was now keen to demonstrate that under Soviet sponsorship it was possible to create in East Germany a fully functioning socialist state.  For that he needed technical experts and talented administrators.  Apel was both.  An important political ally and sponsor was [[:de:Fritz Selbmann|Fritz Selbmann]].  After his six years in the Soviet Union, Apel (like Selbmann), was a convinced proponent of a \"[[Planned economy]]\".  The choice was one between \"Rationalty\" (''Vernunft'') and \"Chaos\".  It was already apparent that in West Germany free market capitalism was giving rise to far more rapid economic growth than anything happening in East Germany.  The lesson to be drawn was that economic planning had to be undertaken competently and in microscopic detail by the government.  Political leadership was needed.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nIn June 1954, already a junior government minister, Apel became a candidate for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership.  Membership was granted in March 1957.<ref name=EAlautwww/>  Slightly more than one year later, in July 1958, he became a candidate for Central Committee membership.<ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 17. July 1958</ref>  In July 1960 Erich Apel became one of approximately 112 members of the powerful [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Party Central Committee]].<ref name=EAlautwww/><ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 24 July 1960</ref>  Under the Leninist constitutional structure in place, the Central Committee exercised a far tighter degree of control than government ministers or the [[Volkskammer|National Parliament (''Volkskammer'')]].  It was therefore by most reckoning a promotion when on 6 February 1958 Erich Apel resigned his ministerial position and accepted a position as head of the newly created Economic Commission of the Central Committee's Politburo.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  In 1958 he also became a member of the [[Volkskammer]], in which capacity he chaired the Parliamentary Economic Committee.<ref name=EAlautwww/>\n\nThe economic challenges facing East Germany were already formidable by 1960.  The mandate Walter Ulbricht gave to the new Economic Commission was summed up in the mantra which the leader liked to repeat.  East Germany should \"overtake without catching up\" (''\"\u00fcberholen ohne einzuholen\"'').  East Germans must be able to eat more butter and meat than West Germans. One day they must be able to travel in faster cars and live in better apartments.  This must be accomplished without having to copy \"capitalist production methods\".  Erich Apel must make it happen, not \"someday ... never\", but by creating and following a plan.  If it was a dream, it was a dream in which many comrades evidently believed.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  In July 1961 Apel was promoted to candidate membership of the politburo and secretaryship of the Central Committee.<ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 5 July 1961.</ref>  There were other appointments which combined to stress his importance in the wider government project.  In 1960 he received a doctorate in return for a dissertation on the so-called East German Chemistry Programme.<ref name=EAlautwww/>\n\nThe \"Chemistry Programme\" was a seven-year plan, launched in 1958 under the widely communicated motto \"Chemistry gives us bread, welfare and beauty\" (''\"Chemie gibt Brot, Wohlstand und Sch\u00f6nheit\"''), and designed to double chemicals production by 1965, making it the country's second largest industrial sector after mechanical engineering.  The project was closely identified with Erich Apel, whose intellectual brilliance marked him, and the project, out for success.  But reality got in the way of the targets.  Reparations extracted by the Soviets had bled the country of its capacity to rebuild and maintain the infrastructure necessary to support the East German government's economic aspirations.  Cut off by international political rivalries from western and world markets, the nation continued to be dependent on deliveries of vital raw materials from the [[Soviet Union]], and the partnership with the Soviets, even at the height of the [[Cold War]], was far less fraternal than would have been assumed at the time in the west.  Recently discovered documents indicate that even in 1959 Moscow agreed to deliver to the German Democratic Republic only around half the raw materials which the East German economic plan for 1960-62 called for.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  One solution was to try and select trading partners according to commercial criteria and not purely according to political dogma.  The economic blockade dividing East Germany from the west was largely self-imposed: between 1962 and 1965 Apel was able to oversee a modest trend whereby the proportion of East Germany's foreign trade with west rose from 21% to 25% of the total.  But more than half of the country's trade was reported in 1965 to be with the Soviet Union, conducted on terms favourable to Moscow and disadvantageous to East Germany, applying set prices that were well below \"world market prices\", both for exports and for imports.<ref name=EAlautSpiegel511965/>\n\nIn 1964 [[Otto Grotewohl]] and [[Willi Stoph]] took over as Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of East Germany]]<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/> Council of Ministers]].  At the time there were some who saw Stoph as Walter Ulbricht's heir apparent.  A level of rivalry within the Party Central Committee was normal, but between Apel and Stoph there quickly emerged a particularly intense mutual antagonism.  To the extent that both men were responsible for delivering a better future for the people there was an inherent overlap between their public profiles.  Stoph never missed a chance to highlight a failure to meet planned objectives or to criticise Apel's actions and utterances.  Pressure also increased from Moscow where [[Nikita Khrushchev]] fell from power in October 1964.  [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the new party secretary in Moscow, condemned his predecessor's \"failures of economic leadership\".  There were a number of rapid practical changes.  Soviet wheat deliveries to East Germany planned for 1966 were cut back to 400,000 tonnes, a third of the annual quantity in existing plans.  Within the East German leadership Apel had always been able to count on backing for his reforms from Walter Ulbricht, but the changes in Moscow meant that Ulbricht's driving priority had was now to secure his own position.<ref name=EAlautWST/>  Back in January 1963 Ulbricht had stunned colleagues, under the influence of Apel, announcing a 180-degree reversal on economic policy.  \"We need economics to trump politics\" ('' \"Wir brauchen ein Primat der \u00d6konomie \u00fcber die Politik!\"'').<ref name=EAlautGD/>  There was talk of revitalising the market and allowing private trade - subject to a restrictive framework - and of moving society away from a semi-military footing towards a civil one.<ref name=EAlautGD/>  That had been in 1963, before the fall of Khrushchev.  But now the leader was ready for another 180 degree reversal over economic policy.<ref name=\"Baylis1974\">{{cite book|author=Thomas A.

Apel's father was a mechanical engineer: his mother worked in the garments industry. He attended school in nearby [[Sonneberg]] and [[Steinach, Thuringia|Steinach]], but left school in 1932 in order to embark on an apprenticeship at the [[Neuhaus am Rennweg|Neuhaus]] [[:de:Porzellanfabrik Moschendorf|porcellain factory]] in toolmaking and mechanical engineering. The ruling [[Nazi Party]] was popular in the region and in 1935 he joined the [[Deutsches Jungvolk]] youth organisation. However, it was found that the sixteen year old disrupted the \"mind-numbingly dull drill exercises\" (\"{{Lang|de|der stumpfsinnige Drill}}\"), and he was thrown out after nine months because of his \"negative attitude\" to the quasi-military exercises in which the boys were expected to participate.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\" /> After completing his apprenticeship in 1935 he stayed on at the Neuhaus factory as a toolmaker and designer till 1937.<ref name=EAlautwww /> Then, between 1937 and 1939, he attended the [[Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau|Engineering Academy]] at nearby [[Ilmenau]], emerging with a degree in mechanical engineering.<ref name=EAlautMunzinger/><ref name=\"EikBehling2017\">{{cite book|author2=[[:de:Jan Eik|Jan Eik]] (co-author)|author1=Klaus Behling (author)|title=Letzter Auszweg Makarow:  Der Tod Erich Apels am 3.

Around this time [[World War II]] [[Invasion of Poland|broke out]]. However, on 20 December 1939 Apel was ordered to the [[Waffenamt|Weapons Agency's]] [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|research facility]] at [[Peenem\u00fcnde]] on Germany's northern coast. The head of the facility was the charismatic rocketry expert, [[Wernher von Braun]]. Apel seems to have been in his element. A contemporary later recalled that he worked from 07.30 till 17.30, like everyone else, but then in the evenings he retreated to his bedroom in a nearby hostel, in order to work on proposals for improvements. His speciality was the hydraulic systems for the rockets. He was tireless in his work of calculation, measuring and modelling.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\" /> He seems to have made a good impression, since in August 1940 he was relieved of all further obligations regarding military service. In November 1940 he was appointed to the position of plant engineer and assistant to the facility director.<ref name=EAlautwww /> He was totally uninterested in politics, never joining the [[Nazi Party|party]], and regarded by colleagues as a dedicated engineer, body and soul.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\n3 October 1942 was Apel's twenty-fifth birthday. Coincidentally, he was able to spent the day as a witness to the first launch anywhere in the world of a long-distance [[rocket]], the so-called (at this stage) [[V-2 rocket|A4]].  The launch took place at 16.00 and everything worked perfectly, the rocket attaining a speed of Mach 4.5, a height of {{convert|85|km}}, and a horizontal distance of {{convert|190|km}}.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  At the start of 1943 Apel was promoted again, despite his young age becoming head of one of the many development departments at the Peenem\u00fcnde army research facility.<ref name=EAlautwww/>  Shortly after this he mentioned to as group of colleagues what a wretched business it was that the thing should explode in the middle of a city.  His boss, [[Walter Thiel]], came to hear of the comment and called him aside, \"Apel, you should have joined the medical service: you're too soft for the work here\".  However, there is no indication that Apel's comment adversely affected his career prospects:  the researchers at Peenem\u00fcnde saw themselves as an elite team engaged in vital work, and the only realistic alternative career path would have led hm back to the military frontline.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nDuring 1943 it became clear that the British knew about the research facility at Peenem\u00fcnde.  With their US allies they launched a [[Bombing of Peenem\u00fcnde in World War II|succession of bombing raids]] to destroy it, starting in August 1943.  Most of the 733 people killed at Peenem\u00fcnde in the first bombing raid, on 17 August, were [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]], but the dead also included Erich Apel's boss, [[Walter Thiel]] and his family.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  By that time, however, Apel himself was far away, transferred in April 1943 with his own team of assembly specialists and administrators to the [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch|Linke-Hofmann-Werke (LHW)]] plant in [[Breslau| Breslau (as Wroc\u0142aw was known]] [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|before 1945)]].<ref name=EAlautwww/><ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  Breslau was traditionally a centre for railway production and LHB was traditionally a manufacturer of railway locomotives and rolling stock, but during the war its sophisticated engineering capabilities were also being adapted to produce components and sub-assemblies for the [[V-2 rocket|rocket]], which government propaganda was by now identifying as the \"Vergeltungswaffe 2\" (''\"Retribution weapon 2\"'' / V-2).<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  As the continuing bombing raids at the [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center]] had their effect through 1943 and 1944, the LHW plant became the assembly location for the [[V-2 rocket]]s.  In 1 April 1944, at the request of the LHW management, Erich Apel was released from his employment contract with the [[Waffenamt|Army High Command Weapons Agency]].  He was now employed directly as Chief Engineer and Assistant to the Technical Director at LHW.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1944 [[Red army|the war]] was [[Siege of Breslau|coming home to Germany]].  LHW now outsourced [[V-2 rocket]] production to a firm called \"Peterbau GmbH\" in [[Kleinbodungen]] near [[Nordhausen]].  With the assembly contract they sent Erich Apel, who with effect from January 1945 became Technical Director of Peterbau GmbH.  Apel's resolute determination to avoid politics now seemed to catch up with him, since the new location for rocket assembly was part of the vast underground factory at the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]].  Conditions were so dreadful that at least one commentator has suggested that the [[V-2 rocket]]s found more victims among the slave labourers engaged in constructing the underground factory and in working on the rockets than among the citizens of [[London]], the intended target of the finished rockets.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  Even if Erich Apel had nothing to do with setting up and running the vast deadly [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour infrastructure]], as the engineer responsible for the rockets he was naturally associated with it.  As [[Nazi Germany]] collapsed militarily and politically during the first part of 1945, Apel succeeded in getting back to his home village of [[Judenbach]].  Like millions of his compatriots he was determined to make a clean break with the past.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\n=== Soviet occupation zone ===\n[[End of World War II in Europe|War ended]], formally, in May 1945.  The entire southern region of Germany had been liberated by the [[United States Army]], but the [[Allies of World War II|victorious powers]] had [[Yalta conference|already agreed]] a partition of the western two thirds of [[Nazi Germany|the country]] into four military occupation zones.  After the Americans had withdrawn to their agreed positions [[Judenbach]] was included in the middle portion of Germany that would now be administered as the [[Soviet occupation zone]].  Initially Apel worked on the local farms.  On 15 January 1946 he enrolled on the [[:de:Neulehrer|\"New Teachers\"]] programme.  With millions of working age Germans dead or in prison of war camps, there was a desperate shortage of teachers, and the scheme, implemented with varying levels of effectiveness in the various occupation zones, was designed to select those appropriately educated individuals who were thought to be not excessively tainted by Nazi involvement, to undergo a rapid \"re-education\" and set to work educating school-age children.  At the same time he both studied and taught, till 31 May 1946, at the Professional Business Academy in nearby [[Steinach, Thuringia|Steinach]].<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nIn January 1946 Erich Apel joined a political party, choosing the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (''\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\"'' / SPD)]].  Four months later, the SPD [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|merged]] with the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] to form the new [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\"'' / SED)]].  The merger was presented as a way to prevent divisions on the political left from opening up opportunities for right wing populists to [[Machtergreifung|take control]] as had happened after [[November 1932 German federal election|1932]].  In reality it never took effect except in the Soviet zone, where it received sustained practical backing from the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|military administration]].  The political development was not one for which Apel could muster much enthusiasm, and in common with many [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] members he was not one of those \"volunteering\" to sign his party membership over to the new party<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/> (though he was accepted as a member of the SED, eleven years later, in 1957<ref name=EAlautwww/>).\n\n=== An island in the middle of a lake west of Moscow ===\n\nOn 1 June 1956 Apel was \"picked up\" by the Soviet authorities.  They showed no interest in his association with [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] at the underground rocket factory at [[Mittelbau-Dora]].  But they were nevertheless interested in the factory; and they did make him an offer which, for a range of practical reasons, he was almost certainly in no position to refuse.  The Soviets invited him to work with them as chief engineer and representative of the (former) factory management at the Soviet Technical Commission in the [[Bleicherode]] quarter of Nordhausen (which had also ended up in the Soviet zone), adjacent to the vast underground rocket plant.<ref name=EAlautwww/><ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nSoviet interest in the German rocket programme was fully shared by the United States.  During the chaotic closing weeks of the war [[Wernher von Braun]] had traveled to [[Nordhausen]] and met with Apel, offering to take him to America after the military defeat which by now everyone saw as inevitable.  Von Braun was keen, as far as possible, to keep his full team with him.  But his specialist in rocket hydraulics turned him down.  Apel did not want to volunteer for further work in the weapons industry.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nOn 22 October 1946, across the [[Soviet occupation zone]], in the early hours of the morning technicians and engineers from the rocket project were visited by Soviet officers, each accompanied by a translator.  A brief instruction was read out:  \"By order of the Soviet Military Administration you must work for five years in the Soviet Union.  You can take your wife and family with you, and as many of your personal effects as you wish ...\".  Till now Apel's working life had involved living in guest houses or barracks so he did not have many personal effects.  Just hours after the order was given Apel and his colleagues were on the train heading east as part of [[Operation Osoaviakhim]].  The mood on the train was dark and apprehensive.  The journey took around 14 days.  Their ultimate destination was an island in the middle of [[Lake Seliger]] in a sparsely inhabited marshy region some {{convert|400|km}} northwest of [[Moscow]].<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nBefore crossing to the island Apel was taken to [[Korolyov, Moscow Oblast|Podlipki (today Korolyov)]] where he was reunited with a large quantity of heavy machinery and equipment that he had last seen in Germany during the closing weeks of the war.  [[Operation Barbarossa|The German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941 had forced the Soviets to build up an impressive expertise in deconstructing factories and their equipment, crating them up, and relocating them by train to places beyond the reach of the [[Wehrmacht|German army]].  After the war they had taken the opportunity to perfect their skills, crating up surviving German factories and their equipment, and taking them to the Soviet Union by way of war reparations.  The 1937 [[Opel Kadett]] turned up in 1947 as the Soviet built [[Moskvitch 400-420|Moskvitch 400]].  They had also applied their skill to the rocket facility in the mountain.  The [[Red army]] had used 717 railway wagons to carry away 5,647 tonnes of machinery, munitions, and partially constructed rockets.  By the end of 1946 a further 2,270 railway wagons had transported another 14,256 rocket construction plant, partially constructed rockets, and specialist machinery from the former Nazi facility in the Soviet occupation zone to a new rocket research facility in the Soviet Union.  Secrecy was so complete that ten years later the world still believed that Soviet rocket programme was based on Soviet rocket science. The Americans had taken away only 400 tonnes of \"rocket materials\" from he Nordhausen facility.  After inspecting the Soviet hoard, Erich Apel joined his colleagues on the [[Gorodomlya Island|Island of Gorodomlya]].<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/><ref name=\"EAlautJA\">{{cite web|url= http://www.storyal.de/Story-2015/Erich-Apel.html|title=Erich Apel  ....  Wer war Erich Apel?|author=Prof. Dr.-Ing. J\u00fcrgen Albrecht (compiler-publisher)|date= 3 December 2015|accessdate=3 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nKeeping the German workers on an island helped enforce the secrecy, but the German experts nevertheless received wages twice as high as those of their Soviet counterparts.  Erich Apel became head of a testing department.  Seventy year later a colleague from those times remembered him as \"sociable, but also a little distant.  Not so proletarian, and always a bit 'the boss'\" (''\"\"Er war gesellig, aber auch ein bisschen distanziert.  Nicht so proletenhaft, immer auch ein bisschen 'Der Chef'\"'').  There was no attempt to integrate the Germans into the Soviet research teams.  Stalin never intended that they should remain permanently.  The idea was to \"milk\" their knowledge till their Soviet counterparts had absorbed all the necessary knowledge.  That point was reached by the end of 1948, after which the Germans on the island were restricted to \"theoretical\" research.  That suited Apel well enough.  He had found a new wife, Christa, the daughter of a German aircraft engineer from the [[:de:Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado aircraft plant]].  Information on his first marriage remains in short supply:  Christa Apel said later that she believed Erich had married an Austrian woman around 1942, but the first marriage had ended in divorce because Apel's war work meant he was almost always away.  It was frequently indicated that during his six years in the Soviet Union Erich Apel became a communist, but in his bones it seems reasonable to conclude that he remained a political agnostic.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\n=== German Democratic Republic ===\nErich Apel returned on 2 June 1952.  The [[Soviet occupation zone]] had been relaunched in October 1949 as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]], seen by many - especially in the west - as a new kind of [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]].  There was no call, in East Germany, for specialist expertise in weapons and rocketry.  Other branches of heavy industry remained in place, however.  Just four months after getting back, Erich Apel was working as a Chief Engineer and Department Head at the East German Ministry for Machinery Construction.  Promotion to a Technical Directorship followed in April 1953.  In November 1953 he became a deputy minister in the department,<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/><ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 20 March 1958.</ref> working under [[Heinrich Rau]].<ref name=EAlautJA/>\n\nHe owed his rapid advancement in the new state to its leader, [[Walter Ulbricht]].  After years under military occupation which in many ways placed Soviet well-being ahead of German reconstruction, Ulbricht had narrowly survived the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953 Uprising]] and was now keen to demonstrate that under Soviet sponsorship it was possible to create in East Germany a fully functioning socialist state.  For that he needed technical experts and talented administrators.  Apel was both.  An important political ally and sponsor was [[:de:Fritz Selbmann|Fritz Selbmann]].  After his six years in the Soviet Union, Apel (like Selbmann), was a convinced proponent of a \"[[Planned economy]]\".  The choice was one between \"Rationalty\" (''Vernunft'') and \"Chaos\".  It was already apparent that in West Germany free market capitalism was giving rise to far more rapid economic growth than anything happening in East Germany.  The lesson to be drawn was that economic planning had to be undertaken competently and in microscopic detail by the government.  Political leadership was needed.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>\n\nIn June 1954, already a junior government minister, Apel became a candidate for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership.  Membership was granted in March 1957.<ref name=EAlautwww/>  Slightly more than one year later, in July 1958, he became a candidate for Central Committee membership.<ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 17. July 1958</ref>  In July 1960 Erich Apel became one of approximately 112 members of the powerful [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Party Central Committee]].<ref name=EAlautwww/><ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 24 July 1960</ref>  Under the Leninist constitutional structure in place, the Central Committee exercised a far tighter degree of control than government ministers or the [[Volkskammer|National Parliament (''Volkskammer'')]].  It was therefore by most reckoning a promotion when on 6 February 1958 Erich Apel resigned his ministerial position and accepted a position as head of the newly created Economic Commission of the Central Committee's Politburo.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  In 1958 he also became a member of the [[Volkskammer]], in which capacity he chaired the Parliamentary Economic Committee.<ref name=EAlautwww/>\n\nThe economic challenges facing East Germany were already formidable by 1960.  The mandate Walter Ulbricht gave to the new Economic Commission was summed up in the mantra which the leader liked to repeat.  East Germany should \"overtake without catching up\" (''\"\u00fcberholen ohne einzuholen\"'').  East Germans must be able to eat more butter and meat than West Germans. One day they must be able to travel in faster cars and live in better apartments.  This must be accomplished without having to copy \"capitalist production methods\".  Erich Apel must make it happen, not \"someday ... never\", but by creating and following a plan.  If it was a dream, it was a dream in which many comrades evidently believed.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  In July 1961 Apel was promoted to candidate membership of the politburo and secretaryship of the Central Committee.<ref>[[Neues Deutschland]], 5 July 1961.</ref>  There were other appointments which combined to stress his importance in the wider government project.  In 1960 he received a doctorate in return for a dissertation on the so-called East German Chemistry Programme.<ref name=EAlautwww/>\n\nThe \"Chemistry Programme\" was a seven-year plan, launched in 1958 under the widely communicated motto \"Chemistry gives us bread, welfare and beauty\" (''\"Chemie gibt Brot, Wohlstand und Sch\u00f6nheit\"''), and designed to double chemicals production by 1965, making it the country's second largest industrial sector after mechanical engineering.  The project was closely identified with Erich Apel, whose intellectual brilliance marked him, and the project, out for success.  But reality got in the way of the targets.  Reparations extracted by the Soviets had bled the country of its capacity to rebuild and maintain the infrastructure necessary to support the East German government's economic aspirations.  Cut off by international political rivalries from western and world markets, the nation continued to be dependent on deliveries of vital raw materials from the [[Soviet Union]], and the partnership with the Soviets, even at the height of the [[Cold War]], was far less fraternal than would have been assumed at the time in the west.  Recently discovered documents indicate that even in 1959 Moscow agreed to deliver to the German Democratic Republic only around half the raw materials which the East German economic plan for 1960-62 called for.<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/>  One solution was to try and select trading partners according to commercial criteria and not purely according to political dogma.  The economic blockade dividing East Germany from the west was largely self-imposed: between 1962 and 1965 Apel was able to oversee a modest trend whereby the proportion of East Germany's foreign trade with west rose from 21% to 25% of the total.  But more than half of the country's trade was reported in 1965 to be with the Soviet Union, conducted on terms favourable to Moscow and disadvantageous to East Germany, applying set prices that were well below \"world market prices\", both for exports and for imports.<ref name=EAlautSpiegel511965/>\n\nIn 1964 [[Otto Grotewohl]] and [[Willi Stoph]] took over as Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of East Germany]]<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/> Council of Ministers]].  At the time there were some who saw Stoph as Walter Ulbricht's heir apparent.  A level of rivalry within the Party Central Committee was normal, but between Apel and Stoph there quickly emerged a particularly intense mutual antagonism.  To the extent that both men were responsible for delivering a better future for the people there was an inherent overlap between their public profiles.  Stoph never missed a chance to highlight a failure to meet planned objectives or to criticise Apel's actions and utterances.  Pressure also increased from Moscow where [[Nikita Khrushchev]] fell from power in October 1964.  [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the new party secretary in Moscow, condemned his predecessor's \"failures of economic leadership\".  There were a number of rapid practical changes.  Soviet wheat deliveries to East Germany planned for 1966 were cut back to 400,000 tonnes, a third of the annual quantity in existing plans.  Within the East German leadership Apel had always been able to count on backing for his reforms from Walter Ulbricht, but the changes in Moscow meant that Ulbricht's driving priority had was now to secure his own position.<ref name=EAlautWST/>  Back in January 1963 Ulbricht had stunned colleagues, under the influence of Apel, announcing a 180-degree reversal on economic policy.  \"We need economics to trump politics\" ('' \"Wir brauchen ein Primat der \u00d6konomie \u00fcber die Politik!\"'').<ref name=EAlautGD/>  There was talk of revitalising the market and allowing private trade - subject to a restrictive framework - and of moving society away from a semi-military footing towards a civil one.<ref name=EAlautGD/>  That had been in 1963, before the fall of Khrushchev.  But now the leader was ready for another 180 degree reversal over economic policy.<ref name=\"Baylis1974\">{{cite book|author=Thomas A.
