Spinosaur remains have generally been attributed to the Early to Mid [[Cretaceous]], with the exception of the ''[[Ostafrikasaurus]]'' from the [[Late Jurassic]].\n\nSpinosaurids were large [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]]s with elongated, crocodile-like skulls lined with conical teeth bearing little to no [[serration]]s, and small [[Sagittal crest|crests]] on top of their heads. The teeth in the front end of their lower jaws fanned out into a spoon-shaped structure similar to a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], which gave the animal a characteristic look. Their shoulders were robust, prominent and bore stocky forelimbs with giant \"hooked\" claws on the first finger of their hands. Many genera had unusually tall [[neural spines]] on their [[vertebra]]e, which supported [[Neural spine sail|sails]] or humps of skin or fat tissue.\n\nDirect fossil evidence and anatomical adaptations indicate that spinosaurids were at least partly [[piscivorous]],<ref name=\":3\" /> with additional fossil finds indicating they also hunted [[pterosaur]]s and small to medium-sized dinosaurs.

Rayfield and colleagues, in 2007, conducted biomechanical studies on the skull of ''Baryonyx'', which had a long, laterally compressed skull, comparing it to [[gharial]] (long, narrow, tubular) and [[alligator]] (flat and wide) skulls. They found that the structure of baryonychine jaws converged on that of gharials, in that the two taxa showed similar response patterns to stress from simulated feeding loads, and did so with and without the presence of a (simulated) secondary palate. The gharial, exemplar of a long, narrow, and tubular snout, is a fish specialist. However, this snout anatomy does not preclude other options for the spinosaurids. The gharial is the most extreme example and a fish specialist; [[Australian Freshwater Crocodile|Australian freshwater crocodiles]] (''Crocodylus johnstoni''), which have similarly shaped skulls to gharials, also specialize more on fish than sympatric, broad snouted crocodiles and are opportunistic feeders which eat all manner of small aquatic prey, including insects and [[crustacean]]s. Thus, spinosaurids' snouts correlate with piscivory; this is consistent with hypotheses of this diet for spinosaurids, in particular baryonychines, but it does not indicate that they were solely piscivorous.<ref name=\"rayfieldetal2007\">Rayfield, Emily J., Angela C.

''Baryonyx'' had, in models where the size difference of the skulls was corrected for, greater resistance to torsion and dorsoventral bending than both ''Spinosaurus'' and the gharial, while both spinosaurids were inferior to the gharial, alligator, and [[slender-snouted crocodile]] in resisting torsion and medio-lateral bending. When the results from the modeling were not scaled according to size, then both spinosaurids performed better than all the crocodilians in resistance to bending and torsion, due to their larger size.

In Africa, baronychines were common in the Aptian, and then replaced by spinosaurines in the Albian and Cenomanian.<ref name=BuffetautandOuaja2002>Buffetaut, Eric, and Mohamed Ouaja. 2002. \u201cA New Specimen of Spinosaurus (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Tunisia, with Remarks on the Evolutionary History of the Spinosauridae.\u201d Bulletin de La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9ologique de France 173 (5): 415\u201321. doi:10.2113/173.5.415.</ref>\n\nSome intermediate specimens extend the known range of spinosaurids past the youngest dates of named taxa.

Spinosaur remains have generally been attributed to the Early to Mid [[Cretaceous]], with the exception of the ''[[Ostafrikasaurus]]'' from the [[Late Jurassic]].\n\nSpinosaurids were large [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]]s with elongated, crocodile-like skulls lined with conical teeth bearing little to no [[serration]]s, and small [[Sagittal crest|crests]] on top of their heads. The teeth in the front end of their lower jaws fanned out into a spoon-shaped structure similar to a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], which gave the animal a characteristic look. Their shoulders were robust, prominent and bore stocky forelimbs with giant \"hooked\" claws on the first finger of their hands. Many genera had unusually tall [[neural spines]] on their [[vertebra]]e, which supported [[Neural spine sail|sails]] or humps of skin or fat tissue.\n\nDirect fossil evidence and anatomical adaptations indicate that spinosaurids were at least partly [[piscivorous]],<ref name=\":3\" /> with additional fossil finds indicating they also hunted [[pterosaur]]s and small to medium-sized dinosaurs. [[Osteological]] analyses have suggested a [[List of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]] lifestyle for some members of this clade.\n\n==Description==\n\n=== Body size ===\n[[File:Spinosaur scale chart.png|thumb|left|Size comparison of various spinosaurids with a human]]\n\nAlthough reliable size and weight estimates for most taxa are hindered by the lack of good material, all known spinosaurids were large animals.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=HONE|first=David William Elliott|last2=HOLTZ|first2=Thomas Richard|date=2017|title=A Century of Spinosaurs - A Review and Revision of the Spinosauridae with Comments on Their Ecology|journal=Acta Geologica Sinica - English Edition|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=1120\u20131132|doi=10.1111/1755-6724.13328|issn=1000-9515|url=http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/49404}}</ref> The smallest, ''[[Irritator]]'', was between 6 and 8 meters in length and 1 tonne (1.1 short tons) in weight.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateguidetod0000dixo|url-access=registration|title=The Ultimate Guide to Dinosaurs|last=Dixon|first=Dougal|date=2009|publisher=Ticktock Books|isbn=9781846969881|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Holtz20082\">Holtz, Thomas R.

Examinations in 2017 by Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz indicate that the South American spinosaurids ''Angaturama'' and ''Irritator'' were intermediate between Baronychinae and Spinosaurinae based on their craniodental features and cladistic analysis.

Rayfield and colleagues, in 2007, conducted biomechanical studies on the skull of ''Baryonyx'', which had a long, laterally compressed skull, comparing it to [[gharial]] (long, narrow, tubular) and [[alligator]] (flat and wide) skulls. They found that the structure of baryonychine jaws converged on that of gharials, in that the two taxa showed similar response patterns to stress from simulated feeding loads, and did so with and without the presence of a (simulated) secondary palate. The gharial, exemplar of a long, narrow, and tubular snout, is a fish specialist. However, this snout anatomy does not preclude other options for the spinosaurids. The gharial is the most extreme example and a fish specialist; [[Australian Freshwater Crocodile|Australian freshwater crocodiles]] (''Crocodylus johnstoni''), which have similarly shaped skulls to gharials, also specialize more on fish than sympatric, broad snouted crocodiles and are opportunistic feeders which eat all manner of small aquatic prey, including insects and [[crustacean]]s. Thus, spinosaurids' snouts correlate with piscivory; this is consistent with hypotheses of this diet for spinosaurids, in particular baryonychines, but it does not indicate that they were solely piscivorous.<ref name=\"rayfieldetal2007\">Rayfield, Emily J., Angela C.

''Baryonyx'' had, in models where the size difference of the skulls was corrected for, greater resistance to torsion and dorsoventral bending than both ''Spinosaurus'' and the gharial, while both spinosaurids were inferior to the gharial, alligator, and [[slender-snouted crocodile]] in resisting torsion and medio-lateral bending. When the results from the modeling were not scaled according to size, then both spinosaurids performed better than all the crocodilians in resistance to bending and torsion, due to their larger size. Thus, Cuff and Rayfield suggest that the skulls are not efficiently built to deal well with relatively large, struggling prey, but that spinosaurids may overcome prey simply by their size advantage, and not skull build.<ref name=\"CuffandRayfield2013\">Cuff, Andrew R., and Emily J.

Isotope ratios from teeth from ''Baryonyx'', ''Irritator'', ''Siamosaurus'', and ''Spinosaurus'' were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study found that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. ''Siamosaurus'' specimens tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and ''Spinosaurus'' tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in water. The authors also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory in spinosaurids can explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods: by feeding on different prey items and living in different habitats, the different types of  theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\"RMetal10\" />\n\nIn 2018, an analysis was conducted on the partial [[tibia]] of an indeterminate spinosaurine from the early [[Albian]], the bone was from a sub-adult between 7\u201313 m (22\u201342&nbsp;ft) in length still growing moderately fast before its death.

They are accompanied by a local guide.\n*Before reach their destination, the bus stopped at Argentino Lake and Andes for the travellers to take pictures.\n*The bus also stopped at Mirador de los Suspiros (Balcony of Sighs) for the view of the glaciers at a dsitance. The strong wind cause the camera of the prouduction team to shake a lot.\n*After reaching the Los Glaciares National Park, they headed to the observatories to see the Perito Moreno Glacier up close.\n*The glacier has an average height of {{convert|74|m|ft|abbr=on}}, width of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} and length of {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The area of glacier (250km{{sup|2}}) is bigger than the size of Buenos Aires (203km{{sup|2}}).\n*They are overwhelmed by the enormous size of the glacier.\n*They notice the different in gray colour of the water on the left of glacier as it is due to the lime in the water while the right side is blue.\n*The local guide explain that they might be lucky to witness the collapse (or rupture) of the ice tunnel, that happens every 2 or 3 years, on the glacier as many broadcasting companies will come to make documentories and television programs.\n*They decided to eat some gimbap while wait for the glacier to [[Ice calving|calve]] (fall). They were able to witness the calving of the glacier after over an hour of waiting.\n*As it apporach midday, more calving of the glacier are captured by the production team.\n*After lunch, they took a boat from the dock and reach the edge of the glacier for a mini-trekking experience. The trekking guide explained how the water holes (moulin) on the glacier is formed.\n*After trekking, they visited the supermarket to buy groceries to cook jjapaguri for their dinner. They were surprised on how cheap the price of ribeye and tenderloin are as compared to South Korea.\n|-\n!7\n|28 March 2020\n|8\n|{{small|7 December 2019}}\n|style=background:lightpink|[[Fitz Roy]]\n|\"Class of Fitz Roy\"\n|-\n|}\n{{hidden end}}\n\n==Original soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name      = Traveler \u2013 Argentina Original Television Soundtrack\n| type      = [[soundtrack]]\n| artist    = Various Artists\n| released  = 2020\n| genre     = [[Soundtrack]]\n| language  = {{hlist|[[Korean language|Korean]]|[[English language|English]]}}\n| label     = [[Kakao M]]\n}}\n{{-}}\n===Part 1===\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Released on {{start date|2020|2|16|df=y}}\n| extra_column = Artist\n| title1 = Traveler's Song\n| note1 = \ub5a0\ub098\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud560 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uac78\n| lyrics1 = Harim\n| music1 = Harim\n| extra1 = Harim\n| length1 = 4:06\n| title2 = Traveler's Song\n| note2 = Guitar Ver.\n| lyrics2 = Harim\n| music2 = Harim\n| extra2 = Harim\n| length2 = 4:46\n| title3 = Traveler's Song\n| note3 = Inst.\n| music3 = Harim\n| length3 = 4:06\n| title4 = Traveler's Song\n| note4 = Guitar Ver.)

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]].

Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]].

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened.

A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somerville's collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency.

The bedrooms are arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.\n\nThe building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to be one of the three Oxford colleges which can allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their three or four-year undergraduate degree courses.<ref name=Oxfordwebsite /><ref name=whychoose />\n\n===Gardens===\n[[File:Park Lawn, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|]]\nSomerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass.

She was succeeded by the classical scholar [[Emily Penrose]] (1906\u20131926), who set up in 1903 the ''Mary Somerville Research Fellowship'' offering women in Oxford opportunities for research.\n\nThe current principal is [[Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon]], who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding [[Alice Prochaska]].<ref name=\"ox\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-02-10-new-somerville-principal-announced |title=New Somerville Principal announced &#124; University of Oxford |website=ox.ac.uk |accessdate=2018-08-20}}</ref> To date seven principals have been alumnae of Somerville, two of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's College]].\n\n==Coat of arms and motto==\nLike all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]], [[Bertha Johnson]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]]. There are also remains of some 19th-century buildings, including a stone-lined well.<ref name=hughes>{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/the-catherine-hughes-building/ |title=The Catherine Hughes Building |access-date=30 August 2018 |website=www.some.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Walton House===\n[[File:Walton House, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|right|House seen from the east]]\nThe original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=26}} The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63899#n43 |title=Somerville College \u2013 British History Online |website=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> In 1881, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, [[Walter Cave]] added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}}\n\nToday House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college's paintings by [[Roger Fry]] are located here.<ref name=artuk /> Most of the administration of college, and the academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[George Frederic Watts]].<ref name=artuk />\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Park Building, Somerville College, Oxford University.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]\nOriginally known as West, due to its location within the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was deisgned to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}}\n\n[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] have been notable benefactors to the library.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}} The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, [[John Constable]], [[Maud Sumner]] and [[Patrick George]].<ref name=artuk />\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/ |title=John Stuart Mill Collection \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities.

A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] Colleges for \u00a34,000 and \u00a31,400 respectively.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time.\n\nMaitland now houses few students, being mainly occupied by fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall.<ref name=\"blogs.some.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Penrose===\nThe Penrose block was designed by [http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/mayors/1836_1962/rogers_harold_1937.html/ Harold Rogers] in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. A row of poplars had to be removed in 1926 for the construction to take place at the south-western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A Walton Street.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/>{{sfn |Manuel|2013 |p=35}} It was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named after Dame [[Emily Penrose]], the third principal of the college. It contains mainly first-year accommodation, with around 30 rooms.<ref name=\"blogs.some.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Darbishire===\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford UK.png|thumb|right|Darbishire Quad]]\nDarbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the Oxford Oratory. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

The process is a part of the [[nutrient cycle]] and is essential for recycling the finite matter that occupies physical space in the [[biosphere]]. Bodies of [[Organism|living organisms]] begin to decompose shortly after [[death]]. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. Organisms that do this are known as [[decomposer]]s. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition. The science which studies decomposition is generally referred to as ''[[taphonomy]]'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''taphos'', meaning tomb.\n\nOne can differentiate '''abiotic''' from '''biotic substance''' ([[biodegradation]]). The former means \"degradation of a substance by [[Chemical decomposition|chemical]] or physical processes, e.g., [[hydrolysis]].<ref>Water Quality Vocabulary.

[[putrefaction]], the breakdown of tissues by [[bacteria]].

Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, [[gravity]] causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body, creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed [[livor mortis]] or, more commonly, lividity.\n\nOnce the heart stops, the [[blood]] can no longer supply [[oxygen]] or remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the tissues. The resulting decrease in pH and other chemical changes causes cells to lose their [[structural integrity]], bringing about the release of cellular enzymes capable of initiating the breakdown of surrounding cells and tissues. This process is known as [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]].\n\nVisible changes caused by decomposition are limited during the fresh stage, although autolysis may cause blisters to appear at the surface of the skin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Bernard |title= Forensic pathology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-520903-7|title-link=Forensic pathology }}</ref>\n\nThe small amount of oxygen remaining in the body is quickly depleted by cellular [[metabolism]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic microbes]] naturally present in [[respiratory tract|respiratory]] and [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] tracts, creating an ideal environment for the proliferation of [[anaerobic organism]]s.

This is due, in part, to the limited number of insects that can penetrate a coffin and the lower temperatures under soil.\n\nThe rate and manner of decomposition in an animal body is strongly affected by several factors. In roughly descending degrees of importance, they are:\n* [[Temperature]];\n* The availability of [[oxygen]];\n* Prior [[embalming]];\n* [[List of causes of death by rate|Cause of death]];\n* [[Burial]], depth of burial, and soil type;\n* Access by [[scavenger]]s;\n* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]], including [[wound]]s and crushing blows;\n* [[Humidity]], or wetness;\n* [[Rain]]fall;\n* Bodysize and weight;\n* [[Clothing]];\n* The surface on which the body rests;\n* Foods/objects inside the specimen's [[digestive tract]] (bacon compared to lettuce).\n\nThe speed at which decomposition occurs varies greatly. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and the season of death all determine how fast a fresh body will skeletonize or mummify. A basic guide for the effect of environment on decomposition is given as Casper's Law (or Ratio): if all other factors are equal, then, when there is free access of air a body decomposes twice as fast than if immersed in water and eight times faster than if buried in earth. Ultimately, the rate of bacterial decomposition acting on the tissue will depend upon the temperature of the surroundings. Colder temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition while warmer temperatures increase it. A dry body will not decompose efficiently. Moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter, but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/dont-bag-it/chapter-1-the-decomposition-process/|title=Chapter 1, The Decomposition Process {{!}} Earth-Kind\u00ae Landscaping|website=aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe most important variable is a body's accessibility to insects, particularly flies. On the surface in tropical areas, invertebrates alone can easily reduce a fully fleshed corpse to clean bones in under two weeks. The skeleton itself is not permanent; [[acid]]s in [[soil]]s can reduce it to unrecognizable components. This is one reason given for the lack of human remains found in the wreckage of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], even in parts of the ship considered inaccessible to scavengers. Freshly skeletonized bone is often called \"green\" bone and has a characteristic greasy feel. Under certain conditions (normally cool, damp soil), bodies may undergo [[saponification]] and develop a waxy substance called [[adipocere]], caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body's [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s. The formation of adipocere slows decomposition by inhibiting the bacteria that cause putrefaction.\n\nIn extremely dry or cold conditions, the normal process of decomposition is halted&nbsp;\u2013 by either lack of moisture or temperature controls on bacterial and enzymatic action&nbsp;\u2013 causing the body to be preserved as a [[mummy]]. Frozen mummies commonly restart the decomposition process when thawed (see [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman]]), whilst heat-desiccated mummies remain so unless exposed to moisture.\n\nThe bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition. They lack the internal microbial flora that produce much of decomposition and quite commonly mummify if kept in even moderately dry conditions.\n\n=== Anaerobic vs aerobic ===\nAerobic decomposition takes place in the presence of oxygen. This is most common to occur in nature. Living organisms that use oxygen to survive feed on the body. Anaerobic decomposition takes place in the absence of oxygen. This could be place where the body is buried in organic material and oxygen can not reach it. This process of putrefaction has a bad odor accompanied by it due to the hydrogen sulfide and organic matter containing sulfur.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n=== Artificial preservation  ===\n[[Embalming]] is the practice of delaying decomposition of human and animal remains. Embalming slows decomposition somewhat, but does not forestall it indefinitely. Embalmers typically pay great attention to parts of the body seen by mourners, such as the face and hands. The chemicals used in embalming repel most insects, and slow down bacterial putrefaction by either killing existing bacteria in or on the body themselves or by \"fixing\" cellular proteins, which means that they cannot act as a nutrient source for subsequent bacterial infections. In sufficiently dry environments, an embalmed body may end up [[mummy|mummified]] and it is not uncommon for bodies to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades. Notable viewable embalmed bodies include those of:\n* [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] of [[Argentina]], whose body was injected with [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] was kept perfectly preserved for many years, and still is as far as is known (her body is no longer on public display).\n* [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Soviet Union]], whose body was kept submerged in a special tank of fluid for decades and is on public display in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]].\n** Other [[Communist]] leaders with pronounced [[cults of personality]] such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Il-sung]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and most recently [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] have also had their cadavers preserved in the fashion of Lenin's preservation and are now displayed in their respective mausoleums.\n* [[Pope John XXIII]], whose preserved body can be viewed in [[St. Peter's Basilica]].\n* [[Padre Pio]], whose body was injected with [[formalin]] prior to burial in a dry vault{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} from which he was later removed and placed on public display at the [[San Giovanni Rotondo]].\n\n=== Environmental preservation ===\nA body buried in a sufficiently dry environment may be well preserved for decades. This was observed in the case for murdered [[civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]], who was found to be almost perfectly preserved over 30 years after his death, permitting an accurate [[autopsy]] when the case of his murder was re-opened in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Quigley | first=C. | title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century | publisher=McFarland | year=1998 | pages=213\u2013214 | isbn=978-0-7864-0492-6}}</ref>\n\nBodies submerged in a [[peat]] [[bog]] may become naturally \"embalmed\", arresting decomposition and resulting in a preserved specimen known as a [[bog body]]. The time for an embalmed body to be reduced to a [[skeleton]] varies greatly. Even when a body is decomposed, embalming treatment can still be achieved (the arterial system decays more slowly) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work, and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition.\n\nAn animal can be preserved almost perfectly, for millions of years in a resin such as amber.\n\nThere are some examples where bodies have been inexplicably preserved (with no human intervention) for decades or centuries and appear almost the same as when they died. In some religious groups, this is known as [[incorruptibility]].

Each frame is approximately 12 hours apart, as the fruit shrivels and becomes covered with [[mold]].]]\nDecomposition of plant matter occurs in many stages. It begins with leaching by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for [[microbial]] colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous [[detritivore]] species.\n\nFollowing this, the plant [[detritus]] (consisting of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], microbial products, and [[lignin]]) undergoes chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their [[chemical structure]].\n\nFor instance, [[lignin]] is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain [[fungi]], such as the black-rot fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Micha\u0142|last2=Sobczyk|first2=\u0141ukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013|pmc=4931425}}</ref> Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of [[Xylophagy|saproxylic]] insects may develop<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Micha\u0142|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2016-09-01|title=Nutritional dynamics during the development of xylophagous beetles related to changes in the stoichiometry of 11 elements|doi-access=free|journal=Physiological Entomology|volume=42|language=en|pages=73\u201384|doi=10.1111/phen.12168|issn=1365-3032}}</ref> and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow.

Bodies of [[Organism|living organisms]] begin to decompose shortly after [[death]]. Animals, such as worms, also help decompose the organic materials. Organisms that do this are known as [[decomposer]]s. Although no two organisms decompose in the same way, they all undergo the same sequential stages of decomposition.

This is due, in part, to the limited number of insects that can penetrate a coffin and the lower temperatures under soil.\n\nThe rate and manner of decomposition in an animal body is strongly affected by several factors. In roughly descending degrees of importance, they are:\n* [[Temperature]];\n* The availability of [[oxygen]];\n* Prior [[embalming]];\n* [[List of causes of death by rate|Cause of death]];\n* [[Burial]], depth of burial, and soil type;\n* Access by [[scavenger]]s;\n* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]], including [[wound]]s and crushing blows;\n* [[Humidity]], or wetness;\n* [[Rain]]fall;\n* Bodysize and weight;\n* [[Clothing]];\n* The surface on which the body rests;\n* Foods/objects inside the specimen's [[digestive tract]] (bacon compared to lettuce).\n\nThe speed at which decomposition occurs varies greatly. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and the season of death all determine how fast a fresh body will skeletonize or mummify. A basic guide for the effect of environment on decomposition is given as Casper's Law (or Ratio): if all other factors are equal, then, when there is free access of air a body decomposes twice as fast than if immersed in water and eight times faster than if buried in earth. Ultimately, the rate of bacterial decomposition acting on the tissue will depend upon the temperature of the surroundings. Colder temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition while warmer temperatures increase it. A dry body will not decompose efficiently. Moisture helps the growth of microorganisms that decompose the organic matter, but too much moisture could lead to anaerobic conditions slowing down the decomposition process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/earthkind/landscape/dont-bag-it/chapter-1-the-decomposition-process/|title=Chapter 1, The Decomposition Process {{!}} Earth-Kind\u00ae Landscaping|website=aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe most important variable is a body's accessibility to insects, particularly flies. On the surface in tropical areas, invertebrates alone can easily reduce a fully fleshed corpse to clean bones in under two weeks. The skeleton itself is not permanent; [[acid]]s in [[soil]]s can reduce it to unrecognizable components. This is one reason given for the lack of human remains found in the wreckage of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']], even in parts of the ship considered inaccessible to scavengers. Freshly skeletonized bone is often called \"green\" bone and has a characteristic greasy feel. Under certain conditions (normally cool, damp soil), bodies may undergo [[saponification]] and develop a waxy substance called [[adipocere]], caused by the action of soil chemicals on the body's [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s. The formation of adipocere slows decomposition by inhibiting the bacteria that cause putrefaction.\n\nIn extremely dry or cold conditions, the normal process of decomposition is halted&nbsp;\u2013 by either lack of moisture or temperature controls on bacterial and enzymatic action&nbsp;\u2013 causing the body to be preserved as a [[mummy]]. Frozen mummies commonly restart the decomposition process when thawed (see [[\u00d6tzi the Iceman]]), whilst heat-desiccated mummies remain so unless exposed to moisture.\n\nThe bodies of newborns who never ingested food are an important exception to the normal process of decomposition. They lack the internal microbial flora that produce much of decomposition and quite commonly mummify if kept in even moderately dry conditions.\n\n=== Anaerobic vs aerobic ===\nAerobic decomposition takes place in the presence of oxygen. This is most common to occur in nature. Living organisms that use oxygen to survive feed on the body. Anaerobic decomposition takes place in the absence of oxygen. This could be place where the body is buried in organic material and oxygen can not reach it. This process of putrefaction has a bad odor accompanied by it due to the hydrogen sulfide and organic matter containing sulfur.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n=== Artificial preservation  ===\n[[Embalming]] is the practice of delaying decomposition of human and animal remains. Embalming slows decomposition somewhat, but does not forestall it indefinitely. Embalmers typically pay great attention to parts of the body seen by mourners, such as the face and hands. The chemicals used in embalming repel most insects, and slow down bacterial putrefaction by either killing existing bacteria in or on the body themselves or by \"fixing\" cellular proteins, which means that they cannot act as a nutrient source for subsequent bacterial infections. In sufficiently dry environments, an embalmed body may end up [[mummy|mummified]] and it is not uncommon for bodies to remain preserved to a viewable extent after decades. Notable viewable embalmed bodies include those of:\n* [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] of [[Argentina]], whose body was injected with [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] was kept perfectly preserved for many years, and still is as far as is known (her body is no longer on public display).\n* [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Soviet Union]], whose body was kept submerged in a special tank of fluid for decades and is on public display in [[Lenin's Mausoleum]].\n** Other [[Communist]] leaders with pronounced [[cults of personality]] such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Il-sung]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and most recently [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] have also had their cadavers preserved in the fashion of Lenin's preservation and are now displayed in their respective mausoleums.\n* [[Pope John XXIII]], whose preserved body can be viewed in [[St. Peter's Basilica]].\n* [[Padre Pio]], whose body was injected with [[formalin]] prior to burial in a dry vault{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} from which he was later removed and placed on public display at the [[San Giovanni Rotondo]].\n\n=== Environmental preservation ===\nA body buried in a sufficiently dry environment may be well preserved for decades. This was observed in the case for murdered [[civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]], who was found to be almost perfectly preserved over 30 years after his death, permitting an accurate [[autopsy]] when the case of his murder was re-opened in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Quigley | first=C. | title=Modern Mummies: The Preservation of the Human Body in the Twentieth Century | publisher=McFarland | year=1998 | pages=213\u2013214 | isbn=978-0-7864-0492-6}}</ref>\n\nBodies submerged in a [[peat]] [[bog]] may become naturally \"embalmed\", arresting decomposition and resulting in a preserved specimen known as a [[bog body]]. The time for an embalmed body to be reduced to a [[skeleton]] varies greatly. Even when a body is decomposed, embalming treatment can still be achieved (the arterial system decays more slowly) but would not restore a natural appearance without extensive reconstruction and cosmetic work, and is largely used to control the foul odors due to decomposition.\n\nAn animal can be preserved almost perfectly, for millions of years in a resin such as amber.\n\nThere are some examples where bodies have been inexplicably preserved (with no human intervention) for decades or centuries and appear almost the same as when they died. In some religious groups, this is known as [[incorruptibility]]. It is not known whether or for how long a body can stay free of decay without artificial preservation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/incorruptible.htm |title=How can a corpse be incorruptible? |first=Josh |last=Clark |publisher=HowStuffWorks|date=2008-05-05 }}</ref>\n\n=== Importance to forensic sciences ===\n{{Further|Forensic entomological decomposition}}\n\nVarious sciences study the decomposition of bodies under the general rubric of [[forensic science]] because the usual motive for such studies is to determine the time and cause of death for [[law|legal]] purposes:\n* Forensic taphonomy specifically studies the processes of decomposition in order to apply the biological and chemical principles to forensic cases in order to determine [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI), post-burial interval as well as to locate clandestine graves.\n* [[Forensic pathology]] studies the clues to the cause of death found in the corpse as a [[medicine|medical]] phenomenon.\n* [[Forensic entomology]] studies the insects and other [[vermin]] found in corpses; the sequence in which they appear, the kinds of insects, and where they are found in their life cycle are clues that can shed light on the time of death, the length of a corpse's exposure, and whether the corpse was moved.<ref>{{cite book | last=Smith | first=KGV. | title=A Manual of Forensic Entomology | publisher=Cornell Univ.

Each frame is approximately 12 hours apart, as the fruit shrivels and becomes covered with [[mold]].]]\nDecomposition of plant matter occurs in many stages. It begins with leaching by water; the most easily lost and soluble carbon compounds are liberated in this process. Another early process is physical breakup or fragmentation of the plant material into smaller bits which have greater surface area for [[microbial]] colonization and attack. In smaller dead plants, this process is largely carried out by the soil invertebrate fauna, whereas in the larger plants, primarily parasitic life-forms such as insects and fungi play a major breakdown role and are not assisted by numerous [[detritivore]] species.\n\nFollowing this, the plant [[detritus]] (consisting of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], microbial products, and [[lignin]]) undergoes chemical alteration by microbes. Different types of compounds decompose at different rates. This is dependent on their [[chemical structure]].\n\nFor instance, [[lignin]] is a component of wood, which is relatively resistant to decomposition and can in fact only be decomposed by certain [[fungi]], such as the black-rot fungi. Wood decomposition is a complex process involving fungi which transport nutrients to the nutritionally scarce wood from outside environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Micha\u0142|last2=Sobczyk|first2=\u0141ukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013|pmc=4931425}}</ref> Because of this nutritional enrichment the fauna of [[Xylophagy|saproxylic]] insects may develop<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Micha\u0142|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2016-09-01|title=Nutritional dynamics during the development of xylophagous beetles related to changes in the stoichiometry of 11 elements|doi-access=free|journal=Physiological Entomology|volume=42|language=en|pages=73\u201384|doi=10.1111/phen.12168|issn=1365-3032}}</ref> and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lignin is one such remaining product of decomposing plants with a very complex chemical structure causing the rate of microbial breakdown to slow.

Food decomposition can be slowed down by [[food conservation|conservation]]. The spoilage of meat occurs, if the meat is untreated, in a matter of hours or days and results in the meat becoming unappetizing, poisonous or infectious. Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent decomposition of meat by bacteria and fungi, which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time&nbsp;\u2013 though not indefinitely&nbsp;\u2013 if proper hygiene is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate food safety, food preservation and food storage procedures are applied.\n\nSpoilage of food is attributed to contamination from microorganisms such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts, along with natural decay of the food.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Food and nutrition|last=Anita|first=Tull|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-832766-0|location=|pages=154, 155|quote=|via=}}</ref> These decomposition bacteria reproduce at rapid rates under conditions of moisture and preferred temperatures. When the proper conditions are lacking the bacteria may form spores which lurk until suitable conditions arise to continue reproduction.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Rate of decomposition==\n\nThe rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors\u2014the physical environment (temperature, moisture and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.<ref name=\"Chapin159\">{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F.

Decomposition rates are highest in damp, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.  When the rains return and soils become wet, the [[osmotic gradient]] between the bacterial cells and the soil water causes the cells to gain water quickly. Under these conditions, many bacterial cells burst, releasing a pulse of nutrients.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/> Decomposition rates also tend to be slower in acidic soils.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/> Soils which are rich in [[clay minerals]] tend to have lower decomposition rates, and thus, higher levels of organic matter.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/> The smaller particles of clay result in a larger surface area that can hold water. The higher the water content of a soil, the lower the oxygen content<ref name=\"Chapin61\">{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A.

Clay minerals also bind particles of organic material to their surface, making them less accessible to microbes.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/> Soil disturbance like [[tillage|tilling]] increases decomposition by increasing the amount of oxygen in the soil and by exposing new organic matter to soil microbes.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/>\n\nThe quality and quantity of the material available to decomposers is another major factor that influences the rate of decomposition. Substances like sugars and amino acids decompose readily and are considered labile. [[Cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], which are broken down more slowly, are \"moderately labile\". Compounds which are more resistant to decay, like lignin or [[cutin]], are considered recalcitrant.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/> Litter with a higher proportion of labile compounds decomposes much more rapidly than does litter with a higher proportion of recalcitrant material. Consequently, dead animals decompose more rapidly than dead leaves, which themselves decompose more rapidly than fallen branches.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/> As organic material in the soil ages, its quality decreases. The more labile compounds decompose quickly, leaving an increasing proportion of recalcitrant material. Microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like [[chitin]], and these also accumulate as the microbes die, further reducing the quality of older [[soil organic matter]].<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cadaverine]]\n*[[Chemical decomposition]]\n* [[Ecosystem]]\n* [[Humus]]\n* [[Leachate]]\n* [[Microbiology of decomposition]]\n* [[Peat]] (turf)\n* [[Putrescine]]\n* [[Staling]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|decomposition|spoilage|perishable}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Decomposition}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160307204349/http://1lecture.com/microbiology/food%20spoilage/index.html 1Lecture.com] \u2013 Food decomposition (a Flash animation)\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box |title=[[Human growth pattern|Stages of human development]] |before=[[Death]] |after=[[Skeletonization]]|years=Decomposition}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n{{Death}}\n\n[[Category:Anaerobic digestion]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Biodegradable waste management]]\n[[Category:Composting]]\n[[Category:Signs of death]]\n[[Category:Biostratinomy]]\n", "name_user": "47.156.228.64", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(SCIENCE FAIRS ARE DUMB AS HEK)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition"}

''An Introduction to Quakerism'' ({{ISBN|0521841119}}), page 78.</ref> Later, in the 19th century, there was a diversification of theological beliefs in the Religious Society of Friends, and this led to several larger splits within the Quaker movement.\n\n====Hicksite\u2013Orthodox split====\nThe Hicksite\u2013Orthodox split arose out of both ideological and socioeconomic tensions. Philadelphia Yearly Meeting Hicksites tended to be agrarian and poorer than the more urban, wealthier, Orthodox Quakers. With increasing financial success, Orthodox Quakers wanted to \"make the Society a more respectable body\u2014to transform their sect into a church\u2014by adopting mainstream Protestant orthodoxy\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Glenn|title=Quakers Living in the Lion's Mouth: The Society of Friends in Northern Virginia, 1730\u20131865|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|pages=145}}</ref> Hicksites, though they held a variety of views, generally saw the market economy as corrupting, and believed Orthodox Quakers had sacrificed their orthodox Christian spirituality for material success. Hicksites viewed the Bible as secondary to the individual cultivation of God's light within.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Glenn|title=Quakers Living in the Lion's Mouth|pages=145}}</ref>\n\nWith Gurneyite Quakers' shift toward Protestant principles and away from the spiritualisation of human relations, women's role as promoters of \"holy conversation\" started to decrease. Conversely, within the Hicksite movement the rejection of the market economy and the continuing focus on community and family bonds tended to encourage women to retain their role as powerful arbiters.\n\n[[Elias Hicks]]' religious views were claimed to be [[universalist]] and to contradict Quakers' historical orthodox Christian beliefs and practices. Hicks' Gospel preaching and teaching precipitated the ''Great Separation'' of 1827, which resulted in a parallel system of Yearly Meetings in America, joined by Friends from Philadelphia, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Baltimore. They were referred to by their opponents as ''Hicksites'' and by others, and sometimes themselves, as ''orthodox''. Quakers in Great Britain recognised only the ''Orthodox'' Quakers and refused to correspond with the ''Hicksites.''\n\n====Beaconite controversy====\n[[Isaac Crewdson]] was a [[Recorded Minister]] in [[Manchester]], UK. His 1835 book ''A Beacon to the Society of Friends'' strongly argued that the inner light was at odds with a religious belief in [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ.<ref name=Bebbington>{{cite book|last=Bebbington|first=David William|title=Evangelicalism in modern Britain: a history from the 1730s to the 1980s|url=https://archive.org/details/evangelicalismin0000bebb|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Ltd|location=London |isbn=0-415-10464-5}}</ref>{{rp|page=155}} This Christian controversy led to Crewdson's resignation from the Religious Society of Friends, along with 48 fellow members of Manchester Meeting and about 250 other British Quakers in 1836\u201337.

This movement was led by British Quaker [[Joseph John Gurney]]. Christian Friends held [[Revival meeting]]s in America and became involved in the [[Holiness movement]] of churches.

Many eventually collectively became the Five Years Meeting and then [[Friends United Meeting]], although [[London Yearly Meeting]], which had been strongly Gurneyite in the 19th century, did not join either of these groups. These Quaker yearly meetings make up the largest proportion of Quakers in the world today.\n\nSome ''orthodox'' Quakers in America disliked the move towards evangelical Christianity and saw it as a dilution of Friends' traditional orthodox Christian belief in being inwardly led by the [[Holy Spirit]]. These Friends were led by [[John Wilbur (Quaker minister)|John Wilbur]], who was expelled from his yearly meeting in 1842. He and his supporters formed their own Conservative Friends Yearly Meeting. In the UK in 1868 some Friends broke away from [[London Yearly Meeting]] for the same reason. They formed a separate body of Friends called [[Britain Yearly Meeting#Fritchley General Meeting|Fritchley General Meeting]], which remained distinct and separate from London Yearly Meeting until 1968. Similar Christian splits took place in Canada. The Yearly Meetings that supported John Wilbur's religious beliefs were known as ''Conservative'' Friends.\n\n===Richmond Declaration===\nIn 1887, a Gurneyite Quaker of British descent, [[Joseph Bevan Braithwaite]], proposed to Friends a statement of faith known as the [[Richmond Declaration]]. This statement of faith was agreed to by 95 of the representatives at a meeting of [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]] Friends, but unexpectedly the Richmond Declaration was not adopted by London Yearly Meeting because a vocal minority, including [[Edward Grubb (Quaker)|Edward Grubb]], opposed it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Thomas C.|title=British Quakerism 1860\u20131920: The Transformation of a Religious Community|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n===Missions to Asia and Africa===\n[[File:BrummanaMissionHouse.jpg|thumb|Friends' Syrian Mission, 1874, built this mission house in [[Ramallah]]]]\nFollowing the [[Christian revival]]s in the mid-19th century, Friends in Great Britain wanted to start missionary activity overseas.

In Great Britain, they organised [[Woodbrooke College]] in 1903. In Kenya, Quakers founded Friends Bible Institute (now Friends Theological College) in [[Kaimosi]], [[Kenya]], in 1942.\n\n===Friends and slavery===\nSome Quakers in America and Britain became known for their involvement in the abolitionist movement. But until the [[American Revolutionary War]], it was fairly common for [[History of slavery in Pennsylvania#British colony|Friends]] in [[Colonial America]] to own slaves. During the early to mid-1700s, disquiet about this practice arose among Friends, best exemplified by the testimonies of [[Benjamin Lay]], [[Anthony Benezet]] and [[John Woolman]], and this resulted in an abolition movement among Friends. By the beginning of the American Revolution few Friends owned slaves. At the war's end in 1783, Yarnall family members along with fellow Meeting House Friends made a failed petition to the [[Continental Congress]] to abolish [[slavery in the United States]]. In 1790, the Society of Friends petitioned the [[United States Congress]] to abolish slavery, resulting in them being the first organization to take a collective stand against slavery and the slave trade.\n\nOne example of a reversal in sentiment about slavery took place in the life of [[Moses Brown]], one of four Rhode Island brothers who, in 1764, organized and funded the tragic and fateful voyage of the [[slave ship]] ''Sally''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/sally/|title=Voyage of the Slave Ship Sally}}</ref> Brown broke away from his three brothers, became an abolitionist, and converted to Christian Quakerism.

Tolerance of dissent widely varies among yearly meetings.<ref name=QWRC-intro/> Most Friends believe in [[continuing revelation]]: that God continuously reveals truth directly to individuals. George Fox, an \"[[Valiant Sixty|early Friend]]\", said, \"Christ has come to teach His people Himself.\"<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/> Friends often focus on trying to hear God. As [[Isaac Penington (Quaker)|Isaac Penington]] wrote in 1670, \"It is not enough to hear of Christ, or read of Christ, but this is the thing\u2014to feel him to be my root, my life, and my foundation...\"<ref name=PeningtonLetter/> Quakers reject the idea of [[priest]]s, believing in the [[priesthood of all believers]]. Some express their concept of God using phrases such as \"the inner light\", \"inward light of Christ\", or \"Holy Spirit\".\n{{See also|Friends United Meeting|Evangelical Friends Church International|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|}}\n\nDiverse theological beliefs, understandings of the \"leading of the Holy Spirit\", and statements of \"faith and practice\" have always existed among Friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.quakermaps.com/info|title=A Brief Introduction to Quakerism|date=30 January 2010|work=QuakerMaps.com (Beta)|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref> Due in part to the emphasis on the immediate guidance of the Holy Spirit, Quaker doctrines have only sometimes been codified as statements of faith, confessions or theological texts; those that do exist include the ''Letter to the Governor of Barbados'' ([[George Fox|Fox]], 1671),<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first=George|title=Letter to the Governor of Barbadoes|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/barbados.shtml}}</ref> ''An Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' ([[Robert Barclay|Barclay]], 1678),<ref>{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Robert|title=An Apology for the True Christian Divinity|year=1678|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/}}</ref> ''A Catechism and Confession of Faith'' ([[Robert Barclay|Barclay]], 1690),<ref>{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Robert|title=A Catechism and Confession of Faith|year=1690|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/catechism/index.html}}</ref> ''The Testimony of the Society of Friends on the Continent of America'' (adopted jointly by all [[Friends United Meeting|orthodox yearly meetings]] in U.S., 1830),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Testimony of the Society of Friends on the Continent of America|year=1830|publisher=Richard and George S Wood|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtctAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> the ''[[Richmond Declaration|Richmond Declaration of Faith]]'' (adopted by [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], 1887),<ref>{{cite web|title=Richmond Declaration of Faith|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/rdf.shtml|publisher=QuakerInfo.com}}</ref> and ''Essential Truths'' ([[Rufus Jones (writer)|Jones]] and Wood, adopted by [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], 1922).<ref>{{cite web|title=Essential Truths|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/esstruth.shtml|publisher=QuakerInfo.com}}</ref> As a public statement of faith, most yearly meetings publish their own [[Book of Discipline (Quaker)|Book of Discipline]], which expresses Christian discipleship within the experience of Friends in that yearly meeting.\n\n===Conservative===\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 064 - Quakers' Meeting (tone).jpg|thumb|alt=|Conservative Friends worshipping in London in 1809.

Many Wilburites see themselves as the Quakers whose beliefs are truest to original Quaker doctrine, arguing that the majority of Friends \"broke away\" from the Wilburites in the 19th and 20th centuries (rather than vice versa). Conservative Friends place their trust in the immediate guidance of God.<ref name=quakerfinder/> They completely reject all forms of [[religious symbolism]] and outward [[sacraments]], such as the [[Eucharist]] and [[water baptism]]. Conservative Friends do not believe in relying upon the practice of outward rites and sacraments, to have a living relationship with God through Christ; believing that holiness can exist in all of the activities of one's daily life\u2014and that all of life is sacred in God. Many Conservative Friends believe that a meal held with others can become a form of [[Communion (Christianity)|communion]] with God, and with one another.\n\nIn the U.S., Conservative Friends are part of three small Quaker Yearly Meetings in Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa; Ohio Yearly Meeting (Conservative) is generally considered to be the most Bible-centred of the three, retaining Christian Quakers who use plain language, wear plain dress, and live in small villages or rural areas more than the Conservative Friends from the other two Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings.<ref name=Wilburite-Gurneyite/>\n\nIn 2007, total membership of these Yearly Meetings was around 1642,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fwccamericas.org/find_friends/stats_by_country.shtml|title=FWCC Section of the Americas|website=fwccamericas.org|access-date=25 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419003049/http://fwccamericas.org/find_friends/stats_by_country.shtml|archive-date=19 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> making them around 0.4% of the world family of Quakers.\n\n===Evangelical===\n{{See also|Evangelical Friends Church International}}\n\n[[File:Old Camara 038.JPG|thumb|Phoenix Friends Church sign|Sign at entrance of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] Friends Church]]\nEvangelical Friends regard Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour,<ref name=quakerfinder/> and have similar religious beliefs to other [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians. They believe in, and hold a high regard for, the [[penal substitution]] of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ on the Cross at Calvary, [[biblical infallibility]], and the need for every person to personally experience a relationship with God.<ref name=\"Friends Beliefs\">{{cite web|last=Evangelical Friends Church International|title=Friends Beliefs|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/6}}</ref> They believe that the purpose of the Evangelical Friends Church is to evangelise the unsaved people of the world, to spiritually transform them through God's love and through social service to others.<ref name=\"Friends Beliefs\" /> Evangelical Friends regard the Bible as the infallible and self-authenticating Word of God. The statement of faith of [[Evangelical Friends International]] is comparable to the statement of faith of other Evangelical churches. Evangelical Friends who are members of Evangelical Friends International are mainly located in the U.S., Central America, and Asia. Beginning in the 1880s, some Friends began using outward sacraments in their Sunday services, first in Evangelical Friends Church\u2013Eastern Region (then known as Ohio Yearly Meeting [Damascus]). Friends Church\u2013Southwest Region has also approved the practice of using the outward sacraments in their Sunday services. In places where Evangelical Friends are engaged in missionary work, such as in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, adult baptism by immersion in water is carried out. This practice differs from most other Quaker branches of the Religious Society of Friends. {{As of|2014}}, EFCI claims to represent more than 140,000 Friends,<ref name=EFCI>{{cite web|title=Evangelical Friends Church International|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/}}</ref> roughly 39% of the total number of Friends worldwide.\n\n===Gurneyite===\n{{See also|Friends United Meeting}}\n\nGurneyite Friends (aka Friends United Meeting Friends) are the modern-day followers of the Evangelical Quaker theology first proclaimed by [[Joseph John Gurney]], a 19th-century British Friend. They make up 49% of the total number of Quakers worldwide.<ref name=QWRC-intro /> They regard Jesus Christ as their Teacher and Lord,<ref name=quakerfinder/> and favour working closely with other Protestant Christian churches. Gurneyite Friends balance the authority of the Bible as inspired words of God with personal and direct experience of God in their lives. Both children and adults participate in ongoing religious education which emphasises orthodox Christian teaching from the Bible, and in relationship to both orthodox Christian Quaker history and Quaker testimonies. Gurneyite Friends subscribe to a set of orthodox Christian doctrines, such as those found in the [[Richmond Declaration]] of faith. In subsequent years, conflict arose among Gurneyite Friends in relation to the Richmond Declaration of faith. Thus, after a while, the Richmond Declaration of faith was adopted by nearly all of the Gurneyite yearly meetings. The Five Years Meeting of Friends reaffirmed their loyalty to the Richmond Declaration of faith in 1912, but specifically stated that it was not to constitute a Christian creed. Although Gurneyism was the main form of Quakerism in Great Britain in the 19th century, Gurneyite Friends today are in America, Ireland, Africa and India. Many Gurneyite Friends combine \"waiting worship\" (unprogrammed worship) with religious practices commonly found in other Protestant Christian churches, such as the reading of the Bible and the singing of Hymns. A small minority of Gurneyite Friends practice entirely unprogrammed worship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fum.org/quaker-life-local-meeting-directory/ |title=Quaker Life \u2013 Local Meeting Directory |publisher=Friends United Meeting |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112213838/http://fum.org/quaker-life-local-meeting-directory/ |archive-date=12 November 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Holiness===\n{{See also|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends}}\n\nHoliness Friends are heavily influenced by the [[Holiness movement]], in particular [[John Wesley]]'s doctrine of [[Christian perfection]], also called \"entire sanctification\". This doctrine states that loving God and humanity totally, as exemplified by Christ, enables believers to rid themselves of voluntary sin. This was a predominant view within Quakerism in the United Kingdom and United States in the 19th century, and it influenced other branches of Quakerism. Holiness Friends argue (leaning on writings that include George Fox's message of ''perfection'') that early Friends had the same understanding of holiness.<ref name=\"central\">{{cite web|last=Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|title=About Us|url=http://www.centralyearlymeetingoffriends.org/AboutUs.dsp|access-date=6 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205212906/http://www.centralyearlymeetingoffriends.org/AboutUs.dsp|archive-date=5 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nToday, while some Friends hold holiness beliefs within most yearly meetings, it is the predominant theological view of [[Central Yearly Meeting of Friends]], (founded in 1926 specifically to promote holiness theology) and the Holiness Mission of the Bolivian Evangelical Friends Church (founded by missionaries from that meeting in 1919, the largest group of Friends in Bolivia).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Margery Post Abbott|display-authors=etal|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-8108-7088-6|pages=327\u2013328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&pg=PA328&lpg=PA328&dq=Bolivian+Holiness+Mission+Evangelical+Friends+Church&source=bl&ots=_7cCaucsFV&sig=a53kHYYP5vfM8AEozXPzLiGzPrI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MOZsT6HYDqK-0QWIyM3CBg&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Bolivian%20Holiness%20Mission%20Evangelical%20Friends%20Church&f=false|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Liberal===\n{{See also|Friends General Conference|Britain Yearly Meeting|Beanite Quakerism|}}\n\nLiberal Quakerism generally refers to Friends who have taken ideas from liberal Christianity, often sharing a similar mix of ideas, such as more critical Biblical [[hermeneutics]], often with a focus on the [[social gospel]]. The ideas of ''That of God in everyone'' and the ''[[inner light]]'' were popularised by American Friend [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]] in the early 20th century. He and [[John Wilhelm Rowntree]] originated the movement. Liberal Friends were predominant in Great Britain in the 20th century, and among US meetings affiliated to [[Friends General Conference]]; and some meetings in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa.\n\nThese ideas remain an important part of liberal Friends' understanding of God. Liberal Friends highlight the importance of good works, particularly living a life that upholds the virtues preached by Jesus. They often emphasise pacifism, treating others equally, living simply and telling the truth.<ref name=QWRC-intro/>\n\nLike Conservative Friends, Liberal Friends reject [[religious symbolism]] and sacraments, such as water baptism and the Eucharist. While Liberal Friends recognise the potential of these outward forms for awakening experiences of the Inward [[Light of the World|Light]] of Christ, they are not part of their worship, and are believed unnecessary to authentic Christian spirituality.\n\nThe Bible remains central to most Liberal Friends' worship, and almost all meetings make it available in the [[Friends Meeting House|meeting house]], (often on a table in the centre of the room), which attendees may read privately or publicly during worship. But Liberal Friends decided that the Scriptures should give way to God's leading, if God leads them in a way that is contrary to the Bible. Many Friends are also influenced by liberal Christian theologians, and modern [[Biblical criticism]]. They often adopt non-propositional Biblical hermeneutics, such as believing that the Bible is an anthology of human authors' beliefs and feelings about God, rather than Holy Writ, and that multiple interpretations of the Scriptures are acceptable.\n\nLiberal Friends believe that a corporate confession of faith would be an obstacle\u2014both to authentic listening and to new insight. As a non-creedal form of Christianity, Liberal Quakerism is receptive to a wide range of religious faith understandings. Most Liberal Quaker Yearly Meetings publish a [[Book of Discipline (Quaker)|Faith and Practice]], a book with a range of religious experiences of what it means to be a Friend in that Yearly Meeting.\n\n===Universalist===\n{{main| Quaker Universalist Fellowship}}\nUniversalist Friends affirm [[religious pluralism]], that there are many different paths to God and that understandings of the divine reached through non-Christian religious experiences are as valid as Christian understandings. This group was founded in the late 1970s by John Linton. Linton had worshipped God with the Delhi Worship Group in India (an independent meeting not affiliated to any yearly meeting or wider Quaker group) with Christians, Muslims and Hindus worshipping together.<ref name=\"Universalist History\">{{cite journal|last=Rickermann|first=Sally|title=Quaker Universalist Fellowship: Its History|journal=Journal of the Quaker Universalist Fellowship|year=2007|issue=46|url=http://www.universalistfriends.org/uf046.html#Rickerman}}</ref>\nFollowing a move to Great Britain, he founded the [[Quaker Universalist Fellowship]] in 1978. Later his views spread to the US, where the Quaker Universalist Fellowship was founded in 1983.<ref name=\"Universalist History\" /> Most of the Friends who joined these two fellowships were Liberal Friends from Britain Yearly Meeting in the United Kingdom, and Liberal Friends from Friends General Conference in the United States. Interest in Quaker Universalism is low among Friends from other Yearly meetings. The views of the Universalists provoked controversy{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} between themselves and Christian Quakers within Britain Yearly Meeting, and within Friends General Conference, during the 1980s. Despite the label, Quaker \"Universalists\" are not necessarily [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]], embracing the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]].\n\n===Non-theist===\n{{main|Nontheist Quakers}}\n\nThese Friends have views similar to other post-Christian non-theists in other churches such as the [[Sea of Faith]] that emerged from the [[Anglican]] church. They are predominantly atheists, agnostics, and humanists who nevertheless value membership in a religious organization. The first organisation for non-theist Friends was the ''Humanistic Society of Friends'', founded in Los Angeles in 1939. This organisation remained small and was absorbed into the [[American Humanist Association]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cresson|first=Os|title=Roots and Flowers of Quaker Nontheism|url=http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/roots-and-flowers-of-quaker-nontheism-2/|access-date=6 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209104940/http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/roots-and-flowers-of-quaker-nontheism-2/|archive-date=9 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> More recently, interest in non-theism resurfaced, particularly led by British Friend [[David Boulton (UK journalist)|David Boulton]], who founded the 40-member ''Nontheist Friends Network'' in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Nontheist Friends Network in Britain|url=http://www.nontheistfriends.org/article/new-nontheist-friends-network-in-britain/|publisher=nontheistfriends.org}}</ref> Non-theism is controversial, leading some Christian Quakers from within Britain Yearly Meeting to call for non-theists to be refused membership.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heathfield|first=D|title=Non-theist Friends Network|journal=The Friend|date=27 May 2011|volume=169|issue=21|url=http://thefriend.org/article/letters-27-may-2011/}}</ref>\nIn one study of Friends in [[Britain Yearly Meeting]], around 30% of Quakers had views that were described as [[non-theism|non-theistic]], [[agnostic]], or [[atheist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dandelion |first=Pink |title=A Sociological Analysis of the Theology of Quakers: The Silent Revolution |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |location=Lewiston, NY |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Heron |first=Alistair |title=Caring, Conviction, Commitment: Dilemmas of Quaker Membership Today |publisher=Quaker Home Service |location=London |year=1992}}</ref> Another study of British Quakers found that of the 727 members of the Religious Society of Friends who completed the survey, 75.1% said that they consider themselves to be Christian; 17.6% did not consider themselves Christian; and 7.3% of the members either did not answer or circled both answers.<ref name=Mellor/>{{rp|p.41}} A further 22% of Quakers did not consider themselves to be Christian, but fulfilled a definition of being a Christian in that they said that they devoutly followed the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.<ref name=Mellor/>{{rp|p.52}} In the same survey 86.9% said that they believed in God.<ref name=Mellor>{{cite thesis |last=Mellor |first=Katherine |title=Christian Belief in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers): a Response to the Claim That British Friends Are Post-Christian |type=M.Phil. |year=2009 |publisher=University of Birmingham |url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/682/1/Mellor10MPhil.pdf |pages=39\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Practical theology==\n[[File:1688 germantown petition table.jpg|alt=|thumb|In 1688, at this table in [[Germantown, Philadelphia]], Quakers and [[Mennonites]] signed a common declaration denouncing slavery]]\nQuakers bear witness or ''[[Religious testimony|testify]]'' to their religious beliefs in their spiritual lives,<ref name=QuakerTestimonies2005/> drawing on the [[Epistle of James|James]] advice that ''faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead''.<ref name=James>{{bibleverse|James|2:17|NIV}}</ref> This religious witness is rooted in their immediate experience of God and verified by the Bible, especially in Jesus Christ's life and teachings. They may bear witness in many ways, according to how they believe God is leading them. Although Quakers share how they relate to God and the world, mirroring Christian ethical codes, for example the [[Sermon on the Mount]] or the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Friends argue that they feel personally moved by God rather than following an ethical code.\n\nSome theologians classify Friends' religious witness into categories\u2014known by some Friends as ''testimonies.'' These Friends believe these principles and practices testify to, witness to, or provide evidence for God's truth.

Rocky Mountain Yearly Meeting Friends put their faith in action through living their lives by the following principles: prayer, personal integrity, stewardship (which includes giving away minimum of 10% income and refraining from lotteries), marriage and family (lifelong commitment), regard for mind and body (refraining from certain amusements, propriety and modesty of dress, abstinence from alcohol, tobacco and drugs), peace and non-violence (including refusing to participate in war), abortion (opposition to abortion, practical ministry to women with unwanted pregnancy and promotion of adoption), human sexuality, the Christian and state (look to God for authority, not the government), capital punishment (find alternatives), human equality, women in ministry (recognising women and men have an equal part to play in ministry).<ref>Rocky Mountain Yearly Meeting of the Friends Church (1997) \"[http://www.rmym.org/Faith_And_Practice_Print.php The Faith and Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627173003/http://www.rmym.org/Faith_And_Practice_Print.php |date=27 June 2012 }}\"</ref>\nThe Southern Appalachian Yearly Meeting and Association lists as testimonies: Integrity, Peace, Simplicity, Equality and Community; Areas of witness lists Children, Education, Government, Sexuality and Harmony with Nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sayma.org/online_documents/faith_and_practice/F&P2012final.pdf |title=Testifying to the Life of the SPIRIT |author=Southern Appalachian Yearly Meeting and Association |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the acronym STEP or PEST is used (peace, equality, simplicity and truth).

This does not use names of calendar units derived from the names of pagan deities. The days begin with First Day (Sunday) and ends on Seventh Day (Saturday), and months run from First Month (January) to Twelfth Month (December). This is based on the terms used in the Bible: e.g., Jesus Christ's followers went to the tomb early on the First Day of the week.<ref>{{bibleverse|Mark|16:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Luke|24:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|John|20:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|John|20:19|NIV}}</ref> The plain calendar emerged in the 17th century in England in the [[Puritan]] movement, but became closely identified with Friends by the end of the 1650s, and was commonly employed into the 20th century. It is less commonly encountered today. The term ''First Day School'' is commonly used, for what is called by most churches ''Sunday School.''\n\nIn common with other Christian denominations derived from the 16th century [[Puritanism]], many Friends do not observe religious festivals (e.g. [[Christmas]], [[Lent]], or [[Easter]]), but instead believe that Christ's birth, [[crucifixion]], and [[resurrection]], should be commemorated every day of the year. For example, many Quakers feel that [[fasting]] at [[Lent]], but then eating in excess at other times of the year is [[hypocrisy]] and therefore many Quakers, rather than observing Lent, live a simple lifestyle all the year round (''see [[testimony of simplicity]]''). These practices are often referred to as the ''testimony against times and seasons.''\n\nSome Friends are non-Sabbatarians, holding that \"every day is the Lord's day\", and that what should be done on a First Day should be done every day of the week, although Meeting for Worship is usually held on a First Day, following the advice first issued by elders in 1656.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dewsbury|first1=William|last2=Farnworth|first2=Richard|title=The Epistle from the Elders at Balby, 1656|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/balby.html}}</ref>\n\n==Worship==\n{{See also|Meeting for worship}}\nMost groups of Quakers meet for regular worship. There are two main types of worship worldwide: programmed worship and waiting worship.\n\n===Programmed worship===\n{{See also|Friends United Meeting|Evangelical Friends Church International|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|}}\n[[File:West Mansfield Friends Church.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|West Mansfield Friends Church, Ohio, affiliated with the [[Evangelical Friends Church International]]]]\nIn ''programmed worship'' there is often a prepared Biblical message, which may be delivered by an individual with theological training from a Bible College. There may be hymns, a sermon, Bible readings, joint prayers and a period of silent worship. The worship resembles the [[church service]]s of other [[Protestant]] denominations, although in most cases does not include the Eucharist. A paid pastor may be responsible for [[pastoral care]]. Worship of this kind is celebrated by about 89% of Friends worldwide.<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5\u20136}} It is found in many Yearly Meetings in Africa, Asia and parts of the US (central and southern), and is common in programmed meetings affiliated to [[Friends United Meeting]], (who make up around 49% of worldwide membership<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5}}), and evangelical meetings, including those affiliated to [[Evangelical Friends International]], (who make up at least 40% of Friends worldwide<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5\u20136}}). The religious event is sometimes called a Quaker [[meeting for worship]] or sometimes called a Friends church service. This religious tradition arose among Friends in the United States, in the 19th century, and in response to the many converts to Christian Quakerism during the national [[Great awakening|spiritual revival]] of the time. Friends meetings in Africa and Latin America were generally started by Orthodox Friends from programmed elements of the Society, therefore most African and Latin American Friends worship in a programmed style.\n\nSome Friends also hold \"Semi-Programmed\" Worship, which brings programmed elements such as hymns and readings into an otherwise unprogrammed worship service.\n\n===Unprogrammed worship===\n{{See also|Conservative Friends|Friends General Conference|Britain Yearly Meeting|Beanite Quakerism|}}\n{{external media | float = right | headerimage= [[File:Race Street Friends Meeting House, Race Street west of Fifteenth Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA HABS PA-6687-13.jpg|frameless]]\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxjH4sa2RFI What to Expect in Quaker Meeting for Worship], QuakerSpeak<ref name=\"qs\">{{cite web | title =What to Expect in Quaker Meeting for Worship | publisher =QuakerSpeak | date = 20 November 2014 | url =http://quakerspeak.com/what-to-expect-quaker-meeting-worship/ | accessdate =25 April 2016 }}</ref> }}\n\n''Unprogrammed worship'' (also known as ''waiting worship'', \"silent worship\", or ''holy communion in the manner of Friends)'' is based on the practices of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in \"expectant waiting upon God\" to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of (\"[[Christian ministry|vocal ministry]]\") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the [[Elder (Christianity)#Quakers (Religious Society of Friends)|elders]]) exchange the [[sign of peace]] by [[handshake]]. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with [[Friends General Conference]] and [[Beanite Quakerism]])\u2014constituting about 11%<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page 5}} of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing [[Light of the World|the light]] of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, [[Recorded Minister]]s were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among ''Conservative'' Friends and ''Liberal Friends'' (e.g. [[New York Yearly Meeting]]<ref>{{cite web|last=New York Yearly Meeting|title=Formal Guidelines from New York Yearly Meeting's Faith and Practice|url=http://www.nyym.org/index.php?q=node/252}}</ref>). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. [[London Yearly Meeting]] of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of [[Recorded Minister]]s in 1924.\n\n==Governance and organisation==\n\n===Organizational government and polity===\n<!-- [[Meeting for Business]] redirects to this section -->\n[[File:Meeting in York.JPG|alt=|thumb|Quaker Business Meeting in [[York]]]]\n[[Ecclesiastical polity|Governance]] and decision making is conducted at a special meeting for worship\u2014often called a ''meeting for worship with a concern for business'' or ''meeting for worship for church affairs'' at which all members can attend, as in a [[Congregationalist polity|Congregational]] church. Quakers consider this to be a form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who ''wait upon the Lord'' to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.<ref name=QuakersinScotland/>\n\nAs in a ''meeting for worship'', each member is expected to listen to God, and, if led by Him, stand up and contribute. In some business meetings, Friends wait for the [[Clerk (Quaker)|clerk]] to acknowledge them before speaking. Direct replies to someone's contribution are not permitted, with an aim of seeking truth rather than of debating. A decision is reached when the meeting, as a whole, feels that the \"way forward\" has been discerned (also called \"coming to unity\"). There is no voting. On some occasions Friends may delay a decision because they feel the meeting is not following God's will. Others (especially non-Friends) may describe this as [[consensus decision-making]]; however in general Friends continue to seek God's will. It is assumed that, if everyone is attuned to God's spirit, the way forward will become clear.\n\n===International organization===\n{{Main|Friends World Committee for Consultation}}\n[[Friends World Committee for Consultation]] (FWCC) is the international Quaker organization that loosely unifies the different religious traditions of Quakers; FWCC brings together the largest variety of Friends in the world. Friends World Committee for Consultation is divided into four sections to represent different regions of the world: Africa, Asia West Pacific, Europe and Middle East, and the Americas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nVarious organizations associated with Friends include a U.S. lobbying organization based in [[Washington, D.C.]] called the [[Friends Committee on National Legislation]] (FCNL); service organizations such as the [[American Friends Service Committee]] (AFSC), the [[Quaker United Nations Office]]s, [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]], Friends Committee on Scouting, the Quaker Peace Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, and the [[Alternatives to Violence Project]].\n\n===Yearly meetings===\n{{Main|Yearly Meeting}}\nQuakers today are organised into independent and regional, national bodies called [[Yearly Meetings]], which have often split from one another because of Christian [[doctrinal]] differences. Several associations unite Quakers who share similar religious beliefs\u2014for example [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] unites [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian Friends]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Friends Beliefs|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/6|publisher=Evangelical Friends Church International}}</ref> [[Friends United Meeting]] unites Friends into \"fellowships where Jesus Christ is known, loved, and obeyed as Teacher and Lord;\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Friends United Meeting \u2013 About Us |url=http://fum.org:80/about-us/ |publisher=Friends United Meeting |accessdate=5 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228204503/http://fum.org/about-us/ |archivedate=28 February 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and [[Friends General Conference]] links together Quakers that have non-creedal, liberal religious beliefs. Many Quaker [[Yearly Meeting]]s, are also members of [[Friends World Committee for Consultation]], an international fellowship of Yearly Meetings from different Quaker religious traditions.\n\n===Membership===\nA Friend is a member of a Yearly Meeting, usually beginning with membership in a local monthly meeting. Methods for acquiring membership vary; for example, in most Kenyan yearly meetings, attenders who wish to become members are required to take part in around two years of adult education, memorising key Bible passages, and learning about the history of orthodox Christianity, and of Christian Quakerism. Within Britain Yearly Meeting, membership is acquired through a process of [[peer review]], where a potential member is visited by several members who present a report to the other members of the monthly meeting before a decision is reached.\n\nWithin some Friends Churches in the Evangelical Friends Church, in particular in Rwanda, Burundi, and parts of the U.S., an adult believer's baptism by immersion in water, is optional. Within Liberal Friends, Conservative Friends, and Pastoral Friends Churches, Friends do not practise [[baptism|water baptism]], [[infant baptism|Christening]], or other initiation ceremonies to admit a new member or a newborn baby. Children are often welcomed into the meeting at their first attendance. Formerly, children born to Quaker parents automatically became members (sometimes called ''Birthright membership''), but this is no longer the case in many areas. Some parents apply for membership on behalf of their children, while others allow the child to decide whether to become a member when they are ready, and older in age. Some meetings adopt a policy that children, some time after becoming young adults, must apply independently for membership.\n\n==Meetings for worship for specific tasks==\n\n===Memorial services===\n[[File:George Fox marker Bunhill Fields.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Quaker testimony of simplicity extends to memorialisation as well. Founder George Fox is remembered with a simple grave marker at [[Quaker Gardens, Islington]].]]\nTraditional Quaker memorial services are held as a form of worship and are known as memorial meetings. Friends gather for worship and offer remembrances about the deceased. In some Quaker religious traditions, the coffin or ashes are not present. Memorial meetings may be held many weeks after the death, which can enable wider attendance, and can also replace grief with spiritual reflection, and celebration of life to dominate. Memorial meetings can last over an hour, particularly if many people attend. Memorial services give everyone a chance to remember the lost individual in their own way, comforting those present, and re-affirming the love of the people in the wider community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Marriage===\n{{Main|Quaker wedding}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\nA ''meeting for worship for the solemnisation of marriage'' in an unprogrammed Friends meeting is similar to any other unprogrammed Meeting for Worship.<ref name=QinGB/> The pair exchange vows before God and gathered witnesses, and the meeting returns to open worship. At the rise of meeting, the witnesses, including the youngest children, are asked to sign the wedding certificate as a record. In Great Britain, Quakers keep a separate record of the union and notify the [[General Register Office]].\n\nIn the early days of the United States, there was doubt whether a marriage solemnised in that manner was entitled to legal recognition. Over the years, each state has set rules for the procedure. Most US states expect the marriage document to be signed by a single officiant (a priest, rabbi, minister, Justice of the Peace, etc.). Quakers routinely modify the document to allow three or four Friends to sign as the officiant. Often, these are the members of a committee of ministry and oversight, who have helped the couple plan their marriage. Usually, a separate document containing their vows and the signatures of all present is kept by the couple, and often displayed prominently in their home.\n\nIn many Friends meetings, the couple meet with a [[clearness committee]] prior to the wedding. This committee's purpose is to discuss with the couple the many aspects of marriage and life as a couple. If the couple seems ready, the marriage is recommended to the meeting.\n\nAs in the wider society, there is a wide diversity of views on the issue of [[same-sex marriage]], and Friends have varying views on the topic. Various Friends meetings around the world have voiced support for, and have recognised, same-sex marriages. In 1986, Hartford Friends Meeting in Connecticut, U.S., reached the decision that \"the Meeting recognised a committed union in a celebration of marriage, under the care of the Meeting. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both homosexual and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice.\"<ref name=\"religioustolerance.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_quak.htm|title=The Society of Friends (Quakers) and Homosexuality|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> Since then, some other meetings of liberal and progressive Friends from Australia, Britain, New Zealand, parts of North America, and other countries have recognised marriage between partners of the same sex. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage is not recognised by the civil authorities, some meetings follow the practice of early Quakers in overseeing the union without reference to the state. There are also Friends who do not support same-sex marriage, and some Evangelical and Pastoral yearly meetings in the United States have issued public statements stating that homosexuality is a sin.<ref name=\"religioustolerance.org\"/>\n\n==National and international divisions and organisation==\nLike many religious movements, the Religious Society of Friends has evolved, changed, and split into subgroups.\n\nQuakerism started in England and Wales, and quickly spread to Ireland, the Netherlands,<ref name=Netherlands /> Barbados<ref name=Barbados /> and North America.

In 1910 this community built the Ramallah Friends Meetinghouse and later added another building that was used for community outreach.\n\nThe Ramallah Friends Meeting has always played a vital role in the community. In 1948 the buildings and grounds became the home to many Palestinian refugees. Throughout the years, the members of the Ramallah Friends Meeting organised numerous community programmes such as the Children's Play Centre, the First Day School, and women's activities.\n\nBy the early 1990s the Meetinghouse and Annex, which housed meeting rooms and bathroom facilities, fell into disrepair as a result of damage inflicted by time and impact of conflict. So serious was the deterioration of the meetinghouse that by the middle 1990s it was impossible to use the building at all.\n\nA further blow to the Friends and the wider Palestinian community was the high level of emigration brought on by the economic situation and the hardships arising from the continuing Israeli military occupation. The Meetinghouse, which had served as a place of worship for the Friends in Ramallah could no longer be used as such and the Annex could no longer be used for community outreach.\n\nIn 2002 a committee consisting of members of the Religious Society of Friends in the US and the Clerk of the Ramallah Meeting began to raise funds for the renovations of the buildings and grounds of the Meetinghouse. By November 2004 the renovations were complete, and on 6 March 2005, exactly 95 years to the day after the dedication, the Meetinghouse and Annex were rededicated as a Quaker and community resource.\n\nFriends meet every Sunday morning at 10:30&nbsp;a.m. for unprogrammed Meeting for Worship.

The reference to \"monthly\" is because the meeting meets monthly to conduct the group's business. Most \"monthly meetings\" meet for worship at least once a week; some meetings have several worship meetings during the week. In programmed traditions, local congregations are often referred to as \"Friends Churches\" or \"Meetings\".\n\nMonthly meetings are often part of a regional group called a ''quarterly meeting'', which is usually part of an even larger group called a ''yearly meeting;'' with the adjectives \"quarterly\" and \"yearly\" referring specifically to the frequency of ''meetings for worship with a concern for business''.\n\nSome yearly meetings, like Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, belong to larger organisations to help maintain order and communication within the Society. The three chief ones are [[Friends General Conference]] (FGC), [[Friends United Meeting]] (FUM), and [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] (EFCI). In all three groups, most member organisations, though not necessarily members are from the United States. FGC is theologically the most liberal of the three groups, while EFCI is the most evangelical. FUM is the largest. [[Friends United Meeting]] was originally known as \"Five Years Meeting\". Some monthly meetings belong to more than one larger organisation, while others are fully independent.\n{{Clear right}}\n\n==Relations with other churches and faiths==\n===Ecumenical relations===\nMany Quakers prior to the 20th century considered the Religious Society of Friends to be a Christian movement, but did not feel that their religious faith fit within the categories of [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<ref name=BBCreligion&ethics/> Many Conservative Friends, while fully seeing themselves as orthodox Christians, choose to remain separate from other Christian groups.\n\nMany Friends in Liberal Friends' meetings are actively involved in the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]], often working closely with other [[Mainline Protestant]] and liberal Christian churches, with whom they share common religious ground. A concern for peace and social justice often brings Friends together with other Christian churches and other Christian groups. Some Liberal Quaker yearly meetings are members of ecumenical pan-Christian organisations, which include Protestant, Orthodox, and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches\u2014for example [[Philadelphia Yearly Meeting]] is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]].<ref name=\"ncccusa1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html |title=Members of the National Council of Churches |publisher=Ncccusa.org |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125143317/http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html |archivedate=25 November 2011  }}</ref> [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] is a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and [[Friends General Conference]] is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]].<ref name=\"oikoumene1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-families/friends-quakers.html |title=Friends (Quakers) |publisher=Oikoumene.org |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104180955/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-families/friends-quakers.html |archivedate=4 November 2011  }}</ref>\n\nGuerneyite Friends would typically see themselves as part of an orthodox Christian movement and work closely with other Christian groups.

The North American branch of [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] is a member church of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]]. Evangelical Friends tend to be less involved with non-evangelical churches and are not members of the [[World Council of Churches]] or [[National Council of Churches]].\n\nThe majority of other Christian groups recognise Friends among their fellow-Christians.<ref name=BBCreligion&ethics/> Some people who attend Quaker Meetings assume that Quakers are not Christians, when they do not hear overtly Christian language during the meeting for worship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/18/quaker-religion-jesus-christianity |title=If Quakers were more Christian |work=The Guardian |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Relations with other faiths===\nRelationships between Quakers and non-Christians vary considerably, according to sect, geography, and history.\n\nEarly Quakers distanced themselves from practices that they saw as [[Paganism|pagan]], such as refusing to use the usual names of the days of the week, since they were derived from the names of pagan deities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yount|first=David|title=How the Quakers invented America|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|isbn=0-7425-5833-9|page=11}}</ref> They refused to celebrate [[Christmas]] because they believed it was based on pagan festivities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Jerry William|title=The Quaker family in colonial America: a social history of the Society of Friends, Volume 2|year=1968|publisher=University of Wisconsin|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=436}}</ref>\n\nEarly Friends attempted to convert adherents of other world religions to Christianity.

''An Introduction to Quakerism'' ({{ISBN|0521841119}}), page 78.</ref> Later, in the 19th century, there was a diversification of theological beliefs in the Religious Society of Friends, and this led to several larger splits within the Quaker movement.\n\n====Hicksite\u2013Orthodox split====\nThe Hicksite\u2013Orthodox split arose out of both ideological and socioeconomic tensions. Philadelphia Yearly Meeting Hicksites tended to be agrarian and poorer than the more urban, wealthier, Orthodox Quakers. With increasing financial success, Orthodox Quakers wanted to \"make the Society a more respectable body\u2014to transform their sect into a church\u2014by adopting mainstream Protestant orthodoxy\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Glenn|title=Quakers Living in the Lion's Mouth: The Society of Friends in Northern Virginia, 1730\u20131865|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville|pages=145}}</ref> Hicksites, though they held a variety of views, generally saw the market economy as corrupting, and believed Orthodox Quakers had sacrificed their orthodox Christian spirituality for material success. Hicksites viewed the Bible as secondary to the individual cultivation of God's light within.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crothers|first=Glenn|title=Quakers Living in the Lion's Mouth|pages=145}}</ref>\n\nWith Gurneyite Quakers' shift toward Protestant principles and away from the spiritualisation of human relations, women's role as promoters of \"holy conversation\" started to decrease. Conversely, within the Hicksite movement the rejection of the market economy and the continuing focus on community and family bonds tended to encourage women to retain their role as powerful arbiters.\n\n[[Elias Hicks]]' religious views were claimed to be [[universalist]] and to contradict Quakers' historical orthodox Christian beliefs and practices. Hicks' Gospel preaching and teaching precipitated the ''Great Separation'' of 1827, which resulted in a parallel system of Yearly Meetings in America, joined by Friends from Philadelphia, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Baltimore. They were referred to by their opponents as ''Hicksites'' and by others, and sometimes themselves, as ''orthodox''. Quakers in Great Britain recognised only the ''Orthodox'' Quakers and refused to correspond with the ''Hicksites.''\n\n====Beaconite controversy====\n[[Isaac Crewdson]] was a [[Recorded Minister]] in [[Manchester]], UK. His 1835 book ''A Beacon to the Society of Friends'' strongly argued that the inner light was at odds with a religious belief in [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] by the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ.<ref name=Bebbington>{{cite book|last=Bebbington|first=David William|title=Evangelicalism in modern Britain: a history from the 1730s to the 1980s|url=https://archive.org/details/evangelicalismin0000bebb|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Ltd|location=London |isbn=0-415-10464-5}}</ref>{{rp|page=155}} This Christian controversy led to Crewdson's resignation from the Religious Society of Friends, along with 48 fellow members of Manchester Meeting and about 250 other British Quakers in 1836\u201337.

This movement was led by British Quaker [[Joseph John Gurney]]. Christian Friends held [[Revival meeting]]s in America and became involved in the [[Holiness movement]] of churches.

Many eventually collectively became the Five Years Meeting and then [[Friends United Meeting]], although [[London Yearly Meeting]], which had been strongly Gurneyite in the 19th century, did not join either of these groups. These Quaker yearly meetings make up the largest proportion of Quakers in the world today.\n\nSome ''orthodox'' Quakers in America disliked the move towards evangelical Christianity and saw it as a dilution of Friends' traditional orthodox Christian belief in being inwardly led by the [[Holy Spirit]]. These Friends were led by [[John Wilbur (Quaker minister)|John Wilbur]], who was expelled from his yearly meeting in 1842. He and his supporters formed their own Conservative Friends Yearly Meeting. In the UK in 1868 some Friends broke away from [[London Yearly Meeting]] for the same reason. They formed a separate body of Friends called [[Britain Yearly Meeting#Fritchley General Meeting|Fritchley General Meeting]], which remained distinct and separate from London Yearly Meeting until 1968. Similar Christian splits took place in Canada. The Yearly Meetings that supported John Wilbur's religious beliefs were known as ''Conservative'' Friends.\n\n===Richmond Declaration===\nIn 1887, a Gurneyite Quaker of British descent, [[Joseph Bevan Braithwaite]], proposed to Friends a statement of faith known as the [[Richmond Declaration]]. This statement of faith was agreed to by 95 of the representatives at a meeting of [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]] Friends, but unexpectedly the Richmond Declaration was not adopted by London Yearly Meeting because a vocal minority, including [[Edward Grubb (Quaker)|Edward Grubb]], opposed it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Thomas C.|title=British Quakerism 1860\u20131920: The Transformation of a Religious Community|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n===Missions to Asia and Africa===\n[[File:BrummanaMissionHouse.jpg|thumb|Friends' Syrian Mission, 1874, built this mission house in [[Ramallah]]]]\nFollowing the [[Christian revival]]s in the mid-19th century, Friends in Great Britain wanted to start missionary activity overseas.

In the early years of Quakerism, George Fox faced resistance in developing and establishing women's meetings. As controversy increased, Fox did not fully adhere to this agenda; for example, he established the London Six Weeks Meeting in 1671, as a regulatory body, led by 35 women and 49 men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mack|first1=Phyllis|title=VIsionary Women: Ecstatic Prophecy in Seventeenth-Century England|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=289}}</ref> Regardless, conflict culminated in the Wilkinson\u2013Story split, in which a portion of the Quaker community left to worship independently in protest of women's meetings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Janney|first=Samuel|title=History of the Religious Society of Friends, from its Rise to the Year 1828|url=https://archive.org/details/historyreligiou07janngoog|year=1861|publisher=Hayes & Zell|location=Philadelphia|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyreligiou07janngoog/page/n303 298]}}</ref> After several years, the schism became largely resolved, testifying to the resistance of some within the Quaker community, and to the spiritual role of women that Fox and Margaret Fell had encouraged. Also particularly within the relatively prosperous Quaker communities of the eastern United States, the focus on the child and \"holy conversation\" gave women unusual community power, although they were largely excluded from the market economy. With the Hicksite\u2013Orthodox split of 1827\u201328, Orthodox women found their spiritual role decreased, while Hicksite women retained greater influence.\n\n===Friends in business===\n[[File:John Cadbury.jpg|thumb|upright|English Quaker [[John Cadbury]] founded [[Cadbury]] in [[Birmingham]], England in 1824, selling tea, coffee and drinking chocolate.]]\nDescribed as \"natural capitalists\" by the [[BBC]], dynasties of Quakers were successful in business matters.<ref name=Jackson2010 /> This included ironmaking by [[Abraham Darby I]] (which played an important role in the [[Industrial Revolution]] that commenced in Britain),<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |work=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Quaker Enterprise\">{{cite book |last=Burns Windsor |first=D |year=1980 |title=The Quaker Enterprise: Friends in Business |publisher=Frederick Muller Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-584-10257-7}}</ref> and [[Abraham Darby (disambiguation)|his family]]; banking, including [[Lloyds Banking Group]] (founded by [[Sampson Lloyd]]),<ref name=\"Quaker Enterprise\" /> [[Barclays PLC]],<ref name=\"Quaker Enterprise\" /> [[Backhouse's Bank]] and [[Gurney's Bank]]; life assurance ([[Friends Provident]]); pharmaceuticals ([[Allen & Hanburys]]<ref name=\"Quaker Enterprise\" />); chocolate ([[Cadbury]],<ref name=\"Quaker Enterprise\" /> [[Terry's]], [[J.

This evolved to become the charity [[Oxfam]].\n\n===Friends in education===\nInitially, Quakers had no ordained [[clergy]], and thus needed no [[seminary|seminaries]] for theological training.

In Great Britain, they organised [[Woodbrooke College]] in 1903. In Kenya, Quakers founded Friends Bible Institute (now Friends Theological College) in [[Kaimosi]], [[Kenya]], in 1942.\n\n===Friends and slavery===\nSome Quakers in American and Britian became known for their involvement in the abolitionist movement. But until the [[American Revolutionary War]], it was fairly common for [[History of slavery in Pennsylvania#British colony|Friends]] in [[Colonial America]] to own slaves. During the early to mid-1700s, disquiet about this practice arose among Friends, best exemplified by the testimonies of [[Benjamin Lay]], [[Anthony Benezet]] and [[John Woolman]], and this resulted in an abolition movement among Friends. By the beginning of the American Revolution few Friends owned slaves. At the war's end in 1783, Yarnall family members along with fellow Meeting House Friends made a failed petition to the [[Continental Congress]] to abolish [[slavery in the United States]]. In 1790, the Society of Friends petitioned the [[United States Congress]] to abolish slavery, resulting in them being the first organization to take a collective stand against slavery and the slave trade.\n\nOne example of a reversal in sentiment about slavery took place in the life of [[Moses Brown]], one of four Rhode Island brothers who, in 1764, organized and funded the tragic and fateful voyage of the [[slave ship]] ''Sally''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/sally/|title=Voyage of the Slave Ship Sally}}</ref> Brown broke away from his three brothers, became an abolitionist, and converted to Christian Quakerism.

Tolerance of dissent widely varies among yearly meetings.<ref name=QWRC-intro/> Most Friends believe in [[continuing revelation]]: that God continuously reveals truth directly to individuals. George Fox, an \"[[Valiant Sixty|early Friend]]\", said, \"Christ has come to teach His people Himself.\"<ref name=GeorgeFoxsJournal/> Friends often focus on trying to hear God. As [[Isaac Penington (Quaker)|Isaac Penington]] wrote in 1670, \"It is not enough to hear of Christ, or read of Christ, but this is the thing\u2014to feel him to be my root, my life, and my foundation...\"<ref name=PeningtonLetter/> Quakers reject the idea of [[priest]]s, believing in the [[priesthood of all believers]]. Some express their concept of God using phrases such as \"the inner light\", \"inward light of Christ\", or \"Holy Spirit\".\n{{See also|Friends United Meeting|Evangelical Friends Church International|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|}}\n\nDiverse theological beliefs, understandings of the \"leading of the Holy Spirit\", and statements of \"faith and practice\" have always existed among Friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.quakermaps.com/info|title=A Brief Introduction to Quakerism|date=30 January 2010|work=QuakerMaps.com (Beta)|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref> Due in part to the emphasis on the immediate guidance of the Holy Spirit, Quaker doctrines have only sometimes been codified as statements of faith, confessions or theological texts; those that do exist include the ''Letter to the Governor of Barbados'' ([[George Fox|Fox]], 1671),<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first=George|title=Letter to the Governor of Barbadoes|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/barbados.shtml}}</ref> ''An Apology for the True Christian Divinity'' ([[Robert Barclay|Barclay]], 1678),<ref>{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Robert|title=An Apology for the True Christian Divinity|year=1678|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/apology/}}</ref> ''A Catechism and Confession of Faith'' ([[Robert Barclay|Barclay]], 1690),<ref>{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Robert|title=A Catechism and Confession of Faith|year=1690|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/barclay/catechism/index.html}}</ref> ''The Testimony of the Society of Friends on the Continent of America'' (adopted jointly by all [[Friends United Meeting|orthodox yearly meetings]] in U.S., 1830),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Testimony of the Society of Friends on the Continent of America|year=1830|publisher=Richard and George S Wood|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtctAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> the ''[[Richmond Declaration|Richmond Declaration of Faith]]'' (adopted by [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], 1887),<ref>{{cite web|title=Richmond Declaration of Faith|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/rdf.shtml|publisher=QuakerInfo.com}}</ref> and ''Essential Truths'' ([[Rufus Jones (writer)|Jones]] and Wood, adopted by [[Friends United Meeting|Five Years Meeting]], 1922).<ref>{{cite web|title=Essential Truths|url=http://www.quakerinfo.com/esstruth.shtml|publisher=QuakerInfo.com}}</ref> As a public statement of faith, most yearly meetings publish their own [[Book of Discipline (Quaker)|Book of Discipline]], which expresses Christian discipleship within the experience of Friends in that yearly meeting.\n\n===Conservative===\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 064 - Quakers' Meeting (tone).jpg|thumb|alt=|Conservative Friends worshipping in London in 1809.

Many Wilburites see themselves as the Quakers whose beliefs are truest to original Quaker doctrine, arguing that the majority of Friends \"broke away\" from the Wilburites in the 19th and 20th centuries (rather than vice versa). Conservative Friends place their trust in the immediate guidance of God.<ref name=quakerfinder/> They completely reject all forms of [[religious symbolism]] and outward [[sacraments]], such as the [[Eucharist]] and [[water baptism]]. Conservative Friends do not believe in relying upon the practice of outward rites and sacraments, to have a living relationship with God through Christ; believing that holiness can exist in all of the activities of one's daily life\u2014and that all of life is sacred in God. Many Conservative Friends believe that a meal held with others can become a form of [[Communion (Christianity)|communion]] with God, and with one another.\n\nIn the U.S., Conservative Friends are part of three small Quaker Yearly Meetings in Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa; Ohio Yearly Meeting (Conservative) is generally considered to be the most Bible-centred of the three, retaining Christian Quakers who use plain language, wear plain dress, and live in small villages or rural areas more than the Conservative Friends from the other two Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings.<ref name=Wilburite-Gurneyite/>\n\nIn 2007, total membership of these Yearly Meetings was around 1642,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fwccamericas.org/find_friends/stats_by_country.shtml|title=FWCC Section of the Americas|website=fwccamericas.org|access-date=25 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419003049/http://fwccamericas.org/find_friends/stats_by_country.shtml|archive-date=19 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> making them around 0.4% of the world family of Quakers.\n\n===Evangelical===\n{{See also|Evangelical Friends Church International}}\n\n[[File:Old Camara 038.JPG|thumb|Phoenix Friends Church sign|Sign at entrance of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] Friends Church]]\nEvangelical Friends regard Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour,<ref name=quakerfinder/> and have similar religious beliefs to other [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians. They believe in, and hold a high regard for, the [[penal substitution]] of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ on the Cross at Calvary, [[biblical infallibility]], and the need for every person to personally experience a relationship with God.<ref name=\"Friends Beliefs\">{{cite web|last=Evangelical Friends Church International|title=Friends Beliefs|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/6}}</ref> They believe that the purpose of the Evangelical Friends Church is to evangelise the unsaved people of the world, to spiritually transform them through God's love and through social service to others.<ref name=\"Friends Beliefs\" /> Evangelical Friends regard the Bible as the infallible and self-authenticating Word of God. The statement of faith of [[Evangelical Friends International]] is comparable to the statement of faith of other Evangelical churches. Evangelical Friends who are members of Evangelical Friends International are mainly located in the U.S., Central America, and Asia. Beginning in the 1880s, some Friends began using outward sacraments in their Sunday services, first in Evangelical Friends Church\u2013Eastern Region (then known as Ohio Yearly Meeting [Damascus]). Friends Church\u2013Southwest Region has also approved the practice of using the outward sacraments in their Sunday services. In places where Evangelical Friends are engaged in missionary work, such as in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, adult baptism by immersion in water is carried out. This practice differs from most other Quaker branches of the Religious Society of Friends. {{As of|2014}}, EFCI claims to represent more than 140,000 Friends,<ref name=EFCI>{{cite web|title=Evangelical Friends Church International|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/}}</ref> roughly 39% of the total number of Friends worldwide.\n\n===Gurneyite===\n{{See also|Friends United Meeting}}\n\nGurneyite Friends (aka Friends United Meeting Friends) are the modern-day followers of the Evangelical Quaker theology first proclaimed by [[Joseph John Gurney]], a 19th-century British Friend. They make up 49% of the total number of Quakers worldwide.<ref name=QWRC-intro /> They regard Jesus Christ as their Teacher and Lord,<ref name=quakerfinder/> and favour working closely with other Protestant Christian churches. Gurneyite Friends balance the authority of the Bible as inspired words of God with personal and direct experience of God in their lives. Both children and adults participate in ongoing religious education which emphasises orthodox Christian teaching from the Bible, and in relationship to both orthodox Christian Quaker history and Quaker testimonies. Gurneyite Friends subscribe to a set of orthodox Christian doctrines, such as those found in the [[Richmond Declaration]] of faith. In subsequent years, conflict arose among Gurneyite Friends in relation to the Richmond Declaration of faith. Thus, after a while, the Richmond Declaration of faith was adopted by nearly all of the Gurneyite yearly meetings. The Five Years Meeting of Friends reaffirmed their loyalty to the Richmond Declaration of faith in 1912, but specifically stated that it was not to constitute a Christian creed. Although Gurneyism was the main form of Quakerism in Great Britain in the 19th century, Gurneyite Friends today are in America, Ireland, Africa and India. Many Gurneyite Friends combine \"waiting worship\" (unprogrammed worship) with religious practices commonly found in other Protestant Christian churches, such as the reading of the Bible and the singing of Hymns. A small minority of Gurneyite Friends practice entirely unprogrammed worship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fum.org/quaker-life-local-meeting-directory/ |title=Quaker Life \u2013 Local Meeting Directory |publisher=Friends United Meeting |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112213838/http://fum.org/quaker-life-local-meeting-directory/ |archive-date=12 November 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n===Holiness===\n{{See also|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends}}\n\nHoliness Friends are heavily influenced by the [[Holiness movement]], in particular [[John Wesley]]'s doctrine of [[Christian perfection]], also called \"entire sanctification\". This doctrine states that loving God and humanity totally, as exemplified by Christ, enables believers to rid themselves of voluntary sin. This was a predominant view within Quakerism in the United Kingdom and United States in the 19th century, and it influenced other branches of Quakerism. Holiness Friends argue (leaning on writings that include George Fox's message of ''perfection'') that early Friends had the same understanding of holiness.<ref name=\"central\">{{cite web|last=Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|title=About Us|url=http://www.centralyearlymeetingoffriends.org/AboutUs.dsp|access-date=6 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205212906/http://www.centralyearlymeetingoffriends.org/AboutUs.dsp|archive-date=5 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nToday, while some Friends hold holiness beliefs within most yearly meetings, it is the predominant theological view of [[Central Yearly Meeting of Friends]], (founded in 1926 specifically to promote holiness theology) and the Holiness Mission of the Bolivian Evangelical Friends Church (founded by missionaries from that meeting in 1919, the largest group of Friends in Bolivia).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Margery Post Abbott|display-authors=etal|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0-8108-7088-6|pages=327\u2013328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&pg=PA328&lpg=PA328&dq=Bolivian+Holiness+Mission+Evangelical+Friends+Church&source=bl&ots=_7cCaucsFV&sig=a53kHYYP5vfM8AEozXPzLiGzPrI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MOZsT6HYDqK-0QWIyM3CBg&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Bolivian%20Holiness%20Mission%20Evangelical%20Friends%20Church&f=false|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Liberal===\n{{See also|Friends General Conference|Britain Yearly Meeting|Beanite Quakerism|}}\n\nLiberal Quakerism generally refers to Friends who have taken ideas from liberal Christianity, often sharing a similar mix of ideas, such as more critical Biblical [[hermeneutics]], often with a focus on the [[social gospel]]. The ideas of ''That of God in everyone'' and the ''[[inner light]]'' were popularised by American Friend [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]] in the early 20th century. He and [[John Wilhelm Rowntree]] originated the movement. Liberal Friends were predominant in Great Britain in the 20th century, and among US meetings affiliated to [[Friends General Conference]]; and some meetings in Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa.\n\nThese ideas remain an important part of liberal Friends' understanding of God. Liberal Friends highlight the importance of good works, particularly living a life that upholds the virtues preached by Jesus. They often emphasise pacifism, treating others equally, living simply and telling the truth.<ref name=QWRC-intro/>\n\nLike Conservative Friends, Liberal Friends reject [[religious symbolism]] and sacraments, such as water baptism and the Eucharist. While Liberal Friends recognise the potential of these outward forms for awakening experiences of the Inward [[Light of the World|Light]] of Christ, they are not part of their worship, and are believed unnecessary to authentic Christian spirituality.\n\nThe Bible remains central to most Liberal Friends' worship, and almost all meetings make it available in the [[Friends Meeting House|meeting house]], (often on a table in the centre of the room), which attendees may read privately or publicly during worship. But Liberal Friends decided that the Scriptures should give way to God's leading, if God leads them in a way that is contrary to the Bible. Many Friends are also influenced by liberal Christian theologians, and modern [[Biblical criticism]]. They often adopt non-propositional Biblical hermeneutics, such as believing that the Bible is an anthology of human authors' beliefs and feelings about God, rather than Holy Writ, and that multiple interpretations of the Scriptures are acceptable.\n\nLiberal Friends believe that a corporate confession of faith would be an obstacle\u2014both to authentic listening and to new insight. As a non-creedal form of Christianity, Liberal Quakerism is receptive to a wide range of religious faith understandings. Most Liberal Quaker Yearly Meetings publish a [[Book of Discipline (Quaker)|Faith and Practice]], a book with a range of religious experiences of what it means to be a Friend in that Yearly Meeting.\n\n===Universalist===\n{{main| Quaker Universalist Fellowship}}\nUniversalist Friends affirm [[religious pluralism]], that there are many different paths to God and that understandings of the divine reached through non-Christian religious experiences are as valid as Christian understandings. This group was founded in the late 1970s by John Linton. Linton had worshipped God with the Delhi Worship Group in India (an independent meeting not affiliated to any yearly meeting or wider Quaker group) with Christians, Muslims and Hindus worshipping together.<ref name=\"Universalist History\">{{cite journal|last=Rickermann|first=Sally|title=Quaker Universalist Fellowship: Its History|journal=Journal of the Quaker Universalist Fellowship|year=2007|issue=46|url=http://www.universalistfriends.org/uf046.html#Rickerman}}</ref>\nFollowing a move to Great Britain, he founded the [[Quaker Universalist Fellowship]] in 1978. Later his views spread to the US, where the Quaker Universalist Fellowship was founded in 1983.<ref name=\"Universalist History\" /> Most of the Friends who joined these two fellowships were Liberal Friends from Britain Yearly Meeting in the United Kingdom, and Liberal Friends from Friends General Conference in the United States. Interest in Quaker Universalism is low among Friends from other Yearly meetings. The views of the Universalists provoked controversy{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} between themselves and Christian Quakers within Britain Yearly Meeting, and within Friends General Conference, during the 1980s. Despite the label, Quaker \"Universalists\" are not necessarily [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]], embracing the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]].\n\n===Non-theist===\n{{main|Nontheist Quakers}}\n\nThese Friends have views similar to other post-Christian non-theists in other churches such as the [[Sea of Faith]] that emerged from the [[Anglican]] church. They are predominantly atheists, agnostics, and humanists who nevertheless value membership in a religious organization. The first organisation for non-theist Friends was the ''Humanistic Society of Friends'', founded in Los Angeles in 1939.

They may bear witness in many ways, according to how they believe God is leading them. Although Quakers share how they relate to God and the world, mirroring Christian ethical codes, for example the [[Sermon on the Mount]] or the [[Sermon on the Plain]], Friends argue that they feel personally moved by God rather than following an ethical code.\n\nSome theologians classify Friends' religious witness into categories\u2014known by some Friends as ''testimonies.'' These Friends believe these principles and practices testify to, witness to, or provide evidence for God's truth. No categorisation is universally accepted.<ref name=testimonies/>\n\nIn East Africa, Friends teach peace and non-violence, simplicity, honesty, equality, humility, marriage and sexual ethics (defining marriage as lifelong between one man and one woman), sanctity of life (opposition to abortion), cultural conflicts and Christian life.<ref>Friends United Meeting in East Africa (2002) \"[http://www.quakerinfo.com/eastafricafandp.pdf Christian Faith and Practice in the Friends Church]\".</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the acronym SPICES is often used by many Yearly Meetings (Simplicity, Peace, Integrity, Community, Equality and Stewardship). Stewardship is not recognised as a Testimony by all Yearly Meetings. Rocky Mountain Yearly Meeting Friends put their faith in action through living their lives by the following principles: prayer, personal integrity, stewardship (which includes giving away minimum of 10% income and refraining from lotteries), marriage and family (lifelong commitment), regard for mind and body (refraining from certain amusements, propriety and modesty of dress, abstinence from alcohol, tobacco and drugs), peace and non-violence (including refusing to participate in war), abortion (opposition to abortion, practical ministry to women with unwanted pregnancy and promotion of adoption), human sexuality, the Christian and state (look to God for authority, not the government), capital punishment (find alternatives), human equality, women in ministry (recognising women and men have an equal part to play in ministry).<ref>Rocky Mountain Yearly Meeting of the Friends Church (1997) \"[http://www.rmym.org/Faith_And_Practice_Print.php The Faith and Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627173003/http://www.rmym.org/Faith_And_Practice_Print.php |date=27 June 2012 }}\"</ref>\nThe Southern Appalachian Yearly Meeting and Association lists as testimonies: Integrity, Peace, Simplicity, Equality and Community; Areas of witness lists Children, Education, Government, Sexuality and Harmony with Nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sayma.org/online_documents/faith_and_practice/F&P2012final.pdf |title=Testifying to the Life of the SPIRIT |author=Southern Appalachian Yearly Meeting and Association |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the acronym STEP or PEST is used (peace, equality, simplicity and truth).

This does not use names of calendar units derived from the names of pagan deities. The days begin with First Day (Sunday) and ends on Seventh Day (Saturday), and months run from First Month (January) to Twelfth Month (December). This is based on the terms used in the Bible: e.g., Jesus Christ's followers went to the tomb early on the First Day of the week.<ref>{{bibleverse|Mark|16:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Luke|24:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|John|20:1|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|John|20:19|NIV}}</ref> The plain calendar emerged in the 17th century in England in the [[Puritan]] movement, but became closely identified with Friends by the end of the 1650s, and was commonly employed into the 20th century. It is less commonly encountered today. The term ''First Day School'' is commonly used, for what is called by most churches ''Sunday School.''\n\nIn common with other Christian denominations derived from the 16th century [[Puritanism]], many Friends do not observe religious festivals (e.g. [[Christmas]], [[Lent]], or [[Easter]]), but instead believe that Christ's birth, [[crucifixion]], and [[resurrection]], should be commemorated every day of the year. For example, many Quakers feel that [[fasting]] at [[Lent]], but then eating in excess at other times of the year is [[hypocrisy]] and therefore many Quakers, rather than observing Lent, live a simple lifestyle all the year round (''see [[testimony of simplicity]]''). These practices are often referred to as the ''testimony against times and seasons.''\n\nSome Friends are non-Sabbatarians, holding that \"every day is the Lord's day\", and that what should be done on a First Day should be done every day of the week, although Meeting for Worship is usually held on a First Day, following the advice first issued by elders in 1656.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dewsbury|first1=William|last2=Farnworth|first2=Richard|title=The Epistle from the Elders at Balby, 1656|url=http://www.qhpress.org/texts/balby.html}}</ref>\n\n==Worship==\n{{See also|Meeting for worship}}\nMost groups of Quakers meet for regular worship. There are two main types of worship worldwide: programmed worship and waiting worship.\n\n===Programmed worship===\n{{See also|Friends United Meeting|Evangelical Friends Church International|Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|}}\n[[File:West Mansfield Friends Church.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|West Mansfield Friends Church, Ohio, affiliated with the [[Evangelical Friends Church International]]]]\nIn ''programmed worship'' there is often a prepared Biblical message, which may be delivered by an individual with theological training from a Bible College. There may be hymns, a sermon, Bible readings, joint prayers and a period of silent worship. The worship resembles the [[church service]]s of other [[Protestant]] denominations, although in most cases does not include the Eucharist. A paid pastor may be responsible for [[pastoral care]]. Worship of this kind is celebrated by about 89% of Friends worldwide.<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5\u20136}} It is found in many Yearly Meetings in Africa, Asia and parts of the US (central and southern), and is common in programmed meetings affiliated to [[Friends United Meeting]], (who make up around 49% of worldwide membership<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5}}), and evangelical meetings, including those affiliated to [[Evangelical Friends International]], (who make up at least 40% of Friends worldwide<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page=5\u20136}}). The religious event is sometimes called a Quaker [[meeting for worship]] or sometimes called a Friends church service. This religious tradition arose among Friends in the United States, in the 19th century, and in response to the many converts to Christian Quakerism during the national [[Great awakening|spiritual revival]] of the time. Friends meetings in Africa and Latin America were generally started by Orthodox Friends from programmed elements of the Society, therefore most African and Latin American Friends worship in a programmed style.\n\nSome Friends also hold \"Semi-Programmed\" Worship, which brings programmed elements such as hymns and readings into an otherwise unprogrammed worship service.\n\n===Unprogrammed worship===\n{{See also|Conservative Friends|Friends General Conference|Britain Yearly Meeting|Beanite Quakerism|}}\n{{external media | float = right | headerimage= [[File:Race Street Friends Meeting House, Race Street west of Fifteenth Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA HABS PA-6687-13.jpg|frameless]]\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxjH4sa2RFI What to Expect in Quaker Meeting for Worship], QuakerSpeak<ref name=\"qs\">{{cite web | title =What to Expect in Quaker Meeting for Worship | publisher =QuakerSpeak | date = 20 November 2014 | url =http://quakerspeak.com/what-to-expect-quaker-meeting-worship/ | accessdate =25 April 2016 }}</ref> }}\n\n''Unprogrammed worship'' (also known as ''waiting worship'', \"silent worship\", or ''holy communion in the manner of Friends)'' is based on the practices of George Fox and the Early Friends, who based their religious beliefs and practices on their interpretation of how the early Christians worshipped God their Heavenly Father. Friends gather together in \"expectant waiting upon God\" to experience his still small voice leading them from within. There is no plan on how the meeting will proceed, and actual practice varies widely between Meetings and individual worship services. Friends believe that God plans what will happen, with his spirit leading people to speak. When a participant feels led to speak, he or she will stand and share a spoken message of (\"[[Christian ministry|vocal ministry]]\") in front of others. When this happens, Quakers believe that the spirit of God is speaking through the speaker. After someone has spoken, it is customary to allow a few minutes pass in silence for reflection on what has been said, before further vocal ministry is given. Sometimes a meeting is entirely silent, sometimes many speak. These meetings lasted for several hours in George Fox's day. Modern meetings are often limited to an hour, ending when two people (usually the [[Elder (Christianity)#Quakers (Religious Society of Friends)|elders]]) exchange the [[sign of peace]] by [[handshake]]. This handshake is often shared by the others. This style of worship is the norm in Great Britain, Ireland, the continent of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa, Canada, and parts of the United States (particularly yearly meetings associated with [[Friends General Conference]] and [[Beanite Quakerism]])\u2014constituting about 11%<ref name=QWRC-intro />{{rp|page 5}} of Quakers. Those who worship in this style hold each person to be equal before God and capable of knowing [[Light of the World|the light]] of God directly. Anyone present may speak if they feel led to do so. Traditionally, [[Recorded Minister]]s were recognised for their particular gift in vocal ministry. This religious practice continues among ''Conservative'' Friends and ''Liberal Friends'' (e.g. [[New York Yearly Meeting]]<ref>{{cite web|last=New York Yearly Meeting|title=Formal Guidelines from New York Yearly Meeting's Faith and Practice|url=http://www.nyym.org/index.php?q=node/252}}</ref>). Many meetings where Liberal Friends predominate abolished this religious practice. [[London Yearly Meeting]] of Friends abolished the acknowledging and recording of [[Recorded Minister]]s in 1924.\n\n==Governance and organisation==\n\n===Organizational government and polity===\n<!-- [[Meeting for Business]] redirects to this section -->\n[[File:Meeting in York.JPG|alt=|thumb|Quaker Business Meeting in [[York]]]]\n[[Ecclesiastical polity|Governance]] and decision making is conducted at a special meeting for worship\u2014often called a ''meeting for worship with a concern for business'' or ''meeting for worship for church affairs'' at which all members can attend, as in a [[Congregationalist polity|Congregational]] church. Quakers consider this to be a form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who ''wait upon the Lord'' to discover God's will, believing that they are not making their own decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.<ref name=QuakersinScotland/>\n\nAs in a ''meeting for worship'', each member is expected to listen to God, and, if led by Him, stand up and contribute. In some business meetings, Friends wait for the [[Clerk (Quaker)|clerk]] to acknowledge them before speaking. Direct replies to someone's contribution are not permitted, with an aim of seeking truth rather than of debating. A decision is reached when the meeting, as a whole, feels that the \"way forward\" has been discerned (also called \"coming to unity\"). There is no voting. On some occasions Friends may delay a decision because they feel the meeting is not following God's will. Others (especially non-Friends) may describe this as [[consensus decision-making]]; however in general Friends continue to seek God's will. It is assumed that, if everyone is attuned to God's spirit, the way forward will become clear.\n\n===International organization===\n{{Main|Friends World Committee for Consultation}}\n[[Friends World Committee for Consultation]] (FWCC) is the international Quaker organization that loosely unifies the different religious traditions of Quakers; FWCC brings together the largest variety of Friends in the world. Friends World Committee for Consultation is divided into four sections to represent different regions of the world: Africa, Asia West Pacific, Europe and Middle East, and the Americas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nVarious organizations associated with Friends include a U.S. lobbying organization based in [[Washington, D.C.]] called the [[Friends Committee on National Legislation]] (FCNL); service organizations such as the [[American Friends Service Committee]] (AFSC), the [[Quaker United Nations Office]]s, [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness]], Friends Committee on Scouting, the Quaker Peace Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, and the [[Alternatives to Violence Project]].\n\n===Yearly meetings===\n{{Main|Yearly Meeting}}\nQuakers today are organised into independent and regional, national bodies called [[Yearly Meetings]], which have often split from one another because of Christian [[doctrinal]] differences. Several associations unite Quakers who share similar religious beliefs\u2014for example [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] unites [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christian Friends]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Friends Beliefs|url=http://www.evangelicalfriends.org/6|publisher=Evangelical Friends Church International}}</ref> [[Friends United Meeting]] unites Friends into \"fellowships where Jesus Christ is known, loved, and obeyed as Teacher and Lord;\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Friends United Meeting \u2013 About Us |url=http://fum.org:80/about-us/ |publisher=Friends United Meeting |accessdate=5 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228204503/http://fum.org/about-us/ |archivedate=28 February 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and [[Friends General Conference]] links together Quakers that have non-creedal, liberal religious beliefs. Many Quaker [[Yearly Meeting]]s, are also members of [[Friends World Committee for Consultation]], an international fellowship of Yearly Meetings from different Quaker religious traditions.\n\n===Membership===\nA Friend is a member of a Yearly Meeting, usually beginning with membership in a local monthly meeting. Methods for acquiring membership vary; for example, in most Kenyan yearly meetings, attenders who wish to become members are required to take part in around two years of adult education, memorising key Bible passages, and learning about the history of orthodox Christianity, and of Christian Quakerism. Within Britain Yearly Meeting, membership is acquired through a process of [[peer review]], where a potential member is visited by several members who present a report to the other members of the monthly meeting before a decision is reached.\n\nWithin some Friends Churches in the Evangelical Friends Church, in particular in Rwanda, Burundi, and parts of the U.S., an adult believer's baptism by immersion in water, is optional. Within Liberal Friends, Conservative Friends, and Pastoral Friends Churches, Friends do not practise [[baptism|water baptism]], [[infant baptism|Christening]], or other initiation ceremonies to admit a new member or a newborn baby. Children are often welcomed into the meeting at their first attendance. Formerly, children born to Quaker parents automatically became members (sometimes called ''Birthright membership''), but this is no longer the case in many areas. Some parents apply for membership on behalf of their children, while others allow the child to decide whether to become a member when they are ready, and older in age. Some meetings adopt a policy that children, some time after becoming young adults, must apply independently for membership.\n\n==Meetings for worship for specific tasks==\n\n===Memorial services===\n[[File:George Fox marker Bunhill Fields.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Quaker testimony of simplicity extends to memorialisation as well. Founder George Fox is remembered with a simple grave marker at [[Quaker Gardens, Islington]].]]\nTraditional Quaker memorial services are held as a form of worship and are known as memorial meetings. Friends gather for worship and offer remembrances about the deceased. In some Quaker religious traditions, the coffin or ashes are not present. Memorial meetings may be held many weeks after the death, which can enable wider attendance, and can also replace grief with spiritual reflection, and celebration of life to dominate. Memorial meetings can last over an hour, particularly if many people attend. Memorial services give everyone a chance to remember the lost individual in their own way, comforting those present, and re-affirming the love of the people in the wider community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Marriage===\n{{Main|Quaker wedding}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\nA ''meeting for worship for the solemnisation of marriage'' in an unprogrammed Friends meeting is similar to any other unprogrammed Meeting for Worship.<ref name=QinGB/> The pair exchange vows before God and gathered witnesses, and the meeting returns to open worship. At the rise of meeting, the witnesses, including the youngest children, are asked to sign the wedding certificate as a record. In Great Britain, Quakers keep a separate record of the union and notify the [[General Register Office]].\n\nIn the early days of the United States, there was doubt whether a marriage solemnised in that manner was entitled to legal recognition. Over the years, each state has set rules for the procedure. Most US states expect the marriage document to be signed by a single officiant (a priest, rabbi, minister, Justice of the Peace, etc.). Quakers routinely modify the document to allow three or four Friends to sign as the officiant. Often, these are the members of a committee of ministry and oversight, who have helped the couple plan their marriage. Usually, a separate document containing their vows and the signatures of all present is kept by the couple, and often displayed prominently in their home.\n\nIn many Friends meetings, the couple meet with a [[clearness committee]] prior to the wedding. This committee's purpose is to discuss with the couple the many aspects of marriage and life as a couple. If the couple seems ready, the marriage is recommended to the meeting.\n\nAs in the wider society, there is a wide diversity of views on the issue of [[same-sex marriage]], and Friends have varying views on the topic. Various Friends meetings around the world have voiced support for, and have recognised, same-sex marriages. In 1986, Hartford Friends Meeting in Connecticut, U.S., reached the decision that \"the Meeting recognised a committed union in a celebration of marriage, under the care of the Meeting. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both homosexual and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice.\"<ref name=\"religioustolerance.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_quak.htm|title=The Society of Friends (Quakers) and Homosexuality|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> Since then, some other meetings of liberal and progressive Friends from Australia, Britain, New Zealand, parts of North America, and other countries have recognised marriage between partners of the same sex. In jurisdictions where same-sex marriage is not recognised by the civil authorities, some meetings follow the practice of early Quakers in overseeing the union without reference to the state. There are also Friends who do not support same-sex marriage, and some Evangelical and Pastoral yearly meetings in the United States have issued public statements stating that homosexuality is a sin.<ref name=\"religioustolerance.org\"/>\n\n==National and international divisions and organisation==\nLike many religious movements, the Religious Society of Friends has evolved, changed, and split into subgroups.\n\nQuakerism started in England and Wales, and quickly spread to Ireland, the Netherlands,<ref name=Netherlands /> Barbados<ref name=Barbados /> and North America.

In 1910 this community built the Ramallah Friends Meetinghouse and later added another building that was used for community outreach.\n\nThe Ramallah Friends Meeting has always played a vital role in the community. In 1948 the buildings and grounds became the home to many Palestinian refugees. Throughout the years, the members of the Ramallah Friends Meeting organised numerous community programmes such as the Children's Play Centre, the First Day School, and women's activities.\n\nBy the early 1990s the Meetinghouse and Annex, which housed meeting rooms and bathroom facilities, fell into disrepair as a result of damage inflicted by time and impact of conflict. So serious was the deterioration of the meetinghouse that by the middle 1990s it was impossible to use the building at all.\n\nA further blow to the Friends and the wider Palestinian community was the high level of emigration brought on by the economic situation and the hardships arising from the continuing Israeli military occupation. The Meetinghouse, which had served as a place of worship for the Friends in Ramallah could no longer be used as such and the Annex could no longer be used for community outreach.\n\nIn 2002 a committee consisting of members of the Religious Society of Friends in the US and the Clerk of the Ramallah Meeting began to raise funds for the renovations of the buildings and grounds of the Meetinghouse. By November 2004 the renovations were complete, and on 6 March 2005, exactly 95 years to the day after the dedication, the Meetinghouse and Annex were rededicated as a Quaker and community resource.\n\nFriends meet every Sunday morning at 10:30&nbsp;a.m. for unprogrammed Meeting for Worship.

The reference to \"monthly\" is because the meeting meets monthly to conduct the group's business. Most \"monthly meetings\" meet for worship at least once a week; some meetings have several worship meetings during the week. In programmed traditions, local congregations are often referred to as \"Friends Churches\" or \"Meetings\".\n\nMonthly meetings are often part of a regional group called a ''quarterly meeting'', which is usually part of an even larger group called a ''yearly meeting;'' with the adjectives \"quarterly\" and \"yearly\" referring specifically to the frequency of ''meetings for worship with a concern for business''.\n\nSome yearly meetings, like Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, belong to larger organisations to help maintain order and communication within the Society. The three chief ones are [[Friends General Conference]] (FGC), [[Friends United Meeting]] (FUM), and [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] (EFCI). In all three groups, most member organisations, though not necessarily members are from the United States. FGC is theologically the most liberal of the three groups, while EFCI is the most evangelical. FUM is the largest. [[Friends United Meeting]] was originally known as \"Five Years Meeting\". Some monthly meetings belong to more than one larger organisation, while others are fully independent.\n{{Clear right}}\n\n==Relations with other churches and faiths==\n===Ecumenical relations===\nMany Quakers prior to the 20th century considered the Religious Society of Friends to be a Christian movement, but did not feel that their religious faith fit within the categories of [[Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]], or [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<ref name=BBCreligion&ethics/> Many Conservative Friends, while fully seeing themselves as orthodox Christians, choose to remain separate from other Christian groups.\n\nMany Friends in Liberal Friends' meetings are actively involved in the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]], often working closely with other [[Mainline Protestant]] and liberal Christian churches, with whom they share common religious ground. A concern for peace and social justice often brings Friends together with other Christian churches and other Christian groups. Some Liberal Quaker yearly meetings are members of ecumenical pan-Christian organisations, which include Protestant, Orthodox, and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches\u2014for example [[Philadelphia Yearly Meeting]] is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]].<ref name=\"ncccusa1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html |title=Members of the National Council of Churches |publisher=Ncccusa.org |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125143317/http://www.ncccusa.org/members/index.html |archivedate=25 November 2011  }}</ref> [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] is a member of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and [[Friends General Conference]] is a member of the [[World Council of Churches]].<ref name=\"oikoumene1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-families/friends-quakers.html |title=Friends (Quakers) |publisher=Oikoumene.org |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104180955/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/church-families/friends-quakers.html |archivedate=4 November 2011  }}</ref>\n\nGuerneyite Friends would typically see themselves as part of an orthodox Christian movement and work closely with other Christian groups.

The North American branch of [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] is a member church of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]]. Evangelical Friends tend to be less involved with non-evangelical churches and are not members of the [[World Council of Churches]] or [[National Council of Churches]].\n\nThe majority of other Christian groups recognise Friends among their fellow-Christians.<ref name=BBCreligion&ethics/> Some people who attend Quaker Meetings assume that Quakers are not Christians, when they do not hear overtly Christian language during the meeting for worship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/mar/18/quaker-religion-jesus-christianity |title=If Quakers were more Christian |work=The Guardian |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Relations with other faiths===\nRelationships between Quakers and non-Christians vary considerably, according to sect, geography, and history.\n\nEarly Quakers distanced themselves from practices that they saw as [[Paganism|pagan]], such as refusing to use the usual names of the days of the week, since they were derived from the names of pagan deities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yount|first=David|title=How the Quakers invented America|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|isbn=0-7425-5833-9|page=11}}</ref> They refused to celebrate [[Christmas]] because they believed it was based on pagan festivities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frost|first=Jerry William|title=The Quaker family in colonial America: a social history of the Society of Friends, Volume 2|year=1968|publisher=University of Wisconsin|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=436}}</ref>\n\nEarly Friends attempted to convert adherents of other world religions to Christianity.
