The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004 while living in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but is based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as of 2011. It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''. The review was posted in seven parts on [[YouTube]], and was presented by his character \"Harry S. Plinkett\". While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] before that, his ''The Phantom Menace'' and subsequent [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel]] reviews were praised for both content and presentation.\n\nNumerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (''Half in the Bag'', ''Best of the Worst'', and ''re:View''), short comedies (''The Nerd Crew'') and [[web series]] (''The Grabowskis''). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''The Recovered'', ''Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant'' and ''[[Space Cop]]''. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans and friends Jack Packard, Josh Davis and Jessi Nakles appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases.\n\n==Mr. Plinkett {{anchor|Mr. Plinkett}}==\nStoklasa created his first video review for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' after watching the film again in 2008. Stoklasa believed his own voice sounded \"too boring\" for the review and adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, a character he had previously used in several short films (originally played by Rich Evans).<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/122310-red-letter-medias-fresh-spin-on-the-crazed-youtube-reviewer/ | title = RedLetterMedia's Spin on the Crazed YouTube Reviewer | magazine = [[PopMatters]] | date = March 16, 2010 | accessdate = March 16, 2010 | first = L.B. | last = Jefferies }}</ref> The character first appeared in ''You're Invited!

He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and ''Phantom Menace'' without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters [[Han Solo]] and [[C-3PO]], Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the ''Phantom Menace'' characters [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"dailybeast\"/><ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> He notes Lucas' attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive ''Star Wars'' films, which he refers to as \"The Ending Multiplication Effect\".<ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation.\n\n===Reception===\nStoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize [[mashup (video)|mashup]] with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources.\n\nLiterary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'' by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as ''Star Wars'' marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by [[Guy Debord]] as \"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\", ''d\u00e9tournement'' is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 109|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 108|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nKirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of [[catharsis]]. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\".<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\">{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 112|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\" Kirbach writes.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 111|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> And further:\n\n{{quote|Stoklasa's major conceit\u2014that someone would have to be \"crazy\" to watch movies the way Plinkett does\u2014also implies a barely hidden inverse: that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who ''don't'' watch movies this way. Plinkett's obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership, but they are also Stoklasa's apology for\u2014or defense against\u2014a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological. This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane: the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry, or the massive culture industry itself. Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates: psychotic, sexist, homicidal.<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \"amazing film scholarship\" on the ''Star Wars'' prequels that demonstrate how much of the ''Star Wars'' universe is squandered by them.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/patton-oswalt-silver-screen-fiend-interview | title = Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop | first = Jennifer | last = Wood | date = January 27, 2015 | accessdate = January 27, 2015 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the reviews \"legendary\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/ |title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas |work= The Daily Telegraph |first=Chris|last=Bell|date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate= December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the reviews have also been criticized by ''Star Wars'' fans.

Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action-comedy film ''[[Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant]]'', made in 2005 and available on [[Netflix]]<ref name=\"heeb\" /> (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); ''The Recovered'', a horror thriller starring [[Tina Krause]]; and ''Feeding Frenzy'', a 2010 [[genre]]-[[parody|spoof]] of puppet monster movies like ''[[Gremlins]]''. ''Feeding Frenzy'' featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the ''Phantom Menace'' review.<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \"You're Invited\".\n\nStoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom ''The Grabowskis'', opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film ''[[Space Cop]]'', which had been in production for at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/shorts/space-cop-trailer/|title=Space Cop Trailer #1 - Red Letter Media|website=redlettermedia.com}}</ref> ''Space Cop'' stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's [[Bandcamp]] page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours.\n\n==''Half in the Bag''==\n''Half in the Bag'' is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and [[Fourth wall|fourth wall breaking]] overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'' and a 1980s [[sitcom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with himself and Bauman playing [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR.\n\nThe show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Fans often call this iteration of the character \"Fake Plinkett\", but Stoklasa has noted that Evans was the first person to portray Plinkett, with Stoklasa's later portrayal based on Evans's performance. [[Tim Heidecker]], who hosts a satirical movie review show ''[[On Cinema]]'', makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C7UCMmF5g |title=Half in the Bag: Episode 37 - Special guest star Tim Heidecker |last=RedLetterMedia |date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nStoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.\n\n[[Graham Linehan]] praised Red Letter Media in an interview with [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian and writer [[Richard Herring]] on ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''.

Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \"Best of the Worst\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in [[acetone]], forcing a DVD through a [[paper shredder]], dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers.\n\nCanadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters [[Max Landis]] and [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], comic book artist [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]], actors [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski.\n\nSome episodes feature the \"Wheel of the Worst\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched.<ref name=\"MakeUseOf\"/> Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \"Dog Sitter\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use [[AOL]]). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' praised ''Best of the Worst'' for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140117/entlife/701179987/|title= Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |author=Sean Stangland |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \"Choose-And-Lose\" and the [[Plinko|Plinketto Board]]. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \"Black Spine Edition\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette.\n\nSometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed [[B movie]]s. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \"Spotlight Series\". The first of these reviews featured the film ''Hollywood Cop'' by director [[Amir Shervan]] was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies ''Suburban Sasquatch'', ''Lycan Colony'' and ''The Last Vampire on Earth'' have also been featured.\n\nIn 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and low-budget films ''Surviving Edged Weapons'' and ''[[Creating Rem Lezar]]''.\n\n==''re:View''==\nOn May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called ''re:View''. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either [[cult film|cult classics]] such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' and ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'', or well renowned genre-defining films like ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film. ''re:View'' has also featured ''[[Star Trek]]'' films and episodes, a particular favorite of Stoklasa's.\n\nFor an episode featuring ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', the screenwriter of the film, [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with ''[[Samurai Cop]]'' lead [[Matt Hannon]], though this occurred prior to the creation of the ''re:View'' branding and format. Former child star [[Macaulay Culkin]] made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', and has continued to recur in both this series as well as Best of the Worst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7_oyCZqj0|title=Hackers - reView|first=|last=RedLetterMedia|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/macaulay-culkin-ueberraschender-auftritt-bei-youtube-kritikern-1144705/|title=Macaulay Culkin: \u00dcberraschender Auftritt bei YouTube-Kritikern|date=24 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast''==\nThe first episode being uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 5 January 2017, ''The Nerd Crew'' parodies [[pop culture]] \"[[fanboyism]]\" and video series such as [[Screen Junkies]], [[Collider (website)|Collider]], and [[John Campea|''The John Campea Show'']], with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \"[[wikt:man child|manchild]]ren\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/the-frenzied-fraud-of-forced-fandom/|title=The Frenzied Fraud of Forced Fandom|date=1 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> [[Product placement]], [[native advertising]] and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/diese-drei-filmnerds-zerstoeren-rogue-one-und-disney-mit-nur-einem-youtube-video-736791/|title=Diese drei Filmnerds zerst\u00f6ren \"Rogue One\" und Disney mit nur einem YouTube-Video|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokadr.ru/blog/2017/12/16/5411.shtml|title=5 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438: \"\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\", \"\u0425\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044b\", \"\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0438 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438|website=kinokadr.ru}}</ref>\n\n== Commentary tracks ==\nSince 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\">{{Cite web|url=https://redlettermedia.bandcamp.com/audio|title=Red Letter Media commentary tracks|last=|first=|date=|website=Red Letter Media|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves.\n\n;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release)<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\"/>\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''\n*''[[Samurai Cop]]''\n*''[[Ghostbusters II]]''\n*''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\n*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n*''[[The Terminator]]''\n*''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''\n*''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n*''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''\n*''[[Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]''\n*''[[Gremlins]]''\n*''[[Rogue One]]''\n*''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]''\n*''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Jingle All the Way]]''\n*''[[Army of Darkness]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==''Previously Recorded''==\nIn July 2014, Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name ''Previously Recorded'' or ''Pre-Rec''.

The company was formed by Stoklasa in 2004 while living in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], but is based in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as of 2011. It attracted significant attention in 2009 through Stoklasa's 70-minute video review of the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''. The review was posted in seven parts on [[YouTube]], and was presented by his character \"Harry S. Plinkett\". While Stoklasa had published other video reviews of several [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] before that, his ''The Phantom Menace'' and subsequent [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel]] reviews were praised for both content and presentation.\n\nNumerous other series have been produced by RedLetterMedia, including several review-based web series (''Half in the Bag'', ''Best of the Worst'', and ''re:View''), short comedies (''The Nerd Crew'') and [[web series]] (''The Grabowskis''). Low budget features produced by and starring Stoklasa and Red Letter Media affiliates have been largely horror and comedy, such as ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''The Recovered'', ''Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant'' and ''[[Space Cop]]''. Alongside Stoklasa and Bauman, Red Letter Media also employs Rich Evans as a full-time actor and stagehand for their projects. Stoklasa, Bauman, Evans and friends Jack Packard, Josh Davis and Jessi Nakles appear as cast members for the vast majority of their releases.\n\n==Mr. Plinkett {{anchor|Mr. Plinkett}}==\nStoklasa created his first video review for ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' after watching the film again in 2008. Stoklasa believed his own voice sounded \"too boring\" for the review and adopted the persona of Harry S. Plinkett, a character he had previously used in several short films (originally played by Rich Evans).<ref name=\"popmatters\">{{cite magazine | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/122310-red-letter-medias-fresh-spin-on-the-crazed-youtube-reviewer/ | title = RedLetterMedia's Spin on the Crazed YouTube Reviewer | magazine = [[PopMatters]] | date = March 16, 2010 | accessdate = March 16, 2010 | first = L.B. | last = Jefferies }}</ref> The character first appeared in ''You're Invited!

After that, he would write a 20-30 page script for it in the Plinkett character, voice it, and edit it together along with some improvisations.<ref name=\"gp-interview\">{{cite web |url=http://geekpropaganda.net/?p=1100 |title=Red Letter Media's Mike Stoklasa |publisher=geekpropaganda.net |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210112234/http://geekpropaganda.net/?p=1100 |archivedate=February 10, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n'''''The Phantom Menace'''''\n\nStoklasa's review of ''The Phantom Menace'' was published to YouTube on December 10, 2009, and quickly became popular, receiving over 5 million views since its release.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> The video was widely linked to by many people across the internet, including celebrities such as [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[Simon Pegg]].<ref name=\"popmatters\"/><ref name=\"cinemablend\">{{cite web | url =http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Epic-70-Minute-Review-Of-Star-Wars-The-Phantom-Menace-16207.html | title = Epic 70-Minute Review Of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace | publisher = Cinema Blend | date = December 17, 2009 | accessdate =March 17, 2010 | first = Eric | last = Eisenberg }}</ref> In comparison to his earlier ''Star Trek'' movie reviews, which lasted 30 to 40 minutes, the ''Phantom Menace'' review had a total run time of approximately 70 minutes.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> The review took between seven and ten days to complete.<ref name=\"heeb\">{{cite web | url = http://www.heebmagazine.com/man-behind-epic-_phantom-menace_-review-speaks/ | title = Man Behind Epic Phantom Menace Review Speaks | work = [[Heeb (magazine)|Heeb]] | author=Abrams, Brian | date = January 4, 2010 | accessdate = March 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{By whom|date=July 2017}} Stoklasa believes that the film has no real protagonist or strong characters in general. He demonstrates this by asking his friends to describe characters from the original trilogy and ''Phantom Menace'' without referring to the characters' physical appearances or occupations. Juxtaposed with the colorful personality descriptions they give for the characters [[Han Solo]] and [[C-3PO]], Stoklasa's friends are unable to come up with similarly definite descriptions for the ''Phantom Menace'' characters [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]].<ref name=\"dailybeast\"/><ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa believes that many of the decisions made by Jinn's character are highly questionable.<ref name=\"cinemablend\"/> He further suggests that the character is entirely unnecessary to the plot and overall story save to have a final climactic lightsaber battle.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> He notes Lucas' attempt to add more concurrent plot elements in each of the successive ''Star Wars'' films, which he refers to as \"The Ending Multiplication Effect\".<ref name=\"ifc\"/> Stoklasa then illustrates the chaotic and confusing nature of ending the film by pulling together four concurrent plot threads, each with a radically different tone, unclear objectives, and an overall lack of proper character motivation.\n\n===Reception===\nStoklasa's reviews have been considered part of an emerging art form that hybridize [[mashup (video)|mashup]] with video essays, as they use a combination of footage from the movie in question and other related sources.\n\nLiterary and cultural critic Benjamin Kirbach argues that Plinkett enacts a kind of ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'' by recontextualizing images that would otherwise serve as ''Star Wars'' marketing material (such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews). Defined by [[Guy Debord]] as \"the reuse of preexisting artistic elements in a new ensemble\", ''d\u00e9tournement'' is a way of generating meaning out of cultural texts that is antithetical to their original intent.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 109|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Kirbach argues that Stoklasa uses this tactic to construct a subversive narrative that frames George Lucas as \"a lazy, out-of-touch, and thoroughly unchallenged filmmaker\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 108|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nKirbach also argues that Plinkett's popularity can be explained, in part, as a form of [[catharsis]]. Because he is portrayed as insane, the Plinkett shtick \"legitimates our nerd-rage by literalizing it\".<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\">{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 112|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> Plinkett enrolls George Lucas in an ongoing [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] drama as the castrating father figure, a father figure we are invited to rage against owing to his flagrant ineptitude. But aside from raw catharsis, Kirbach claims that Plinkett's insanity is also a critique of the film industry itself. By fictionalizing his critic, Stoklasa constructs a character who is unable to speak at a safe distance from the text he analyzes. \"Plinkett becomes the figure of a consumer culture that has been force-fed Hollywood schlock beyond its carrying capacity,\" Kirbach writes.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kirbach|first= Benjamin|date= 2014|title= Critical Psychosis: Genre, ''D\u00e9tournement'', and Critique in Mr. Plinkett's ''Star Wars'' Reviews|url= http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=ijcs |journal= Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies|volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 111|access-date= 4 May 2015}}</ref> And further:\n\n{{quote|Stoklasa's major conceit\u2014that someone would have to be \"crazy\" to watch movies the way Plinkett does\u2014also implies a barely hidden inverse: that the film industry has induced a consumerist fantasy in people who ''don't'' watch movies this way. Plinkett's obscenity and jokiness are without a doubt designed to garner viewership, but they are also Stoklasa's apology for\u2014or defense against\u2014a culture that already construes his level of passion as pathological. This central irony leads us to question what is actually more insane: the consumer who rejects the expressions of a massive culture industry, or the massive culture industry itself. Plinkett satirizes the kind of consumer such a system generates: psychotic, sexist, homicidal.<ref name=\"Kirbach 2014 112\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', comedian [[Patton Oswalt]] noted that the Mr. Plinkett reviews are an example of \"amazing film scholarship\" on the ''Star Wars'' prequels that demonstrate how much of the ''Star Wars'' universe is squandered by them.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/patton-oswalt-silver-screen-fiend-interview | title = Patton Oswalt on Movie Addiction, Star Wars, and the One Film He'd Watch on Loop | first = Jennifer | last = Wood | date = January 27, 2015 | accessdate = January 27, 2015 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called the reviews \"legendary\" and described them as being more popular than the actual films.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-the-force-awakens/george-lucas-movies-hate-defence/ |title=Why it's time to stop hating George Lucas |work= The Daily Telegraph |first=Chris|last=Bell|date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate= December 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the reviews have also been criticized by ''Star Wars'' fans. Stoklasa stated that he feels \"''Star Wars'' to some people is like a religion so they respond to attacks on it as such.\"<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> One fan wrote a 108-page-long point-by-point response to the ''Phantom Menace'' review, taking issue with many of Stoklasa's criticisms,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-fan-writes-108page-rebuttal-red-letter-medias-phantom-menace-review/ |title='Star Wars' Fan Writes 108-Page Rebuttal to Red Letter Media's 'Phantom Menace' Review |publisher=/Film |first=Germain |last=Lussier |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 }}</ref> which Stoklasa mocked in an announcement video for his ''Revenge of the Sith'' review.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTpWzg4aiEU |title= Episode 3 Review is now up ...|publisher=[[YouTube]] |author=Red Letter Media |accessdate=June 3, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDirector [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]], whilst critiquing [[CinemaSins|CinemaSins']] ''Everything Wrong With ...'' video of his film, ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', for bad film criticism masked under the guise of \"satire\", praised Red Letter Media for good film criticism and satire, stating that \"Red Letter Media's Phantom Menace review IS satire.

Among the low-budget features Stoklasa and Bauman have produced and directed on Red Letter Media are the action-comedy film ''[[Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant]]'', made in 2005 and available on [[Netflix]]<ref name=\"heeb\" /> (currently only available for DVD rental, not for streaming); ''The Recovered'', a horror thriller starring [[Tina Krause]]; and ''Feeding Frenzy'', a 2010 [[genre]]-[[parody|spoof]] of puppet monster movies like ''[[Gremlins]]''. ''Feeding Frenzy'' featured Rich Evans as Mr. Plinkett; Evans originated the character in short films, and this feature was filmed before the popularity of the ''Phantom Menace'' review.<ref name = \"gp-interview\"/> Stoklasa's short films are usually dark comedies. Plinkett, played by Evans, appeared in several of them, starting with \"You're Invited\".\n\nStoklasa created and starred in five seasons of the web sitcom ''The Grabowskis'', opposite Dixie Jacobs, about an exaggeratedly trashy and unpleasant sitcom family. Installments of the series were only a few seconds long at first (comically giving more screen time to the lengthy intro than the episode itself), but grew to full episode length over time.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the company announced via a short video that it had completed the feature-length film ''[[Space Cop]]'', which had been in production for at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redlettermedia.com/shorts/space-cop-trailer/|title=Space Cop Trailer #1 - Red Letter Media|website=redlettermedia.com}}</ref> ''Space Cop'' stars Evans in the titular role alongside Stoklasa, who wrote and directed the film. It was made available on January 12, 2016, on Blu-ray for $25 through Red Letter Media's [[Bandcamp]] page. The first run sold out in a matter of hours.\n\n==''Half in the Bag''==\n''Half in the Bag'' is a regularly released series in which Stoklasa and Bauman review films in a more traditional format, albeit with a haphazard and [[Fourth wall|fourth wall breaking]] overarching plot. Stoklasa has described it as a cross between ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'' and a 1980s [[sitcom]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with himself and Bauman playing [[videocassette recorder|VCR]] repairmen who discuss movies whilst finding increasingly convoluted ways of avoiding their scheduled repair work on Mr. Plinkett's VCR.\n\nThe show often features Plinkett portrayed by Evans. Fans often call this iteration of the character \"Fake Plinkett\", but Stoklasa has noted that Evans was the first person to portray Plinkett, with Stoklasa's later portrayal based on Evans's performance. [[Tim Heidecker]], who hosts a satirical movie review show ''[[On Cinema]]'', makes a cameo in episode 37 as the owner of the VCR repair shop who bequeaths employment to Jay and Mike.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1C7UCMmF5g |title=Half in the Bag: Episode 37 - Special guest star Tim Heidecker |last=RedLetterMedia |date=2012-08-07 |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nStoklasa stated that this series would not replace the Plinkett reviews. The first episode premiered on March 12, 2011, with a review of ''[[Drive Angry]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.\n\n[[Graham Linehan]] praised Red Letter Media in an interview with [[United Kingdom|British]] comedian and writer [[Richard Herring]] on ''[[Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast]]''. He spoke particularly about the ''Half in the Bag'' review of ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'', which he described as \"brilliant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzsR1e5NFl4&t=48m20s|title=Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast - with Graham Linehan #111|first=|last=Richard Herring|date=26 August 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==''Best of the Worst''==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{overly detailed|date=August 2019}}\n}}\n\n''Best of the Worst'' is a regularly-released series in which members of Red Letter Media watch and review multiple films ranging from B-movies to instructional videos, sometimes sent in by fans.<ref name=MakeUseOf>{{cite web |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |title=Red Letter Media: Cinema-Themed Comedy For Film Fans [Stuff to Watch] |publisher=MakeUseOf |author=Tim Brookes |date=December 10, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117003120/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/red-letter-media-cinema-themed-comedy-for-film-fans-stuff-to-watch/ |archivedate=January 17, 2014 |df= }}</ref> After viewing and riffing on the films, a rotating panel of four sit to discuss what they just watched, typically expressing further contempt or ridicule for what they have just seen, though occasionally offering praise for films that show uncommon quality or effort. Panels typically consist of any combination of Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, Rich Evans, Jessi Nakles, Jack Packard, Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis, or special guests. Panel participants then individually decide upon which film or video represents the \"Best of the Worst\". Viewing material that is deemed to be insulting, offensive, or especially poor is often destroyed in a creative fashion. Methods of destruction have included dissolving a VHS tape in [[acetone]], forcing a DVD through a [[paper shredder]], dragging a tape around the streets tied to the bumper of a car, and cooking a tape on a charcoal grill alongside cheeseburgers.\n\nCanadian visual effects artists Colin Cunningham and Jim Maxwell, who have worked on numerous television series' and feature films, frequently appear as recurring guests. Special guests on the show have included screenwriters [[Max Landis]] and [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], comic book artist [[Freddie Williams II|Freddie Williams]], actors [[Macaulay Culkin]] and [[Patton Oswalt]], comedian Gillian Bellinger and indie film auteur Len Kabasinski.\n\nSome episodes feature the \"Wheel of the Worst\", in which a wheel is spun to select which films/videos will be watched.<ref name=\"MakeUseOf\"/> Wheel selections are often videos that are either extremely bizarre (such as \"Dog Sitter\", a movie made to appeal to dogs), low budget instructional films, educational films and those which have little modern relevance (such as Chinese-language instructional tapes about how to use [[AOL]]). Videos featured on Wheel of the Worst are most frequently found on VHS tapes. The ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' praised ''Best of the Worst'' for being Red Letter Media's most entertaining series.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140117/entlife/701179987/|title= Hibernating? Chill out with offbeat shows, DVDs |newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] |author=Sean Stangland |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe show occasionally features other gimmicks to randomly select viewing material such as the \"Choose-And-Lose\" and the [[Plinko|Plinketto Board]]. Another subsection of Best of the Worst includes the \"Black Spine Edition\" where the group randomly selects VHS tapes which are missing informational or identification labels on the side of the cassette.\n\nSometimes the crew will review a specific film which they have previously viewed off camera and recommend to fans of poorly-conceived and poorly-executed [[B movie]]s. They refer to reviews of this nature as their \"Spotlight Series\". The first of these reviews featured the film ''Hollywood Cop'' by director [[Amir Shervan]] was released on YouTube on June 21, 2017. In this format, low budget indie movies ''Suburban Sasquatch'', ''Lycan Colony'' and ''The Last Vampire on Earth'' have also been featured.\n\nIn 2019, the crew introduced a 'Hall of Fame' for Best of the Worst, intended to represent the best things that have appeared on the show. There have only been three additions to the hall of fame thus far; actor [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and low-budget films ''Surviving Edged Weapons'' and ''[[Creating Rem Lezar]]''.\n\n==''re:View''==\nOn May 24, 2016, the company released the first episode of a new series called ''re:View''. Compared to the company's other shows, the format is a much more stripped down and straight forward approach to film critique. Two members of Red Letter Media sit in front of a red curtain and offer thoughts and insight on a film that they both enjoy. Films chosen for this feature are often either [[cult film|cult classics]] such as ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' and ''[[Martin (1978 film)|Martin]]'', or well renowned genre-defining films like ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. Clips of the film being discussed are interwoven, typically to lend emphasis to a specific point being made, or to showcase some of the most memorable moments from the film. ''re:View'' has also featured ''[[Star Trek]]'' films and episodes, a particular favorite of Stoklasa's.\n\nFor an episode featuring ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', the screenwriter of the film, [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]], appeared as a guest and spoke about many behind the scenes aspects of the production. A similar insight into the background of a film the Red Letter Media crew enjoyed was shared in a two-part interview series with ''[[Samurai Cop]]'' lead [[Matt Hannon]], though this occurred prior to the creation of the ''re:View'' branding and format. Former child star [[Macaulay Culkin]] made a guest appearance in a 2018 episode reviewing ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'', and has continued to recur in both this series as well as Best of the Worst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM7_oyCZqj0|title=Hackers - reView|first=|last=RedLetterMedia|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/macaulay-culkin-ueberraschender-auftritt-bei-youtube-kritikern-1144705/|title=Macaulay Culkin: \u00dcberraschender Auftritt bei YouTube-Kritikern|date=24 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==''The Nerd Crew: A Pop Culture Podcast''==\nThe first episode being uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 5 January 2017, ''The Nerd Crew'' parodies [[pop culture]] \"[[fanboyism]]\" and video series such as [[Screen Junkies]], [[Collider (website)|Collider]], and [[John Campea|''The John Campea Show'']], with Stoklasa, Bauman and Evans playing \"[[wikt:man child|manchild]]ren\" demonstrating excessive enthusiasm over ''[[Star Wars]]'', the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and other content aimed primarily at a juvenile audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/the-frenzied-fraud-of-forced-fandom/|title=The Frenzied Fraud of Forced Fandom|date=1 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> [[Product placement]], [[native advertising]] and general subservience to entertainment mega-corporations are all satirized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/diese-drei-filmnerds-zerstoeren-rogue-one-und-disney-mit-nur-einem-youtube-video-736791/|title=Diese drei Filmnerds zerst\u00f6ren \"Rogue One\" und Disney mit nur einem YouTube-Video|date=9 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokadr.ru/blog/2017/12/16/5411.shtml|title=5 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438: \"\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\", \"\u0425\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044b\", \"\u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u0414\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0438 \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438|website=kinokadr.ru}}</ref>\n\n== Commentary tracks ==\nSince 2012, Red Letter Media has produced commentary tracks for various films, releasing them on [[Bandcamp]].<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\">{{Cite web|url=https://redlettermedia.bandcamp.com/audio|title=Red Letter Media commentary tracks|last=|first=|date=|website=Red Letter Media|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> These began with three commentary tracks by Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett, but the company has since released tracks by Stoklasa, Bauman, and Evans as themselves.\n\n;Commentary tracks (listed in order of release)<ref name=\"RLMBandcamp\"/>\n{{div col}}\n*''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' (Mike Stoklasa as Mr. Plinkett)\n*''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''\n*''[[Samurai Cop]]''\n*''[[Ghostbusters II]]''\n*''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''\n*''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n*''[[The Terminator]]''\n*''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''\n*''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''\n*''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''\n*''[[Return of the Jedi]]''\n*''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]''\n*''[[Gremlins]]''\n*''[[Rogue One]]''\n*''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]''\n*''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''\n*''[[RoboCop (film)|RoboCop]]''\n*''[[Jingle All the Way]]''\n*''[[Army of Darkness]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==''Previously Recorded''==\nIn July 2014, Red Letter Media affiliates Rich Evans and Jack Packard began a YouTube Video game review channel under the name ''Previously Recorded'' or ''Pre-Rec''.

This platform extended from either the present [[Appalachian Mountains]] or [[Mississippi Valley]] to the present [[Great Basin]]. The craton was covered by shallow, warm, tropical epicontinental or [[epicratonic sea]] (meaning literally \"on the craton\") that had maximum depths of only about 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft) at the shelf edge.

''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.\n\nZipf's law was originally formulated in terms of [[quantitative linguistics]], stating that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the [[Brown Corpus]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gen\u00e7ay|pages=133\u2013153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.\n\nIn human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.\n\nAs long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then\n:<math>\\zeta (s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}<\\infty. \\!</math>\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n\n==Statistical explanation==\n\n[[File:Zipf 30wiki en labels.png|thumbnail|A plot of the rank versus frequency for the first 10 million words in 30 Wikipedias (dumps from October 2015) in a [[log-log]] scale.]]\n\nAlthough Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO'S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF'S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102\u2013108 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref> the reason is still not well understood.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Brillouin]], ''La science et la th\u00e9orie de l'information'', 1959, r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 en 1988, traduction anglaise r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2004</ref> However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts.

The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&nbsp; is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are \"the\", \"of\" and \"and\", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''<sup>0.5</sup>) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'')<sup>2.0</sup>) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]\n\n''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of \"rank data\", in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''<sup>''s''</sup>''\u03b6''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with \"zeta distribution\", since probability distributions are sometimes called \"laws\". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.\n\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f(k;N,q,s)=\\frac{[\\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\\,</math>\n\nThe \"constant\" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].<ref name=Powers1998/>\n\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.<ref name=\"Adamic2000\"/>\n\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N.

To add information from a symbol of probability <math>p</math> into information already stored in a natural number <math>x</math>, we should go to <math>x'</math> such that <math>\\log_2(x') \\approx \\log_2(x) + \\log_2(1/p)</math>, or equivalently <math>x' \\approx x/p</math>.

''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.\n\nZipf's law was originally formulated in terms of [[quantitative linguistics]], stating that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the [[Brown Corpus]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gen\u00e7ay|pages=133\u2013153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

''f''(''k'';&nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.\n\nThe law may also be written:\n\n:<math>f(k;s,N)=\\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}</math>\n\nwhere ''H<sub>N,s</sub>'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].\n\nThe simplest case of Zipf's law is a \"{{sfrac|1|''f''}} function.\" Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur half as often as the first, the third most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|3}} as often as the first, and the ''n''th most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|''n''}} as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.\n\nIn human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.\n\nAs long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then\n:<math>\\zeta (s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}<\\infty. \\!</math>\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n\n==Statistical explanation==\n\n[[File:Zipf 30wiki en labels.png|thumbnail|A plot of the rank versus frequency for the first 10 million words in 30 Wikipedias (dumps from October 2015) in a [[log-log]] scale.]]\n\nAlthough Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO'S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF'S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102\u2013108 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref> the reason is still not well understood.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Brillouin]], ''La science et la th\u00e9orie de l'information'', 1959, r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 en 1988, traduction anglaise r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2004</ref> However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts.

The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&nbsp; is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are \"the\", \"of\" and \"and\", as expected.

These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]\n\n''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of \"rank data\", in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''<sup>''s''</sup>''\u03b6''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with \"zeta distribution\", since probability distributions are sometimes called \"laws\". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.\n\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f(k;N,q,s)=\\frac{[\\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\\,</math>\n\nThe \"constant\" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].<ref name=Powers1998/>\n\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.<ref name=\"Adamic2000\"/>\n\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N.

Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of [[Abraham]] to that of God, such as in the [[Midrash Rabbah]] to Genesis,<ref>Tractate Nedarim</ref> while some Jewish commentators, such as [[Chaim ibn Attar]], write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.\n\n[[Maimonides]], in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that [[Jacob]] separated his son [[Levi]] from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of \"service to God\", specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather [[Abraham]], to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of Levi (\"Shevet Levi\") for eternity (Maimonides, Avodah Zorah 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see [[Targum Yonathan]] to Genesis 32:25, and/or [[Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer]] ch. 37. In midrash, it is written that [[Amram]] the son of [[Kohath]] the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\"Israel\") during their Egyptian Bondage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron.\n\nAt the time of the erection of the [[Tabernacle]], God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his [[Shechinah]] amongst the nation of Israel;\n\n{{quote|And Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve me and I will dwell amidst the sons of Israel and I will be to them a God, and they will know that I (am) God their Master that took them out from the land of Egypt (in order that) I (will) dwell in their midst|Exodus 29:44-46}}\n\nThe majority of [[Chazal]]ic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as [[King David]]<ref>This is based on the text \u05e9\u05d1 \u05dc'''\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9''' with \"Yemini\" referring either to [[King Saul]] of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Bin'''yamin''') whom David was careful not to overthrow ''or'' to the [[Torah]], as per it being referred to as \"from his right hand \u2013 a fire of religion to them\" in Deuteronomy (Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110).</ref> who was a \"righteous king\" (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.<ref>Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32</ref> The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to [[Ahron]] the [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest).<ref>Zohar, vol. 3, p. 53b</ref>\n\n==In Christianity==\n[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]] spoken of as \"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\" ({{Bibleverse||Ps.|110:4|HE}}), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham. As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace\". Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM|date=July 22, 2016}}: \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, 'priest of God Most High', as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique 'high priest after the order of Melchizedek'; 'holy, blameless, unstained',\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek\" at the [[Last Supper]], when he broke and shared bread with his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]]. Catholics interpret more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \"do this in memory of Me\" and \"as often as you can\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as part of the [[Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} \n{{Further|Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], as well as [[Old Testament]] prophets, higher than that of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] authority of [[John the Baptist]] and of the Levites.\n\nAccording to the [[Book of Mormon]], the prophet [[Melchizedek]] preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=13|verse=18}}, Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \"the prince of peace\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34). The priesthood is referred to by the name of Melchizedek because he was such a great high priest (Doctrine & Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=2}}). The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] states that before Melchizedek's day the Priesthood \"was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too-frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in the ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood\" (Doctrine and Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=3-4}}). Initially, the only Melchizedek Priesthood office in the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Elder (LDS Church)|Elder]]. Later revelations extended the office complement to [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Seventy]], [[High Priest (LDS Church)|High Priest]], [[Patriarch (LDS Church)|Patriarch]] and [[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102082300/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=815&cuItem_itemID=1190 WELS Topical Q&A: Hebrews 5:6 - Melchizedek's Importance?] ([[Confessional Lutheran]] perspective)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615061639/http://www.catholic.com/library/Institution_of_the_Mass.asp Melchizedek priesthood] in the theology of the Catholic Mass\n*[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng Melchizedek Priesthood] in the theology of the Latter-day Saints\n*{{CathEncy|wstitle=Melchisedech}}\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3670614 The Mystery of Melchizedek, M.M.Ninan\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Melchizedek Priesthood}}\n[[Category:Religious terminology]]\n[[Category:Jewish theology]]\n[[Category:Melchizedek]]\n[[Category:Lech-Lecha]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Melchizedek (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|200px|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'' \u2013 by [[Dirk Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]], 1464&ndash;67|alt=]]\nThe '''priesthood of Melchizedek''' is a role in Abrahamic religions, modelled on [[Melchizedek]], combining the dual position of king and priest.<ref>Israel's Messiah in the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls - Richard S.

This commission is believed in Judaism to be \"a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] of everlasting priesthood\" (\"[[Brith HaKehuna]]\") and not eligible for replacement by other [[tribes of Israel]].\n\nJudaic [[midrash]] (exegesis) identifies Melchizedek with [[Shem]] the son of [[Noah]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13541-shem|title=SHEM - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Although the [[Book of Genesis]] affirms that Melchizedek was \"priest of God Most High\" (Genesis 14:18), the [[Midrash]] and [[Babylonian Talmud]] maintain that the priesthood held by [[Melchizedek]], who pre-dated the patriarch Levi by five generations (Melchizedek pre-dates Aaron by six generations; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehoth, Amram, Aaron), was given in his stead to Abraham who, in turn, passed it on to his patrilineal descendants, Isaac and then to Jacob. Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of [[Abraham]] to that of God, such as in the [[Midrash Rabbah]] to Genesis,<ref>Tractate Nedarim</ref> while some Jewish commentators, such as [[Chaim ibn Attar]], write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.\n\n[[Maimonides]], in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that [[Jacob]] separated his son [[Levi]] from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of \"service to God\", specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather [[Abraham]], to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of Levi (\"Shevet Levi\") for eternity (Maimonides, Avodah Zorah 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see [[Targum Yonathan]] to Genesis 32:25, and/or [[Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer]] ch. 37. In midrash, it is written that [[Amram]] the son of [[Kohath]] the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\"Israel\") during their Egyptian Bondage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron.\n\nAt the time of the erection of the [[Tabernacle]], God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his [[Shechinah]] amongst the nation of Israel;\n\n{{quote|And Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve me and I will dwell amidst the sons of Israel and I will be to them a God, and they will know that I (am) God their Master that took them out from the land of Egypt (in order that) I (will) dwell in their midst|Exodus 29:44-46}}\n\nThe majority of [[Chazal]]ic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as [[King David]]<ref>based on the text \u05e9\u05d1 \u05dc'''\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9''' with \"Yemini\" referring either to [[King Saul]] of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Bin'''yamin''') whom David was careful not to overthrow ''or'' to the [[Torah]] (as per it being referred to as \"from his right hand -a fire of religion to them\" -Deuteronomy) -Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110</ref> who was a \"righteous king\" (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.<ref>Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32</ref> The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to [[Ahron]] the [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest).<ref>zohar vol. 3 p.53b</ref>\n\n==In Christianity==\n[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]] spoken of as \"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\" ({{Bibleverse||Ps.|110:4|HE}}), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham. As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace\". Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM |date=July 22, 2016 }} \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, \"priest of God Most High,\" as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique \"high priest after the order of Melchizedek\";16 \"holy, blameless, unstained,\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek\" at the [[Last Supper]], when he broke and shared bread with his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]]. Catholics interpret more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \"do this in memory of Me\" and \"as often as you can\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as part of the [[Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} \n{{Further|Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], as well as [[Old Testament]] prophets, higher than that of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] authority of [[John the Baptist]] and of the Levites.\n\nAccording to the [[Book of Mormon]], the prophet [[Melchizedek]] preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=13|verse=18}}, Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \"the prince of peace\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34). The priesthood is referred to by the name of Melchizedek because he was such a great high priest (Doctrine & Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=2}}). The [[Doctrine and Covenants]] states that before Melchizedek's day the Priesthood \"was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God. But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too-frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in the ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood\" (Doctrine and Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=3-4}}). Initially, the only Melchizedek Priesthood office in the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Elder (LDS Church)|Elder]]. Later revelations extended the office complement to [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Seventy]], [[High Priest (LDS Church)|High Priest]], [[Patriarch (LDS Church)|Patriarch]] and [[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102082300/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=815&cuItem_itemID=1190 WELS Topical Q&A: Hebrews 5:6 - Melchizedek's Importance?] ([[Confessional Lutheran]] perspective)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615061639/http://www.catholic.com/library/Institution_of_the_Mass.asp Melchizedek priesthood] in the theology of the Catholic Mass\n*[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng Melchizedek Priesthood] in the theology of the Latter-day Saints\n*{{CathEncy|wstitle=Melchisedech}}\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3670614 The Mystery of Melchizedek, M.M.Ninan\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Melchizedek Priesthood}}\n[[Category:Religious terminology]]\n[[Category:Jewish theology]]\n[[Category:Melchizedek]]\n[[Category:Lech-Lecha]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_of_Melchizedek"}
