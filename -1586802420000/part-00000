Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pok\u00e9mon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pok\u00e9mon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled.

The modernized Su-35 is sometimes referred to as \"Super Flanker\".<ref name=Super_Flanker/>|group=\"N\"}}--> is the designation for two improved derivatives of the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] air-defence fighter. They are single-seat, [[twinjet|twin-engine]], [[Supermaneuverability|supermaneuverable]] aircraft, designed by the [[Sukhoi Design Bureau]] and built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant]].\n\nThe type was originally developed by the [[Soviet Union]] from the Su-27 and was known as the '''Su-27M'''. It incorporated canards and a multi-function radar giving it multi-role capabilities. The first prototype made its [[maiden flight]] in June 1988. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Sukhoi re-designated it as the Su-35 to attract export orders. Fourteen aircraft were produced and used for tests and demonstrations; one example had [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]] engines and was in turn redesignated the [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]]. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that resembled the Su-30MK family.\n\nIn 2003, Sukhoi embarked on a second modernization of the Su-27 to serve as an interim aircraft awaiting the development of the [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] (Su-57) program. Also known as the Su-35, this version has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although it was designed for export, the [[Russian Air Force]] became the launch customer in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S. China's [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] and the [[Indonesian Air Force]] have also placed orders.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Upgraded Su-27{{anchor|Su-27M/Su-35}}===\nThe first aircraft design to receive the Su-35 designation had its origins in the early 1980s, at a time when the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass (\"serial\") production with the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness with the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]].<ref name=JIR>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|publisher=Jane's Information Group|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref> Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp; 69.</ref> the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M).<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;58, 122.</ref>\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35 (Su-27M).png|thumb|upright|left|Planform view of the Su-27M]]\n\nWhile sharing broadly the [[blended wing body|blended wing-body]] design of the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version by the addition of [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]], which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft,<ref name=JIR/> the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing [[leading-edge extension]], redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate [[buffeting]] at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]] and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-''g'' manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 ''g'' on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> More importantly, when working with the [[Relaxed stability|relaxed-stability]] design and the accompanying [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight-control system]], the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120&nbsp;degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;122\u2013123.</ref> Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical tails]], provisions for [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.<ref name=\"Williams p. 119\">Williams 2002, p. 119.</ref><ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;123, 127.</ref>\n\nBesides the increase in manoeuvrability, another feature that distinguished the Su-27M from the original design was the new [[Fire-control system|weapons-control system]]. The centrepiece of this system was the multi-function [[Bars radar|N011 Bars]] (literally \"Leopard\") [[phased array|phased-array]] radar with [[pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] tracking that allowed it to [[Look-down/shoot-down|detect targets below the horizon]].

The modernized Su-35 is sometimes referred to as \"Super Flanker\".<ref name=Super_Flanker/>|group=\"N\"}}--> is the designation for two improved derivatives of the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] air-defence fighter. They are single-seat, [[twinjet|twin-engine]], [[Supermaneuverability|supermaneuverable]] aircraft, designed by the [[Sukhoi Design Bureau]] and built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant]].\n\nThe type was originally developed by the [[Soviet Union]] from the Su-27 and was known as the '''Su-27M'''. It incorporated canards and a multi-function radar giving it multi-role capabilities. The first prototype made its [[maiden flight]] in June 1988. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Sukhoi re-designated it as the Su-35 to attract export orders. Fourteen aircraft were produced and used for tests and demonstrations; one example had [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]] engines and was in turn redesignated the [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]]. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that resembled the Su-30MK family.\n\nIn 2003, Sukhoi embarked on a second modernization of the Su-27 to serve as an interim aircraft awaiting the development of the [[Sukhoi PAK FA]] (Su-57) program. Also known as the Su-35, this version has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although it was designed for export, the [[Russian Air Force]] became the launch customer in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S. China's [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] and the [[Indonesian Air Force]] have also placed orders.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Upgraded Su-27{{anchor|Su-27M/Su-35}}===\nThe first aircraft design to receive the Su-35 designation had its origins in the early 1980s, at a time when the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass (\"serial\") production with the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness with the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]].<ref name=JIR>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|publisher=Jane's Information Group|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref> Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp; 69.</ref> the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the [[Soviet Council of Ministers]] to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M).<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project's existence, under the oversight of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;58, 122.</ref>\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35 (Su-27M).png|thumb|upright|left|Planform view of the Su-27M]]\n\nWhile sharing broadly the [[blended wing body|blended wing-body]] design of the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version by the addition of [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]], which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft,<ref name=JIR/> the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing [[leading-edge extension]], redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate [[buffeting]] at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]] and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-''g'' manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 ''g'' on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> More importantly, when working with the [[Relaxed stability|relaxed-stability]] design and the accompanying [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight-control system]], the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120&nbsp;degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;122\u2013123.</ref> Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller [[Vertical stabilizer|vertical tails]], provisions for [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refuelling]] and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.<ref name=\"Williams p. 119\">Williams 2002, p. 119.</ref><ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;123, 127.</ref>\n\nBesides the increase in manoeuvrability, another feature that distinguished the Su-27M from the original design was the new [[Fire-control system|weapons-control system]]. The centrepiece of this system was the multi-function [[Bars radar|N011 Bars]] (literally \"Leopard\") [[phased array|phased-array]] radar with [[pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] tracking that allowed it to [[Look-down/shoot-down|detect targets below the horizon]].

Although it had canards, the first prototype, like several subsequent aircraft, lacked the many physical alterations of the new design.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;126\u2013127.</ref> It made its first flight after conversion <!--from [[Zhukovsky International Airport|Zhukovsky Airfield]]--> on 28 June 1988, piloted by Oleg Tsoi, followed by the second prototype in January 1989.<ref name=\"Gordon 2007 p. 128\">Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;128.</ref> Following the conversions of the two Su-27M prototypes, the actual production of the aircraft was transferred to the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] where it was carried out by KnAAPO.

With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 [[Farnborough Airshow]], the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;129\u2013131.</ref> The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with [[Dubai Airshow|Dubai]], where [[Viktor Pugachev]] flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators.<ref>Fink 1993, p.&nbsp;44.</ref><ref name=\"Gordon 2007, pp. 134\u2013135\">Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;134\u2013135.</ref> The aircraft thereafter flew in [[ILA Berlin Air Show|Berlin]] and [[Paris Air Show|Paris]], and would be a regular feature at Moscow's [[MAKS Air Show]].<ref name=\"Gordon 2007, pp. 134\u2013135\"/> The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi's unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s;<ref>''Flight International'' 2001, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58/>\n\nAs the flight-test programme of the Su-27M proceeded, engineers discovered that the pilot failed to maintain active control of the aircraft during certain manoeuvres, such as the [[Pugachev's Cobra]]. The eleventh Su-27M ({{Nowrap|T10M-11}}) was therefore equipped with [[thrust-vectoring]] engine nozzles in 1995, and the resultant [[Sukhoi Su-37|Su-37]] [[Technology demonstration|technology demonstrator]] made its first flight on 2 April 1996.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 144.</ref><ref>Velovich 1996, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> It also tested the enhanced N011M radar, as did the twelfth developmental Su-27M.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58>Andrews 2003, pp.&nbsp;58.</ref> The Su-37's ability to maintain a high [[angle of attack]] while flying at close to zero [[airspeed]] attracted considerable press attention.<ref>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> It later received different engines and updated fly-by-wire controls and cockpit systems for evaluation.<ref name=Andrews_2003_p58/>\n\nApart from the single-seat design, a two-seat aircraft was also constructed. Working in cooperation with Sukhoi, KnAAPO's own engineers designed the Su-35UB so as to combine thrust-vectoring engines with features of the Su-27M. Modified from an [[Su-30MKK]] airframe, the aircraft made its first flight on 7 August 2000, and afterwards served as an avionics test-bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;172\u2013173.</ref> While the original Su-27M never entered mass production due to a lack of funding,<ref>Barrie 1997, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Sukhoi refined the Su-27M's use of canards and the Su-37's thrust-vectoring technology and later applied them to the [[Su-30MKI]] two-seat fighter for the [[Indian Air Force]].<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;47.</ref> The tenth Su-27M (T10M-10) also served as a test-bed for the Saturn AL-41FS engine that is intended for the Sukhoi Su-57 (previously known under the acronym \"PAK FA\") jet fighter.<ref name=\"Gordon 2007, p. 173\">Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;173.</ref>\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-35S 07 RED PAS 2013 07.jpg|thumb|Thrust vectoring nozzle on a Sukhoi Su-35S]]\n<!-- [[File:Sukhoi Su-35S 07 RED PAS 2013 10 front landing gear.jpg|thumb|Front landing gear of a Sukhoi Su-35S]] Not enough room for this here now.-->\n\nWith the need to update Russia's aging fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started integrating [[glass cockpit]]s and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate a greater variety of weapons) to existing air force aircraft.

She is best known for her popular rhyming stories for children, especially those illustrated by [[Axel Scheffler]], which include ''[[The Gruffalo]]'', ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' and ''[[Stick Man]]''. She originally wrote songs for children's television but has concentrated on writing books since the words of one of her songs, \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", were made into a children's book in 1993. Of her 184 published works, 64 are widely available in bookshops. The remaining 120 are intended for school use and include her Songbirds phonic reading scheme, which is part of the Oxford University Press's Oxford Reading Tree. I love this woman! She is an ICON. \n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Childhood ===\nDonaldson was born in London and brought up in [[Hampstead]], London, with her younger sister Mary. The family occupied a Victorian three-storey house near [[Hampstead Heath]]. Her parents, sister and their pet cat Geoffrey lived on the ground floor, an aunt and uncle (and later their children, James and Kate) on the first floor and her grandmother on the second floor.\n\nDonaldson's parents, James (always known as Jerry) and Elizabeth, met shortly before the Second World War, which then separated them for six years. Jerry, who had studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Oxford University]], spent most of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp where his knowledge of German earned him the position of an interpreter. Elizabeth, also a good German speaker with a degree in languages, meanwhile did war work in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]].\n\nAfter the war, they were reunited and married, and in 1950 they bought the Hampstead house together with Jerry's mother, his sister Beta and her husband Chris (the two men had met in the P.O.W. camp). When Donaldson was six her father contracted [[polio]] and thereafter was confined to a wheelchair, though he still led an active life, working as a lecturer in the [[Maudsley Hospital]]'s [[Institute of Psychiatry]], where he pioneered genetic studies using the model of identical twins brought up apart.\n\nElizabeth worked as a part-time secretary and helped her boss, Leslie Minchin, translate German [[lieder]] into English. It was a household of music and song: Elizabeth sang with the Hampstead Choral Society, Jerry played the cello in amateur string quartets, and both parents were active members of the Hampstead Music Club. Summer holidays were at Grittleton House in Wiltshire, where Jerry played his cello in a summer school for chamber music, while Julia and Mary romped around and put on musical shows with the other children.\n\nPoetry also featured strongly in Donaldson's early life; she was given ''The Book of a Thousand Poems'' by her father when she was five years old, and her grandmother introduced her to [[Edward Lear]]\u2019s nonsense rhymes. Donaldson attended New End Primary School and then [[Camden School for Girls]]. During her childhood and adolescence she acted (understudying the fairies in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at The [[Old Vic]] where she made the acquaintance of a young [[Judi Dench]] and [[Tom Courtenay]]), sang with the Children's Opera Group, and learned the piano.\n\nA good linguist, she learned French and German at school and later picked up Italian through a summer tutoring job with a family in Naples, so that by the age of 19 she had a good grasp of all three languages.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\">Malcolm Donaldson, 2012</ref>\n\n===University life===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\n\nDonaldson studied Drama and French at [[Bristol University]] (1967\u20131970), graduating with a 2:1 honours degree. During her time there she acted in departmental productions and learnt the guitar. In 1968, she and her friend Maureen Purkis took part in the play ''I am not the Eiffel Tower'' with music composed by [[Colin Sell]], an accomplished young pianist who was studying Spanish and Portuguese at Bristol and who has gone on to appear in BBC Radio 4's ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. Sell's roommate Malcolm Donaldson, a medical student who played left-handed guitar and was a keen amateur actor, came to see the show and subsequently teamed up with Sell, Donaldson and Purkis to sing in the pubs during Bristol University [[Rag Week]] in early 1969. Almost immediately after this Donaldson and Purkis were seconded to live in Paris for six months as part of their degree course where they sang and played their guitars to caf\u00e9 audiences for money. Malcolm joined them in the summer and the trio performed various songs by the [[Beatles]] and from musicals including ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.\n\nAfter several weeks of busking in Paris, Malcolm followed Julia and Maureen to the Avignon Festival. Here his attempts to sleep on their youth hostel floor led to eviction and the trio moved out, sleeping in a camp site and even a field, by which time a deep friendship had been formed. During their time in Paris the group were spotted by a French entrepreneur who auditioned them. While nothing came of this Donaldson and Purkis penned a tune to the traditional French poem \"Metamorphosis\" specifically for the audition, the first time that Donaldson had composed a song for an occasion (apart from the childhood shows).\n\nBy December 1969 Julia and Malcolm had become an item. They began to supply cabaret for the occasional university social event, and in 1970 they visited America, travelling by Greyhound bus from the East to the West coast and busking in Seattle and San Francisco. On their return the duo played in restaurants and began to participate in events as diverse as the [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] Children's Day, an Easter Parade in London and a dental congress dinner \u2013 with Julia Donaldson composing songs specially for these occasions.\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe couple continued to busk in Europe during holidays, including in France and Italy, with Julia Donaldson writing \"The French Busking Song\" in French, and \"The Spaghetti Song\" in Italian. By 1971, Donaldson was working in London at Michael Joseph publishers as a secretary to Anthea Joseph but was also given considerable leeway as a junior editor. At weekends she and Malcolm took part in the Bristol Street Theatre, a group of mainly postgraduate students inspired by the late playwright David Illingworth. The group devised simple, unscripted plays which could be performed in the playgrounds of poor council estates and which recruited children from the audience to take over some of the roles. This was to have a lasting effect on Donaldson's interaction with children in her own shows as an established children's writer.\n\nThe couple were married in September 1972, Donaldson composing an operetta which she and Malcolm, their best man Colin Sell, the bridesmaids and ushers performed at the reception in [[Burgh House]], Hampstead. A picture of the wedding is on display in the house today. Donaldson then worked as a secretary in [[Radio Bristol]] where she also had a weekly slot as short story producer/editor. In August 1974 the couple moved to Brighton where Donaldson had been appointed as editor at Robert Tyndall, a small book publishers. Shortly before this she had sent a tape of songs to BBC Children's Television, and between 1974 and 1978 she wrote regularly for the programme ''[[Play Away]]'', her songs being performed by actors and musicians including [[Toni Arthur]], [[Floella Benjamin]], [[Johnny Ball]], [[Brian Cant]], [[Derek Griffiths]] and musical director [[Jonathan Cohen (musician)|Jonathan Cohen]]. She also wrote occasional songs for ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' and for the ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' programme ''Play Board''. Some of Donaldson's songs \u2013 \"The Luck of the Game\", \"Funny Face\" and \"A Squash and a Squeeze\" \u2013 were recorded at this time for BBC albums.\n\nJulia and Malcolm were involved in the Brighton folk club scene, performing floor spots of comedy songs written by Donaldson, often within days of being composed. The songs were variously influenced by [[Flanders and Swann]], topical affairs and traditional folk tales (the latter inspiring spoofs such as \"The Ballad of Jack Nancy and Fred\", and \"Folk Alphabet\"). Their vinyl album ''First Fourteen''(1977) featured many of these songs, while others were included much later on the CD ''Second Fourteen'' (2006, when  ''First Fourteen'' was also re-mastered as a CD).\n\nDonaldson composed two musicals for children: ''King Grunt's Cake'' (1976) and ''Pirate on the Pier'' (1980) which she and a small cast performed both in London and Brighton. Influenced by their Bristol Street Theatre experience, Donaldson ran a Saturday-morning workshop for children in [[Portslade]] from 1974 to 1976. During these sessions a simple play would be devised, followed by making of props and costumes, rehearsal and then a performance.\n\nIn 1977/6 Donaldson studied at Brighton College of Education for a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] and worked for two years as an English teacher at St Mary's Hall in Brighton until the arrival of their first child Hamish in 1978, after which she never returned to full-time employment. The couple moved to Lyon in France for a year (1979\u201380) with Hamish, returning to Brighton where their second son Alastair was born in 1981.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1983 the family of four moved to Bristol where Malcolm Donaldson was appointed as Senior Registrar in Paediatrics to United Bristol Hospitals. By then the television writing had dried up and the folk scene had waned. Julia Donaldson wrote and sang a few topical songs for adult radio programmes (including one about the Guinness Distillers take-over bid, which appeared on Financial World Tonight), did occasional amateur acting and street theatre, and wrote the songs for the Kingsdown community play ''Nine Trees Shade''. She also became a volunteer in Hamish's primary school, hearing the children read aloud. She devised short plays with the right number of parts for a reading group, rotating the roles until each child had read the whole play. The piece would then be performed to the entire class. This approach seemed to build confidence in reading aloud as well as being enjoyable, and Donaldson stored the plays in a drawer for possible future use.\n\nIn 1989 Malcolm was appointed to Glasgow University as senior lecturer in child health and the family, now five following the arrival of Jesse in 1987, moved to Bearsden.\n\n===1990s===\n\nOnce in Glasgow, Donaldson 'pitched' once again for song-writing commissions with the BBC. Between 1990 and 1994 she wrote for various programmes including ''Thinkabout Science'' (two series) and ''Playdays'', composing songs for presenters and puppets (such as Lizzie and the Whybird) to sing.\n\nIn 1991 Donaldson was contacted by [[Methuen Publishing]] to ask if the words of her song \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", which she had written for the BBC's ''Playboard'' programme in 1975, could be made into a picture book for children. The book was published in 1993, with illustrations by a German artist [[Axel Scheffler]], who was living in London. Publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze'' was a pivotal event for Donaldson . It made her realise that her song-writing talent could be applied to story-writing, and gave her the confidence to open her drawer of simple plays for schoolchildren and to send some samples to an educational publisher. Between 1993 and 1999 she wrote extensively for Heinemann and Ginn, including plays such as ''Birthday Surprise'' for younger classes and ''Top of the Mops'' for reluctant teenage readers, as well as re-tellings of traditional tales. During this time Donaldson started visiting Scottish schools and libraries, occasionally accompanied by Malcolm Donaldson and his guitar.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s when Donaldson was extensively visiting school and libraries, she extended techniques learned in Bristol and Brighton to encourage children to act and sing with her. Following the publication of ''The Gruffalo'' she was invited to book festivals, participating in the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] every year from 1999 onwards, and appearing regularly at Hay, Cheltenham and Bath festivals, as well as at many theatres.\n\n===''The Gruffalo''===\n{{Main|The Gruffalo}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn 1995, while looking for ideas for an educational series of plays based on traditional tales, Donaldson came across a version of a Chinese story about a little girl who escapes being eaten by a tiger by claiming to be the fearsome Queen of the Jungle and inviting him to walk behind her. The tiger misinterprets the terror of the various animals they meet as being related to her rather than him, and flees. Donaldson sensed that this story could be developed into more than an educational item and returned to it later as a possible basis for a picture book. She decided to make the girl a mouse, and chose a fox, owl and snake as woodland rather than jungle creatures but wasn't satisfied with lines like \"They ought to know, they really should / There aren't any tigers in this wood\".\n\nShe then thought of the idea of a monster whose name would end in O (to rhyme with \"doesn't he know\"). \"Gr\" sounded suitably fierce as the start to the monster's name, and filling in the middle with \"uffal\" gave the name Gruffalo, conjuring up the pleasing image of a monster reminiscent of a buffalo but a lot more scary. Even then, ''The Gruffalo'' proved nigh impossible to write but, encouraged by her son Alastair, Donaldson persisted with her idea that the monster, rather than existing in the Deep Dark Wood from the outset, should be a figment of the Mouse's imagination, employed to scare off the fox, owl and snake but then turning out to be a reality. A further objection to the original draft was made by Jesse (by now called Jerry) who asked, \"Mum, why don't the fox, owl and snake just eat the mouse on the spot?\"  This flaw was resolved by inserting the question \"Where are you meeting him? (The Gruffalo)\" and the reply \"Here, by these rocks / And his favourite food is roasted fox\", with similar lines for the remaining two predators.\n\n''The Gruffalo'' was sent to Reid Books in 1995.  Donaldson sent the text to Axel Scheffler, whom she had met only once or twice, briefly, following the publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze''. Within days Macmillan Children's Books made an offer to publish ''The Gruffalo'', which was illustrated by Scheffler and published in 1999.\n\n===Post-''Gruffalo'' era===\n\n''The Gruffalo'' was an immediate success, going on to win several awards, including the [[Smarties Prize]] (1999). It has subsequently been translated into more than 40 languages, sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and has given rise to stage and screen productions by Tall Stories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tallstories.org.uk/the-gruffalo|title=The Gruffalo|publisher=Tall Stories theatre company|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> and Magic Light Pictures. ''The Gruffalo'' was followed by more Donaldson/Scheffler publications by Macmillan: ''[[Monkey Puzzle (book)|Monkey Puzzle]]'' (2000), ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' (2001), ''[[The Smartest Giant in Town]]'' (2002), ''[[The Snail and the Whale]]'' (2003), ''[[The Gruffalo's Child]]'', featuring an only child Gruffalo with a wooden stick doll plus the original cast of Gruffalo, [[Mouse, Fox, Snake and Owl]] (2004), and ''[[Charlie Cook's Favourite Book]]'' (2005). In 2006 Scheffler moved to Alison Green Books who published the duo's ''[[Tiddler (book)|Tiddler]]'' (2007), ''[[Stick Man]]'' (inspired by the Gruffalo's Child's toy) (2008), ''[[Tabby McTat]]'' (2009), ''[[Zog (children's book)|Zog]]'' (2010), ''[[The Highway Rat]]'' (2011), ''[[Superworm (book)|Superworm]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Scarecrows' Wedding]]'' (2014).\n\nSince publication of ''The Gruffalo'', Donaldson has worked with other illustrators including Lydia Monks, David Roberts and Nick Sharratt, who has also illustrated two books of poems by Donaldson, ''Crazy Mayonnaisy Mum''  and ''Wriggle and Roar''. Lydia Monks has illustrated the ''Princess Mirror-Belle'' trilogy, a series of books for 7- to 10-year-olds about a boastful girl who is the mirror reflection of an ordinary girl called Ellen. The inspiration for Mirror-Belle was Hamish's imaginary childhood friend Sammy, who lived behind a wardrobe mirror.\n\nDonaldson is also the author of ''The Giants'' and the ''Joneses'' for children aged 8\u201312 years. Her teenage novel ''Running on the Cracks'' is set in Glasgow and traces the adventures of orphaned half-Chinese Leo (aged 15) who is fleeing from her dodgy uncle in England and trying to find her father's estranged family. She befriends a schoolboy called Finlay, who is loosely based on Donaldson's youngest son Jerry during his days as a paper boy.  ''Running on the Cracks'', whose element of mental illness is drawn from Hamish's hospital experiences won the [[National Association for Special Educational Needs|Nasen award]] in 2011 for its sympathetic and inclusive portrait of Mary, who befriends Leo but then descends into a severe relapse of her bi-polar condition.\n\nDonaldson has also written a phonic reading scheme of short stories comprising 60 books of ''Songbird Phonics'', published by [[Oxford University Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/education/content/primary/series/oxford-reading-tree/songbirds-phonics\n|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Songbird Phonics|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nA typical public event consists of acting out (more or less word-for-word) four stories, and singing three or four songs (mostly from Donaldson's three albums of songs \u2013 ''The Gruffalo Song and Other Songs'', ''Room on the Broom and Other Songs'' and ''The Gruffalo's Child and Other Songs''). There is always a strong element of audience participation, with children (and sometimes their parents) invited on stage to act parts in the stories. Malcolm Donaldson almost always takes part in the events, and they are also often joined by other performers including family members.\n\nDonaldson has also performed jointly with her illustrators, particularly Axel Scheffler and Lydia Monks. She has performed the Donaldson/Scheffler books not only in English but also in German on several tours and at the [[Berlin Festival]]. In 2007, when Malcolm took a sabbatical from his job, he joined Julia on a World Tour, acting and singing in Bermuda, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and America.\n\n===Laureateship===\n\nIn 2011, Donaldson was appointed [[Children's Laureate]] succeeding the illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/childrens-laureate/former-laureates/julia-donaldson|work=[[BookTrust]]|title=Julia Donaldson Children's Laureate 2013-11|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> In keeping with her interest in acting and singing Donaldson has set out to encourage children to perform poetry, plays and dramatised readings to generate a love of books and of reading. Accordingly, she has created a series of ''Plays to Read'' for six characters to be performed in the classroom, written by herself and by other writers such as [[Geraldine McCaughrean]], [[Jeanne Willis]], [[Vivian French]], Steve Skidmore and Steve Barlow. The first 36 of these plays, for early readers, were published by Pearson (2013) with a further 24 plays for older primary-school children to following later in the year. She has also compiled an anthology of ''Poems to Perform'' by groups of children (to be published by Macmillan in 2013) and has created an interactive website called picturebookplays.co.uk which gives guidance as to how selected picture books can be turned into classroom plays.\n\nIn her laureate role Donaldson has campaigned passionately against library cuts and closures, writing articles, meeting ministers and \u2013 with Malcolm Donaldson \u2013 embarking on a 6-week tour of UK libraries in autumn 2012. In all of the 38 libraries the visiting children were requested to perform a short play or song based on a picture book, as well as joining in Donaldson's own stories and songs. The tour was designed to celebrate libraries but also to generate publicity about the plight of some of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\nDonaldson's husband is a

English writer, playwright and performer, and the 2011\u20132013 [[Children's Laureate]]. She is best known for her popular rhyming stories for children, especially those illustrated by [[Axel Scheffler]], which include ''[[The Gruffalo]]'', ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' and ''[[Stick Man]]''. She originally wrote songs for children's television but has concentrated on writing books since the words of one of her songs, \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", were made into a children's book in 1993. Of her 184 published works, 64 are widely available in bookshops. The remaining 120 are intended for school use and include her Songbirds phonic reading scheme, which is part of the Oxford University Press's Oxford Reading Tree.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Childhood ===\nDonaldson was born in London and brought up in [[Hampstead]], London, with her younger sister Mary. The family occupied a Victorian three-storey house near [[Hampstead Heath]]. Her parents, sister and their pet cat Geoffrey lived on the ground floor, an aunt and uncle (and later their children, James and Kate) on the first floor and her grandmother on the second floor.\n\nDonaldson's parents, James (always known as Jerry) and Elizabeth, met shortly before the Second World War, which then separated them for six years. Jerry, who had studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at [[Oxford University]], spent most of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp where his knowledge of German earned him the position of an interpreter. Elizabeth, also a good German speaker with a degree in languages, meanwhile did war work in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]].\n\nAfter the war, they were reunited and married, and in 1950 they bought the Hampstead house together with Jerry's mother, his sister Beta and her husband Chris (the two men had met in the P.O.W. camp). When Donaldson was six her father contracted [[polio]] and thereafter was confined to a wheelchair, though he still led an active life, working as a lecturer in the [[Maudsley Hospital]]'s [[Institute of Psychiatry]], where he pioneered genetic studies using the model of identical twins brought up apart.\n\nElizabeth worked as a part-time secretary and helped her boss, Leslie Minchin, translate German [[lieder]] into English. It was a household of music and song: Elizabeth sang with the Hampstead Choral Society, Jerry played the cello in amateur string quartets, and both parents were active members of the Hampstead Music Club. Summer holidays were at Grittleton House in Wiltshire, where Jerry played his cello in a summer school for chamber music, while Julia and Mary romped around and put on musical shows with the other children.\n\nPoetry also featured strongly in Donaldson's early life; she was given ''The Book of a Thousand Poems'' by her father when she was five years old, and her grandmother introduced her to [[Edward Lear]]\u2019s nonsense rhymes. Donaldson attended New End Primary School and then [[Camden School for Girls]]. During her childhood and adolescence she acted (understudying the fairies in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at The [[Old Vic]] where she made the acquaintance of a young [[Judi Dench]] and [[Tom Courtenay]]), sang with the Children's Opera Group, and learned the piano.\n\nA good linguist, she learned French and German at school and later picked up Italian through a summer tutoring job with a family in Naples, so that by the age of 19 she had a good grasp of all three languages.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\">Malcolm Donaldson, 2012</ref>\n\n===University life===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\n\nDonaldson studied Drama and French at [[Bristol University]] (1967\u20131970), graduating with a 2:1 honours degree. During her time there she acted in departmental productions and learnt the guitar. In 1968, she and her friend Maureen Purkis took part in the play ''I am not the Eiffel Tower'' with music composed by [[Colin Sell]], an accomplished young pianist who was studying Spanish and Portuguese at Bristol and who has gone on to appear in BBC Radio 4's ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. Sell's roommate Malcolm Donaldson, a medical student who played left-handed guitar and was a keen amateur actor, came to see the show and subsequently teamed up with Sell, Donaldson and Purkis to sing in the pubs during Bristol University [[Rag Week]] in early 1969. Almost immediately after this Donaldson and Purkis were seconded to live in Paris for six months as part of their degree course where they sang and played their guitars to caf\u00e9 audiences for money. Malcolm joined them in the summer and the trio performed various songs by the [[Beatles]] and from musicals including ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.\n\nAfter several weeks of busking in Paris, Malcolm followed Julia and Maureen to the Avignon Festival. Here his attempts to sleep on their youth hostel floor led to eviction and the trio moved out, sleeping in a camp site and even a field, by which time a deep friendship had been formed. During their time in Paris the group were spotted by a French entrepreneur who auditioned them. While nothing came of this Donaldson and Purkis penned a tune to the traditional French poem \"Metamorphosis\" specifically for the audition, the first time that Donaldson had composed a song for an occasion (apart from the childhood shows).\n\nBy December 1969 Julia and Malcolm had become an item. They began to supply cabaret for the occasional university social event, and in 1970 they visited America, travelling by Greyhound bus from the East to the West coast and busking in Seattle and San Francisco. On their return the duo played in restaurants and began to participate in events as diverse as the [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] Children's Day, an Easter Parade in London and a dental congress dinner \u2013 with Julia Donaldson composing songs specially for these occasions.\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe couple continued to busk in Europe during holidays, including in France and Italy, with Julia Donaldson writing \"The French Busking Song\" in French, and \"The Spaghetti Song\" in Italian. By 1971, Donaldson was working in London at Michael Joseph publishers as a secretary to Anthea Joseph but was also given considerable leeway as a junior editor. At weekends she and Malcolm took part in the Bristol Street Theatre, a group of mainly postgraduate students inspired by the late playwright David Illingworth. The group devised simple, unscripted plays which could be performed in the playgrounds of poor council estates and which recruited children from the audience to take over some of the roles. This was to have a lasting effect on Donaldson's interaction with children in her own shows as an established children's writer.\n\nThe couple were married in September 1972, Donaldson composing an operetta which she and Malcolm, their best man Colin Sell, the bridesmaids and ushers performed at the reception in [[Burgh House]], Hampstead. A picture of the wedding is on display in the house today. Donaldson then worked as a secretary in [[Radio Bristol]] where she also had a weekly slot as short story producer/editor. In August 1974 the couple moved to Brighton where Donaldson had been appointed as editor at Robert Tyndall, a small book publishers. Shortly before this she had sent a tape of songs to BBC Children's Television, and between 1974 and 1978 she wrote regularly for the programme ''[[Play Away]]'', her songs being performed by actors and musicians including [[Toni Arthur]], [[Floella Benjamin]], [[Johnny Ball]], [[Brian Cant]], [[Derek Griffiths]] and musical director [[Jonathan Cohen (musician)|Jonathan Cohen]]. She also wrote occasional songs for ''[[Play School (UK TV series)|Play School]]'' and for the ''[[Watch with Mother]]'' programme ''Play Board''. Some of Donaldson's songs \u2013 \"The Luck of the Game\", \"Funny Face\" and \"A Squash and a Squeeze\" \u2013 were recorded at this time for BBC albums.\n\nJulia and Malcolm were involved in the Brighton folk club scene, performing floor spots of comedy songs written by Donaldson, often within days of being composed. The songs were variously influenced by [[Flanders and Swann]], topical affairs and traditional folk tales (the latter inspiring spoofs such as \"The Ballad of Jack Nancy and Fred\", and \"Folk Alphabet\"). Their vinyl album ''First Fourteen''(1977) featured many of these songs, while others were included much later on the CD ''Second Fourteen'' (2006, when  ''First Fourteen'' was also re-mastered as a CD).\n\nDonaldson composed two musicals for children: ''King Grunt's Cake'' (1976) and ''Pirate on the Pier'' (1980) which she and a small cast performed both in London and Brighton. Influenced by their Bristol Street Theatre experience, Donaldson ran a Saturday-morning workshop for children in [[Portslade]] from 1974 to 1976. During these sessions a simple play would be devised, followed by making of props and costumes, rehearsal and then a performance.\n\nIn 1977/6 Donaldson studied at Brighton College of Education for a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] and worked for two years as an English teacher at St Mary's Hall in Brighton until the arrival of their first child Hamish in 1978, after which she never returned to full-time employment. The couple moved to Lyon in France for a year (1979\u201380) with Hamish, returning to Brighton where their second son Alastair was born in 1981.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1983 the family of four moved to Bristol where Malcolm Donaldson was appointed as Senior Registrar in Paediatrics to United Bristol Hospitals. By then the television writing had dried up and the folk scene had waned. Julia Donaldson wrote and sang a few topical songs for adult radio programmes (including one about the Guinness Distillers take-over bid, which appeared on Financial World Tonight), did occasional amateur acting and street theatre, and wrote the songs for the Kingsdown community play ''Nine Trees Shade''. She also became a volunteer in Hamish's primary school, hearing the children read aloud. She devised short plays with the right number of parts for a reading group, rotating the roles until each child had read the whole play. The piece would then be performed to the entire class. This approach seemed to build confidence in reading aloud as well as being enjoyable, and Donaldson stored the plays in a drawer for possible future use.\n\nIn 1989 Malcolm was appointed to Glasgow University as senior lecturer in child health and the family, now five following the arrival of Jesse in 1987, moved to Bearsden.\n\n===1990s===\n\nOnce in Glasgow, Donaldson 'pitched' once again for song-writing commissions with the BBC. Between 1990 and 1994 she wrote for various programmes including ''Thinkabout Science'' (two series) and ''Playdays'', composing songs for presenters and puppets (such as Lizzie and the Whybird) to sing.\n\nIn 1991 Donaldson was contacted by [[Methuen Publishing]] to ask if the words of her song \"A Squash and a Squeeze\", which she had written for the BBC's ''Playboard'' programme in 1975, could be made into a picture book for children. The book was published in 1993, with illustrations by a German artist [[Axel Scheffler]], who was living in London. Publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze'' was a pivotal event for Donaldson . It made her realise that her song-writing talent could be applied to story-writing, and gave her the confidence to open her drawer of simple plays for schoolchildren and to send some samples to an educational publisher. Between 1993 and 1999 she wrote extensively for Heinemann and Ginn, including plays such as ''Birthday Surprise'' for younger classes and ''Top of the Mops'' for reluctant teenage readers, as well as re-tellings of traditional tales. During this time Donaldson started visiting Scottish schools and libraries, occasionally accompanied by Malcolm Donaldson and his guitar.<ref name=\"Malcolm Donaldson, 2012\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s when Donaldson was extensively visiting school and libraries, she extended techniques learned in Bristol and Brighton to encourage children to act and sing with her. Following the publication of ''The Gruffalo'' she was invited to book festivals, participating in the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] every year from 1999 onwards, and appearing regularly at Hay, Cheltenham and Bath festivals, as well as at many theatres.\n\n===''The Gruffalo''===\n{{Main|The Gruffalo}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn 1995, while looking for ideas for an educational series of plays based on traditional tales, Donaldson came across a version of a Chinese story about a little girl who escapes being eaten by a tiger by claiming to be the fearsome Queen of the Jungle and inviting him to walk behind her. The tiger misinterprets the terror of the various animals they meet as being related to her rather than him, and flees. Donaldson sensed that this story could be developed into more than an educational item and returned to it later as a possible basis for a picture book. She decided to make the girl a mouse, and chose a fox, owl and snake as woodland rather than jungle creatures but wasn't satisfied with lines like \"They ought to know, they really should / There aren't any tigers in this wood\".\n\nShe then thought of the idea of a monster whose name would end in O (to rhyme with \"doesn't he know\"). \"Gr\" sounded suitably fierce as the start to the monster's name, and filling in the middle with \"uffal\" gave the name Gruffalo, conjuring up the pleasing image of a monster reminiscent of a buffalo but a lot more scary. Even then, ''The Gruffalo'' proved nigh impossible to write but, encouraged by her son Alastair, Donaldson persisted with her idea that the monster, rather than existing in the Deep Dark Wood from the outset, should be a figment of the Mouse's imagination, employed to scare off the fox, owl and snake but then turning out to be a reality. A further objection to the original draft was made by Jesse (by now called Jerry) who asked, \"Mum, why don't the fox, owl and snake just eat the mouse on the spot?\"  This flaw was resolved by inserting the question \"Where are you meeting him? (The Gruffalo)\" and the reply \"Here, by these rocks / And his favourite food is roasted fox\", with similar lines for the remaining two predators.\n\n''The Gruffalo'' was sent to Reid Books in 1995.  Donaldson sent the text to Axel Scheffler, whom she had met only once or twice, briefly, following the publication of ''A Squash and a Squeeze''. Within days Macmillan Children's Books made an offer to publish ''The Gruffalo'', which was illustrated by Scheffler and published in 1999.\n\n===Post-''Gruffalo'' era===\n\n''The Gruffalo'' was an immediate success, going on to win several awards, including the [[Smarties Prize]] (1999). It has subsequently been translated into more than 40 languages, sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and has given rise to stage and screen productions by Tall Stories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tallstories.org.uk/the-gruffalo|title=The Gruffalo|publisher=Tall Stories theatre company|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> and Magic Light Pictures. ''The Gruffalo'' was followed by more Donaldson/Scheffler publications by Macmillan: ''[[Monkey Puzzle (book)|Monkey Puzzle]]'' (2000), ''[[Room on the Broom]]'' (2001), ''[[The Smartest Giant in Town]]'' (2002), ''[[The Snail and the Whale]]'' (2003), ''[[The Gruffalo's Child]]'', featuring an only child Gruffalo with a wooden stick doll plus the original cast of Gruffalo, [[Mouse, Fox, Snake and Owl]] (2004), and ''[[Charlie Cook's Favourite Book]]'' (2005). In 2006 Scheffler moved to Alison Green Books who published the duo's ''[[Tiddler (book)|Tiddler]]'' (2007), ''[[Stick Man]]'' (inspired by the Gruffalo's Child's toy) (2008), ''[[Tabby McTat]]'' (2009), ''[[Zog (children's book)|Zog]]'' (2010), ''[[The Highway Rat]]'' (2011), ''[[Superworm (book)|Superworm]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Scarecrows' Wedding]]'' (2014).\n\nSince publication of ''The Gruffalo'', Donaldson has worked with other illustrators including Lydia Monks, David Roberts and Nick Sharratt, who has also illustrated two books of poems by Donaldson, ''Crazy Mayonnaisy Mum''  and ''Wriggle and Roar''. Lydia Monks has illustrated the ''Princess Mirror-Belle'' trilogy, a series of books for 7- to 10-year-olds about a boastful girl who is the mirror reflection of an ordinary girl called Ellen. The inspiration for Mirror-Belle was Hamish's imaginary childhood friend Sammy, who lived behind a wardrobe mirror.\n\nDonaldson is also the author of ''The Giants'' and the ''Joneses'' for children aged 8\u201312 years. Her teenage novel ''Running on the Cracks'' is set in Glasgow and traces the adventures of orphaned half-Chinese Leo (aged 15) who is fleeing from her dodgy uncle in England and trying to find her father's estranged family. She befriends a schoolboy called Finlay, who is loosely based on Donaldson's youngest son Jerry during his days as a paper boy.  ''Running on the Cracks'', whose element of mental illness is drawn from Hamish's hospital experiences won the [[National Association for Special Educational Needs|Nasen award]] in 2011 for its sympathetic and inclusive portrait of Mary, who befriends Leo but then descends into a severe relapse of her bi-polar condition.\n\nDonaldson has also written a phonic reading scheme of short stories comprising 60 books of ''Songbird Phonics'', published by [[Oxford University Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/education/content/primary/series/oxford-reading-tree/songbirds-phonics\n|work=[[Oxford University Press]]|title=Songbird Phonics|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nA typical public event consists of acting out (more or less word-for-word) four stories, and singing three or four songs (mostly from Donaldson's three albums of songs \u2013 ''The Gruffalo Song and Other Songs'', ''Room on the Broom and Other Songs'' and ''The Gruffalo's Child and Other Songs''). There is always a strong element of audience participation, with children (and sometimes their parents) invited on stage to act parts in the stories. Malcolm Donaldson almost always takes part in the events, and they are also often joined by other performers including family members.\n\nDonaldson has also performed jointly with her illustrators, particularly Axel Scheffler and Lydia Monks. She has performed the Donaldson/Scheffler books not only in English but also in German on several tours and at the [[Berlin Festival]]. In 2007, when Malcolm took a sabbatical from his job, he joined Julia on a World Tour, acting and singing in Bermuda, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and America.\n\n===Laureateship===\n\nIn 2011, Donaldson was appointed [[Children's Laureate]] succeeding the illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/childrens-laureate/former-laureates/julia-donaldson|work=[[BookTrust]]|title=Julia Donaldson Children's Laureate 2013-11|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref> In keeping with her interest in acting and singing Donaldson has set out to encourage children to perform poetry, plays and dramatised readings to generate a love of books and of reading. Accordingly, she has created a series of ''Plays to Read'' for six characters to be performed in the classroom, written by herself and by other writers such as [[Geraldine McCaughrean]], [[Jeanne Willis]], [[Vivian French]], Steve Skidmore and Steve Barlow. The first 36 of these plays, for early readers, were published by Pearson (2013) with a further 24 plays for older primary-school children to following later in the year. She has also compiled an anthology of ''Poems to Perform'' by groups of children (to be published by Macmillan in 2013) and has created an interactive website called picturebookplays.co.uk which gives guidance as to how selected picture books can be turned into classroom plays.\n\nIn her laureate role Donaldson has campaigned passionately against library cuts and closures, writing articles, meeting ministers and \u2013 with Malcolm Donaldson \u2013 embarking on a 6-week tour of UK libraries in autumn 2012. In all of the 38 libraries the visiting children were requested to perform a short play or song based on a picture book, as well as joining in Donaldson's own stories and songs. The tour was designed to celebrate libraries but also to generate publicity about the plight of some of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\nDonaldson's husband is a

The State of Thuringia was restored with slightly altered borders during [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\n=== Sons and daughters of the city ===\n\n* [[Otto Hammann]] (1852-1928), jurist\n* J\u00f6rg Schneider (born 1948), paleontologist\n* [[Christina Grosse]] (born 1970),  actress\n\n=== People who are connected to Blankenhain ===\n\n* Johann Christoph Bach (1689-1740), organist, cousin of Johann Sebastian Bach\n* [[Max Burchartz]] (1887-1961), graphican and painter, lived for a long time in Blankenhain\n* [[Wilhelm Hegeler]] (1870-1943), writer, lived for several years in Blankenhain\n* Max Oehler (1881-1943), painter, had a garden in Blankenhain, painted the city and its surroundings\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.blankenhain.de/}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Blankenhain}}\n* [[File:Wikisource-logo.svg|16x16px|link=|alt=]] Wikisource has texts related to Blankenhain:\n** [[:s:de:Topographia Superioris Saxoniae: Blanckenhain|Blanckenhain]] in the ''{{lang|la|Topographia Superioris Saxoniae}}'' (by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] and [[Martin Zeiler]])\n** \"{{lang|de|[[:s:de:Der Galgenbaum bei Blankenhain|Der Galgenbaum bei Blankenhain]]}}\" [\"The Gallows-tree of Blankenhain\"] from ''{{lang|de|Der Sagenschatz des K\u00f6nigreichs Sachsen}}'' [''The Folklore of the Kingdom of Saxony''] by [[Johann Georg Theodor Gr\u00e4sse]]\n\n\n{{Cities and towns in Weimarer Land (district)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Weimarer Land]]\n[[Category:Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]]\n[[Category:Bezirk Erfurt]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankenhain"}
