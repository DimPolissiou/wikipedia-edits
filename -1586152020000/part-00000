tenures in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), and [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), where he worked as a wrestler and [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. \n\nMartin held a dozen championships between ECW, WCW, and the WWF and is a five-time [[Professional wrestling

He gained attention when he won a [[NWA World Title Tournament|tournament]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, where he publicly rejected the NWA title belt and helped ECW in evolving from an NWA territory to a nationwide phenomenon. Within ECW, he was dubbed \"The Franchise\" in reference to his status as the [[franchise player]] of the promotion. WWE, who purchased that organization, asserted: \"Without Shane Douglas, there would have been no ECW.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/shane-douglas|title=Shane Douglas biography|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref> He headlined many [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events|events]] for the ECW including three editions of the company's premier [[pay-per-view]] event [[November to Remember]] in [[November to Remember (1996)|1996]], [[November to Remember (1997)|1997]] and [[November to Remember (1998)|1998]].\n\n==Early life==\nMartin was born in [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania]], one of six children of a veteran of [[World War II]], who died in 1991.<ref name=Franchise/> He graduated ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'' from [[Bethany College (Bethany, West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in 1986 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[history]] and [[political science]].<ref name=Franchise/> He is an alumnus of the Psi chapter of [[Beta Theta Pi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psibeta.net/rollviewer.htm|title=Shane Douglas' (Troy Martin's) roll number|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607005432/http://www.psibeta.net/rollviewer.htm|archivedate=2009-06-07}}</ref> After earning his degrees, he was offered to join the [[Saba University School of Medicine]]<ref name=Franchise/> but declined in order to continue wrestling.\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early years (1982\u20131989)===\nMartin was trained by [[Dominic DeNucci]] in the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], alongside [[Mick Foley]] in the mid-1980s.<ref>Mick Foley.

Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.92)</ref> In 1986, he wrestled [[Randy Savage]] at a ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' taping using his real name. He also wrestled \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff in the debut episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'', once again using his real name. Later that year, he began wrestling as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] for the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF) using the name Shane Douglas,<ref name=\"encyclopedia271\">{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/271 271]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref> which was given to him by [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|\"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert]] and [[Missy Hyatt]] (the \"Douglas\" last name was inspired by [[Michael Douglas]], who at the time had just appeared in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''). Douglas defeated Gilbert for the [[UWF Television Championship]] on August 3, 1987, but did not rise above mid-card status. Douglas soon lost the title on September 2 to [[Terry Taylor]].\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling (1989\u20131990)===\nEventually, he signed with the [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), member of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). He retained his Shane Douglas ring name and was put into a [[tag team]] of [[Skateboarding|skateboarders]] known as The Dynamic Dudes with [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]] (John Laurinaitis, the younger brother of [[Road Warrior Animal]]).<ref name=WCWbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcw.com/2000/superstars/franchise/|title=WCW profile|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817233028/http://www.wcw.com/2000/superstars/franchise|archivedate=August 17, 2000}}</ref><ref name=mick156>Foley, Mick.

He ended up turning on Douglas and Ace and the teams [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] for a couple of months. Cornette's turn was to have established The Dynamic Dudes as a top fan favorite tag team, but the turn backfired and made [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] more popular than they already were.<ref name=\"https\"/>\n\nThe Dynamic Dudes broke up in 1990 after Ace began competing progressively more for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), which was breaking its ties to the NWA. Jim Cornette also states that the end of the Dynamic Dudes came when Douglas went over his head to Jim Herd about having a finish changed to make him look stronger. Cornette, who was part of the booking committee, washed his hands of working with them afterwards. The Dudes would last wrestle together in March 1990, and Douglas soon left WCW and wrestled on the American [[independent circuit]].<ref name=\"https\"/> <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm</ref>\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1990\u20131991)===\nIn 1990, Douglas signed a deal with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and made his debut on the June 18 episode of [[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]], defeating Bob Bradley, in a match taped in Toronto, Ontario on May 27.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm</ref> Douglas remained undefeated in his first month, defeating Bob Bradley, [[Paul Diamond]], and [[Steve Lombardi]] in a series of matches. He then moved up to begin a house show series in late June against [[Haku (wrestler)|Haku]] and suffered his first loss on June 28 in Denver, CO. He remained without a win in subsequent rematches. He made his televised debut on the promotion's flagship show [[WWF Superstars]] on the August 26 Summerslam pre-show, teaming with Mark Thomas in a loss to [[The Orient Express]]. \n\nIn August 1991 he received his first break when he was tapped as the temporary replacement to an injured [[Shawn Michaels]] in [[The Rockers]] tag-team. Douglas teamed with Jannette six times in matches against The Orient Express. On August 27 he made his PPV debut, defeating [[Buddy Rose]] in a dark match at [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam '90]]. On the September 17 episode of Prime Time Wrestling Douglas wrestled Haku to a draw, and he was largely undefeated against low level competition throughout the fall. At the [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series '90]] Douglas defeated Buddy Rose in another dark match, and on January 3rd, 1991 at a house show in Scranton, PA he scored the biggest victory of his nascent WWF career when he upset [[Dino Bravo]]. <ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm</ref> Four days later on the January 7th, 1991 episode of Prime Time Wrestling he would pin Haku, and was strongly positioned as a rising young star. \n\nHis most memorable WWF performance took place at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991 Royal Rumble]], where he entered as the 17th entrant and lasted for 26 minutes and 23 seconds before being eliminated by [[Brian Knobbs]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble2.html#91|title=Royal Rumble 1991 entrances and eliminations|work=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2017-01-01}}</ref> This was the seventh longest time for any wrestler in the Royal Rumble's first four years.

He returned on May 8th in Youngstown, OH and lost to [[Ricky Steamboat]]. In June he returned for a pair of house shows and was defeated by [[The Iron Sheik|Colonel Mustafa]]. He made his final televised appearance on the June 15th episode of Prime Time Wrestling, losing to Dino Bravo in a match taped at Madison Square Garden.

Carluzzo, a high-ranking NWA official, apparently was talking about a show Shane no showed because he was worried about pay. The promoter kept backing out of parts of the agreement and in the end wanted Shane to drive instead of fly as was planned in the arrangement.

{"title_page": "Gene prediction", "text_new": "[[File:Gene structure.svg|thumbnail|350px|Structure of a eukaryotic gene]]\nIn [[computational biology]], '''gene prediction''' or '''gene finding''' refers to the process of identifying the regions of genomic DNA that encode [[genes]]. This includes protein-coding [[gene]]s as well as [[RNA gene]]s, but may also include prediction of other functional elements such as [[regulatory regions]]. Gene finding is one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a species once it has been [[Sequencing|sequenced]].\n\nIn its earliest days, \"gene finding\" was based on painstaking experimentation on living cells and organisms.

Given an mRNA sequence, it is trivial to derive a unique genomic DNA sequence from which it had to have been [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Given a protein sequence, a  family of possible coding DNA sequences can be derived by reverse translation of the [[genetic code]]. Once candidate DNA sequences have been determined, it is a relatively straightforward algorithmic problem to efficiently search a target genome for matches, complete or partial, and exact or inexact. Given a sequence, local alignment algorithms such as [[BLAST]], [[FASTA]] and [[Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm|Smith-Waterman]] look for regions of similarity between the target sequence and possible candidate matches. Matches can be complete or partial, and exact or inexact. The success of this approach is limited by the contents and accuracy of the sequence database.\n\nA high degree of similarity to a known messenger RNA or protein product is strong evidence that a region of a target genome is a protein-coding gene. However, to apply this approach systemically requires extensive sequencing of mRNA and protein products. Not only is this expensive, but in complex organisms, only a subset of all genes in the organism's genome are expressed at any given time, meaning that extrinsic evidence for many genes is not readily accessible in any single cell culture. Thus, to collect extrinsic evidence for most or all of the genes in a complex organism requires the study of many hundreds or thousands of [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|cell types]], which presents further difficulties. For example, some human genes may be expressed only during development as an embryo or fetus, which might be difficult to study for ethical reasons.\n\nDespite these difficulties, extensive transcript and protein sequence databases have been generated for human as well as other important model organisms in biology, such as mice and yeast. For example, the [[RefSeq]] database contains transcript and protein sequence from many different species, and the [[Ensembl]] system comprehensively maps this evidence to human and several other genomes. It is, however, likely that these databases are both incomplete and contain small but significant amounts of erroneous data.\n\nNew high-throughput [[transcriptome]] sequencing technologies such as [[RNA-Seq]] and [[ChIP-sequencing]] open opportunities for incorporating additional extrinsic evidence into gene prediction and validation, and allow structurally rich and more accurate alternative to previous methods of measuring [[gene expression]] such as [[expressed sequence tag]] or [[DNA microarray]].\n\nMajor challenges involved in gene prediction involve dealing with sequencing errors in raw DNA data, dependence on the quality of the [[sequence assembly]], handling short reads, [[frameshift mutation]]s, [[overlapping gene]]s and incomplete genes.\n\nIn prokaryotes it's essential to consider [[horizontal gene transfer]] when searching for gene sequence homology. An additional important factor underused in current gene detection tools is existence of gene clusters \u2014 [[operon]]s (which are functioning units of [[DNA]] containing a cluster of [[gene]]s under the control of a single [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]]) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most popular gene detectors treat each gene in isolation, independent of others, which is not biologically accurate.\n\n== ''Ab initio'' methods ==\nAb Initio gene prediction is an intrinsic method based on gene content and signal detection. Because of the inherent expense and difficulty in obtaining extrinsic evidence for many genes, it is also necessary to resort to ''[[ab initio]]'' gene finding, in which the [[genomic]] [[DNA sequence]] alone is systematically searched for certain tell-tale signs of protein-coding genes. These signs can be broadly categorized as either ''signals'', specific sequences that indicate the presence of a gene nearby, or ''content'', statistical properties of the protein-coding sequence itself. ''Ab initio'' gene finding might be more accurately characterized as gene ''prediction'', since extrinsic evidence is generally required to conclusively establish that a putative gene is functional.\n[[File:Gene Prediction.png|thumb|This picture shows how Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can be used for gene prediction. Gene prediction is the process of determining where a coding gene might be in a genomic sequence. Functional proteins must begin with a Start codon (where DNA transcription begins), and end with a Stop codon (where transcription ends). By looking at where those codons might fall in a DNA sequence, one can see where a functional protein might be located. This is important in gene prediction because it can reveal where coding genes are in an entire genomic sequence. In this example, a functional protein can be discovered using ORF3 because it begins with a Start codon, has multiple amino acids, and then ends with a Stop codon, all within the same reading frame.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|last=Madigan|first=Michael T.|last2=Martinko|first2=John M.|last3=Bender|first3=Kelly S.|last4=Buckley|first4=Daniel H.|last5=Stahl|first5=David | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Pearson|year=2015|isbn=9780321897398|edition=14th|location=Boston }}</ref>]]\nIn the genomes of [[prokaryotes]], genes have specific and relatively well-understood [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences (signals), such as the [[Pribnow box]] and [[transcription factor]] [[binding site]]s, which are easy to systematically identify. Also, the sequence coding for a protein occurs as one contiguous [[open reading frame]] (ORF), which is typically many hundred or thousands of [[base pair]]s long. The statistics of [[stop codon]]s are such that even finding an open reading frame of this length is a fairly informative sign. (Since 3 of the 64 possible codons in the genetic code are stop codons, one would expect a stop codon approximately every 20\u201325 codons, or 60\u201375 base pairs, in a [[random sequence]].) Furthermore, protein-coding DNA has certain [[Frequency|periodicities]] and other statistical properties that are easy to detect in sequence of this length. These characteristics make prokaryotic gene finding relatively straightforward, and well-designed systems are able to achieve high levels of accuracy.\n\n''Ab initio'' gene finding in [[eukaryotes]], especially complex organisms like humans, is considerably more challenging for several reasons. First, the promoter and other regulatory signals in these genomes are more complex and less well-understood than in prokaryotes, making them more difficult to reliably recognize. Two classic examples of signals identified by eukaryotic gene finders are [[CpG island]]s and binding sites for a [[Polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]].\n\nSecond, [[RNA splicing|splicing]] mechanisms employed by eukaryotic cells mean that a particular protein-coding sequence in the genome is divided into several parts ([[exons]]), separated by non-coding sequences ([[introns]]). (Splice sites are themselves another signal that eukaryotic gene finders are often designed to identify.) A typical protein-coding gene in humans might be divided into a dozen exons, each less than two hundred base pairs in length, and some as short as twenty to thirty. It is therefore much more difficult to detect periodicities and other known content properties of protein-coding DNA in eukaryotes.\n\nAdvanced gene finders for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes typically use complex [[probabilistic model]]s, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs) to combine information from a variety of different signal and content measurements. The [[GLIMMER]] system is a widely used and highly accurate gene finder for prokaryotes. [[GeneMark]] is another popular approach. Eukaryotic ''ab initio'' gene finders, by comparison, have achieved only limited success; notable examples are the [[GENSCAN]] and [[geneid]] programs. The SNAP gene finder is HMM-based like Genscan, and attempts to be more adaptable to different organisms, addressing problems related to using a gene finder on a genome sequence that it was not trained against.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Korf I | title = Gene finding in novel genomes | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 5 | pages = 59 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15144565 | pmc = 421630 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-5-59 }}</ref> A few recent approaches like mSplicer,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = R\u00e4tsch G, Sonnenburg S, Srinivasan J, Witte H, M\u00fcller KR, Sommer RJ, Sch\u00f6lkopf B | title = Improving the Caenorhabditis elegans genome annotation using machine learning | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = e20 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17319737 | pmc = 1808025 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030020 }}</ref> CONTRAST,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross SS, Do CB, Sirota M, Batzoglou S | title = CONTRAST: a discriminative, phylogeny-free approach to multiple informant de novo gene prediction | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = R269 | date = 2007-12-20 | pmid = 18096039 | pmc = 2246271 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-12-r269 }}</ref> or [[mGene]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schweikert G, Behr J, Zien A, Zeller G, Ong CS, Sonnenburg S, R\u00e4tsch G | title = mGene.web: a web service for accurate computational gene finding | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W312\u20136 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19494180 | pmc = 2703990 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp479 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19494180 }}</ref> also use [[machine learning]] techniques like [[support vector machines]] for successful gene prediction.

The output at each position is a score based on whether the network thinks the window contains a donor splice site or an acceptor splice site. Larger windows offer more accuracy but also require more computational power. A neural network is an example of a signal sensor as its goal is to identify a functional site in the genome.\n\n== Combined approaches ==\nPrograms such as [http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html Maker] combine extrinsic and ''ab initio'' approaches by mapping protein and [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] data to the genome to validate ''ab initio'' predictions. [http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/ Augustus], which may be used as part of the Maker pipeline, can also incorporate hints in the form of EST alignments or protein profiles to increase the accuracy of the gene prediction.\n\n== Comparative genomics approaches ==\nAs the entire genomes of many different species are sequenced, a promising direction in current research on gene finding is a [[comparative genomics]] approach.\n\nThis is based on the principle that the forces of [[natural selection]] cause genes and other functional elements to undergo mutation at a slower rate than the rest of the genome, since mutations in functional elements are more likely to negatively impact the organism than mutations elsewhere.  Genes can thus be detected by comparing the genomes of related species to detect this evolutionary pressure for conservation. This approach was first applied to the mouse and human genomes, using programs such as SLAM, SGP and TWINSCAN/N-SCAN and CONTRAST.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross SS, Do CB, Sirota M, Batzoglou S | title = CONTRAST: a discriminative, phylogeny-free approach to multiple informant de novo gene prediction | language = En | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = R269 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18096039 | pmc = 2246271 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-12-r269 }}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple informants ===\n\nTWINSCAN examined only human-mouse synteny to look for orthologous genes. Programs such as N-SCAN and CONTRAST allowed the incorporation of alignments from multiple organisms, or in the case of N-SCAN, a single alternate organism from the target. The use of multiple informants can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCONTRAST is composed of two elements. The first is a smaller classifier, identifying donor splice sites and acceptor splice sites as well as start and stop codons. The second element involves constructing a full model using machine learning. Breaking the problem into two means that smaller targeted data sets can be used to train the classifiers,\nand that classifier can operate independently and be trained with smaller windows. The full model can use the independent classifier, and not have to waste computational time or model complexity re-classifying intron-exon boundaries. The paper in which CONTRAST is introduced proposes that their method (and those of TWINSCAN, etc.) be classified as ''de novo'' gene assembly, using alternate genomes, and identifying it as distinct from ''ab initio'', which uses a target 'informant' genomes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nComparative gene finding can also be used to project high quality annotations from one genome to another. Notable examples include Projector, GeneWise, GeneMapper and GeMoMa. Such techniques now play a central role in the annotation of all genomes.\n\n== Pseudogene prediction ==\n\n[[Pseudogenes]] are close relatives of genes, sharing very high sequence homology, but being unable to code for the same [[protein]] product.

Given an mRNA sequence, it is trivial to derive a unique genomic DNA sequence from which it had to have been [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Given a protein sequence, a  family of possible coding DNA sequences can be derived by reverse translation of the [[genetic code]]. Once candidate DNA sequences have been determined, it is a relatively straightforward algorithmic problem to efficiently search a target genome for matches, complete or partial, and exact or inexact. Given a sequence, local alignment algorithms such as [[BLAST]], [[FASTA]] and [[Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm|Smith-Waterman]] look for regions of similarity between the target sequence and possible candidate matches. Matches can be complete or partial, and exact or inexact. The success of this approach is limited by the contents and accuracy of the sequence database.\n\nA high degree of similarity to a known messenger RNA or protein product is strong evidence that a region of a target genome is a protein-coding gene. However, to apply this approach systemically requires extensive sequencing of mRNA and protein products. Not only is this expensive, but in complex organisms, only a subset of all genes in the organism's genome are expressed at any given time, meaning that extrinsic evidence for many genes is not readily accessible in any single cell culture. Thus, to collect extrinsic evidence for most or all of the genes in a complex organism requires the study of many hundreds or thousands of [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|cell types]], which presents further difficulties. For example, some human genes may be expressed only during development as an embryo or fetus, which might be difficult to study for ethical reasons.\n\nDespite these difficulties, extensive transcript and protein sequence databases have been generated for human as well as other important model organisms in biology, such as mice and yeast. For example, the [[RefSeq]] database contains transcript and protein sequence from many different species, and the [[Ensembl]] system comprehensively maps this evidence to human and several other genomes. It is, however, likely that these databases are both incomplete and contain small but significant amounts of erroneous data.\n\nNew high-throughput [[transcriptome]] sequencing technologies such as [[RNA-Seq]] and [[ChIP-sequencing]] open opportunities for incorporating additional extrinsic evidence into gene prediction and validation, and allow structurally rich and more accurate alternative to previous methods of measuring [[gene expression]] such as [[expressed sequence tag]] or [[DNA microarray]].\n\nMajor challenges involved in gene prediction involve dealing with sequencing errors in raw DNA data, dependence on the quality of the [[sequence assembly]], handling short reads, [[frameshift mutation]]s, [[overlapping gene]]s and incomplete genes.\n\nIn prokaryotes it's essential to consider [[horizontal gene transfer]] when searching for gene sequence homology. An additional important factor underused in current gene detection tools is existence of gene clusters\u2014[[operon]]s( is a functioning unit of [[DNA]] containing a cluster of [[gene]]s under the control of a single [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]]) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most popular gene detectors treat each gene in isolation, independent of others, which is not biologically accurate.\n\n== ''Ab initio'' methods ==\nAb Initio gene prediction is an intrinsic method based on gene content and signal detection. Because of the inherent expense and difficulty in obtaining extrinsic evidence for many genes, it is also necessary to resort to ''[[ab initio]]'' gene finding, in which the [[genomic]] [[DNA sequence]] alone is systematically searched for certain tell-tale signs of protein-coding genes. These signs can be broadly categorized as either ''signals'', specific sequences that indicate the presence of a gene nearby, or ''content'', statistical properties of the protein-coding sequence itself. ''Ab initio'' gene finding might be more accurately characterized as gene ''prediction'', since extrinsic evidence is generally required to conclusively establish that a putative gene is functional.\n[[File:Gene Prediction.png|thumb|This picture shows how Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can be used for gene prediction. Gene prediction is the process of determining where a coding gene might be in a genomic sequence. Functional proteins must begin with a Start codon (where DNA transcription begins), and end with a Stop codon (where transcription ends). By looking at where those codons might fall in a DNA sequence, one can see where a functional protein might be located. This is important in gene prediction because it can reveal where coding genes are in an entire genomic sequence. In this example, a functional protein can be discovered using ORF3 because it begins with a Start codon, has multiple amino acids, and then ends with a Stop codon, all within the same reading frame.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms|last=Madigan|first=Michael T.|last2=Martinko|first2=John M.|last3=Bender|first3=Kelly S.|last4=Buckley|first4=Daniel H.|last5=Stahl|first5=David | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Pearson|year=2015|isbn=9780321897398|edition=14th|location=Boston }}</ref>]]\nIn the genomes of [[prokaryotes]], genes have specific and relatively well-understood [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequences (signals), such as the [[Pribnow box]] and [[transcription factor]] [[binding site]]s, which are easy to systematically identify. Also, the sequence coding for a protein occurs as one contiguous [[open reading frame]] (ORF), which is typically many hundred or thousands of [[base pair]]s long. The statistics of [[stop codon]]s are such that even finding an open reading frame of this length is a fairly informative sign. (Since 3 of the 64 possible codons in the genetic code are stop codons, one would expect a stop codon approximately every 20\u201325 codons, or 60\u201375 base pairs, in a [[random sequence]].) Furthermore, protein-coding DNA has certain [[Frequency|periodicities]] and other statistical properties that are easy to detect in sequence of this length. These characteristics make prokaryotic gene finding relatively straightforward, and well-designed systems are able to achieve high levels of accuracy.\n\n''Ab initio'' gene finding in [[eukaryotes]], especially complex organisms like humans, is considerably more challenging for several reasons. First, the promoter and other regulatory signals in these genomes are more complex and less well-understood than in prokaryotes, making them more difficult to reliably recognize. Two classic examples of signals identified by eukaryotic gene finders are [[CpG island]]s and binding sites for a [[Polyadenylation|poly(A) tail]].\n\nSecond, [[RNA splicing|splicing]] mechanisms employed by eukaryotic cells mean that a particular protein-coding sequence in the genome is divided into several parts ([[exons]]), separated by non-coding sequences ([[introns]]). (Splice sites are themselves another signal that eukaryotic gene finders are often designed to identify.) A typical protein-coding gene in humans might be divided into a dozen exons, each less than two hundred base pairs in length, and some as short as twenty to thirty. It is therefore much more difficult to detect periodicities and other known content properties of protein-coding DNA in eukaryotes.\n\nAdvanced gene finders for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes typically use complex [[probabilistic model]]s, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs) to combine information from a variety of different signal and content measurements. The [[GLIMMER]] system is a widely used and highly accurate gene finder for prokaryotes. [[GeneMark]] is another popular approach. Eukaryotic ''ab initio'' gene finders, by comparison, have achieved only limited success; notable examples are the [[GENSCAN]] and [[geneid]] programs. The SNAP gene finder is HMM-based like Genscan, and attempts to be more adaptable to different organisms, addressing problems related to using a gene finder on a genome sequence that it was not trained against.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Korf I | title = Gene finding in novel genomes | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 5 | pages = 59 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15144565 | pmc = 421630 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-5-59 }}</ref> A few recent approaches like mSplicer,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = R\u00e4tsch G, Sonnenburg S, Srinivasan J, Witte H, M\u00fcller KR, Sommer RJ, Sch\u00f6lkopf B | title = Improving the Caenorhabditis elegans genome annotation using machine learning | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = e20 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17319737 | pmc = 1808025 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030020 }}</ref> CONTRAST,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross SS, Do CB, Sirota M, Batzoglou S | title = CONTRAST: a discriminative, phylogeny-free approach to multiple informant de novo gene prediction | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = R269 | date = 2007-12-20 | pmid = 18096039 | pmc = 2246271 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-12-r269 }}</ref> or [[mGene]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schweikert G, Behr J, Zien A, Zeller G, Ong CS, Sonnenburg S, R\u00e4tsch G | title = mGene.web: a web service for accurate computational gene finding | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W312\u20136 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19494180 | pmc = 2703990 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp479 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19494180 }}</ref> also use [[machine learning]] techniques like [[support vector machines]] for successful gene prediction.

The output at each position is a score based on whether the network thinks the window contains a donor splice site or an acceptor splice site. Larger windows offer more accuracy but also require more computational power. A neural network is an example of a signal sensor as its goal is to identify a functional site in the genome.\n\n== Combined approaches ==\nPrograms such as [http://www.yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html Maker] combine extrinsic and ''ab initio'' approaches by mapping protein and [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] data to the genome to validate ''ab initio'' predictions. [http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/ Augustus], which may be used as part of the Maker pipeline, can also incorporate hints in the form of EST alignments or protein profiles to increase the accuracy of the gene prediction.\n\n== Comparative genomics approaches ==\nAs the entire genomes of many different species are sequenced, a promising direction in current research on gene finding is a [[comparative genomics]] approach.\n\nThis is based on the principle that the forces of [[natural selection]] cause genes and other functional elements to undergo mutation at a slower rate than the rest of the genome, since mutations in functional elements are more likely to negatively impact the organism than mutations elsewhere.  Genes can thus be detected by comparing the genomes of related species to detect this evolutionary pressure for conservation. This approach was first applied to the mouse and human genomes, using programs such as SLAM, SGP and TWINSCAN/N-SCAN and CONTRAST.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gross SS, Do CB, Sirota M, Batzoglou S | title = CONTRAST: a discriminative, phylogeny-free approach to multiple informant de novo gene prediction | language = En | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = R269 | date = 2007 | pmid = 18096039 | pmc = 2246271 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-12-r269 }}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple informants ===\n\nTWINSCAN examined only human-mouse synteny to look for orthologous genes. Programs such as N-SCAN and CONTRAST allowed the incorporation of alignments from multiple organisms, or in the case of N-SCAN, a single alternate organism from the target. The use of multiple informants can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCONTRAST is composed of two elements. The first is a smaller classifier, identifying donor splice sites and acceptor splice sites as well as start and stop codons. The second element involves constructing a full model using machine learning. Breaking the problem into two means that smaller targeted data sets can be used to train the classifiers,\nand that classifier can operate independently and be trained with smaller windows. The full model can use the independent classifier, and not have to waste computational time or model complexity re-classifying intron-exon boundaries. The paper in which CONTRAST is introduced proposes that their method (and those of TWINSCAN, etc.) be classified as ''de novo'' gene assembly, using alternate genomes, and identifying it as distinct from ''ab initio'', which uses a target 'informant' genomes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nComparative gene finding can also be used to project high quality annotations from one genome to another. Notable examples include Projector, GeneWise, GeneMapper and GeMoMa. Such techniques now play a central role in the annotation of all genomes.\n\n== Pseudogene prediction ==\n\n[[Pseudogenes]] are close relatives of genes, sharing very high sequence homology, but being unable to code for the same [[protein]] product.

Both capsules are buried {{convert|50|ft}} below [[Flushing Meadows Park]], site of the Fair. Both the 1939 and 1965 [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]] are meant to be opened in [[7th millennium|6939]]. More recently, in 1985, Westinghouse created a smaller, [[Plexiglas]] shell to be buried beneath the [[New York Marriott Marquis]] hotel, in the heart of New York's theater district. However, this time capsule was never put in place.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThere is documentation of at least three physical time capsules at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as well as a \"virtual\" or digital time capsule.<ref name=\"BostonTC\"/>\n\n{{asof|2019}}, four time capsules are \"buried\" in space.

Historians suggest that items which describe the daily lives of the people who created them, such as personal notes, pictures, and documents, would greatly increase the value of the time capsule to future historians.\n\nIf time capsules have a [[museum]]-like goal of preserving the culture of a particular time and place for study, they fulfill this goal very poorly in that they, by definition, are kept sealed for a particular length of time. Subsequent generations between the launch date and the target date will have no direct access to the artifacts and therefore these generations are prevented from learning from the contents directly. Therefore, time capsules can be seen, in respect to their usefulness to historians, as dormant museums, their releases timed for some date so far in the future that the building in question is no longer intact.<ref name=jarvis />\n\nHistorians also concede that there are many [[historic preservation|preservation]] issues surrounding the selection of the [[Media (communication)|media]] to transmit this information to the future.<ref name=jarvis /> Some of these issues include the obsolescence of technology and the deterioration of electronic and magnetic storage media (known as the [[digital dark age]]), and possible language problems if the capsule is dug up in the distant future. Many buried time capsules are lost, as interest in them fades and the exact location is forgotten, or they are destroyed within a few years by [[groundwater]].\n\n[[Archives]] and archival materials, including videos, might be the best types of time capsules, as long as the medium can still be used, or the data can be read by the latest technologies and software.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe 1947 docudrama ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' is a semi-historical account of the creation of the first atomic bomb during [[World War II]].  The film begins with staged newsreel footage of the scientists and officers involved in the project (played by actors) burying a time capsule in [[Redwood National Forest]] in [[California]].  The capsule contained a copy of the film, along with a projector to view it on, and instructions for its operation set on a metal sheet. The purpose of the capsule was in line with the film's title, about whether humanity will destroy itself now that it has the ability to, or whether it will rise above war as a whole and come together to use nuclear power for greater purposes.  The film can be seen as an example of [[Cold War]] [[propaganda]].<ref name=\"Inc1947\">{{cite magazine|title=The Beginning or The End|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60kEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=the+beginning+or+the+end+time+capsule|date=March 17, 1947|publisher=LIFE|pages=75\u2013|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 dramatic film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' involves a time capsule being placed in the ground by an elementary school in 1959. After staring into the sun, a girl begins to hear voices and later begins to frantically write an incoherent set of numbers down onto a page that she is supposed to be writing a letter to a student in the future with. The capsule is sealed and opened in 2009 where the character John Koestler realizes that the list of numbers correlates to the dates and death tolls of major disasters, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]], and other events resulting in mass death which occurred after the time capsule was buried, after his son Caleb Koestler receives the letter and brings it home.\n\nArtists such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Christian Boltanski]], and [[Louise Bourgeois]] are known for compiling collections of everyday artifacts that they associate with memories of the past, which are preserved in museums and archives.<ref name=\"Bliss\">{{cite web |last1=Bliss |first1=Louise |title=Containers of remembering: the creative practices of collecting memory objects |url=https://www.academia.edu/6602915/Containers_of_remembering_the_creative_practices_of_collecting_memory_objects |website=Academia.edu |accessdate=2019-05-02 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal and domestic time capsules==\nCommercially-manufactured sealable containers are sold for protection of personal time capsules; some of the more durable waterproof containers used for [[geocaching]] may also be suitable.

It contained everyday items such as a spool of thread and doll, a book of record<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://archive.org/details/timecapsulecups00westrich |title=The book of record of the time capsule of cupaloy, deemed capable of resisting the effects of time for five thousand years, preserving an account of universal achievements, embedded in the grounds of the New York World's fair, 1939 |last1=[Westinghouse electric corporation] |last2=Frederic W.

[[Microfilm]] spools condensed the contents of a [[Sears Roebuck]] catalog, dictionary, almanac, and other texts.\n\nThe 1939 time capsule was followed in 1965 by a second capsule at the same site, but {{convert|10|ft}} to the north of the original. Both capsules are buried {{convert|50|ft}} below [[Flushing Meadows Park]], site of the Fair. Both the 1939 and 1965 [[Westinghouse Time Capsules]] are meant to be opened in [[7th millennium|6939]]. More recently, in 1985, Westinghouse created a smaller, [[Plexiglas]] shell to be buried beneath the [[New York Marriott Marquis]] hotel, in the heart of New York's theater district. However, this time capsule was never put in place.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThere is documentation of at least three physical time capsules at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as well as a \"virtual\" or digital time capsule.<ref name=\"BostonTC\"/>\n\n{{asof|2019}}, four time capsules are \"buried\" in space. The two [[Pioneer Plaque]]s and the two [[Voyager Golden Record]]s have been attached to spacecraft for the possible benefit of spacefarers in the distant future. A fifth time capsule, the [[KEO]] satellite, was scheduled to be launched in 2015\u201316.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keo.org/Alerte.html |title=Les dates de KEO |access-date=December 7, 2014}}</ref> However, it has been delayed several times and an actual launch date has not been given. After launch, it will carry individual messages from Earth's inhabitants addressed to earthlings around the year 52,000, when it is due to return to Earth. {{asof|2019|07}}, the satellite had not been launched.\n\nThe [[International Time Capsule Society]] was created in 1990 to maintain a global database of all known time capsules.\n\n==Criticism==\nAccording to time capsule historian William Jarvis, most intentional time capsules usually do not provide much useful historical information: they are typically filled with \"useless junk\", new and pristine in condition, that tells little about the people of the time.<ref name=jarvis>William Jarvis (2002)</ref> Many time capsules today contain only [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] of limited value to future historians. Historians suggest that items which describe the daily lives of the people who created them, such as personal notes, pictures, and documents, would greatly increase the value of the time capsule to future historians.\n\nIf time capsules have a [[museum]]-like goal of preserving the culture of a particular time and place for study, they fulfill this goal very poorly in that they, by definition, are kept sealed for a particular length of time. Subsequent generations between the launch date and the target date will have no direct access to the artifacts and therefore these generations are prevented from learning from the contents directly. Therefore, time capsules can be seen, in respect to their usefulness to historians, as dormant museums, their releases timed for some date so far in the future that the building in question is no longer intact.<ref name=jarvis />\n\nHistorians also concede that there are many [[historic preservation|preservation]] issues surrounding the selection of the [[Media (communication)|media]] to transmit this information to the future.<ref name=jarvis /> Some of these issues include the obsolescence of technology and the deterioration of electronic and magnetic storage media (known as the [[digital dark age]]), and possible language problems if the capsule is dug up in the distant future. Many buried time capsules are lost, as interest in them fades and the exact location is forgotten, or they are destroyed within a few years by [[groundwater]].\n\n[[Archives]] and archival materials, including videos, might be the best types of time capsules, as long as the medium can still be used, or the data can be read by the latest technologies and software.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe 1947 docudrama ''[[The Beginning or the End]]'' is a semi-historical account of the creation of the first atomic bomb during [[World War II]].  The film begins with staged newsreel footage of the scientists and officers involved in the project (played by actors) burying a time capsule in [[Redwood National Forest]] in [[California]].  The capsule contained a copy of the film, along with a projector to view it on, and instructions for its operation set on a metal sheet. The purpose of the capsule was in line with the film's title, about whether humanity will destroy itself now that it has the ability to, or whether it will rise above war as a whole and come together to use nuclear power for greater purposes.  The film can be seen as an example of [[Cold War]] [[propaganda]].<ref name=\"Inc1947\">{{cite magazine|title=The Beginning or The End|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60kEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=the+beginning+or+the+end+time+capsule|date=March 17, 1947|publisher=LIFE|pages=75\u2013|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 dramatic film ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' involves a time capsule being placed in the ground by an elementary school in 1959. After staring into the sun, a girl begins to hear voices and later begins to frantically write an incoherent set of numbers down onto a page that she is supposed to be writing a letter to a student in the future with. The capsule is sealed and opened in 2009 where the character John Koestler realizes that the list of numbers correlates to the dates and death tolls of major disasters, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]], and other events resulting in mass death which occurred after the time capsule was buried, after his son Caleb Koestler receives the letter and brings it home.\n\nArtists such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[Christian Boltanski]], and [[Louise Bourgeois]] are known for compiling collections of everyday artifacts that they associate with memories of the past, which are preserved in museums and archives.<ref name=\"Bliss\">{{cite web |last1=Bliss |first1=Louise |title=Containers of remembering: the creative practices of collecting memory objects |url=https://www.academia.edu/6602915/Containers_of_remembering_the_creative_practices_of_collecting_memory_objects |website=Academia.edu |accessdate=2019-05-02 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal and domestic time capsules==\nCommercially-manufactured sealable containers are sold for protection of personal time capsules; some of the more durable waterproof containers used for [[geocaching]] may also be suitable.

He made his debut on 16 April 2014 in a 2-0 J.League Cup victory away to [[Sagan Tosu]].   He started the game and was replaced by [[Akihiro Sato (footballer, born October 1986)|Akihiro Sato]] after 71 minutes.<ref name=\"Sagan Tosu vs Gamba Osaka 16 April 2014\">{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/04/16/japan/j-league-cup/sagan-tosu/gamba-osaka/1642035/?ICID=PL_MS_03 | title=Sagan Tosu vs Gamba Osaka 16 April 2014 | work=Soccerway | accessdate=2 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe didn't play at all in 2015 or 2016 before finding himself in Gamba's starting line up towards the back end of the [[2017 Gamba Osaka season|2017 season]] where he played a total of 7 league matches and 2 [[AFC Champions League]] games without getting his name on the scoresheet.\n\nGamba changed head coaches ahead of the [[2018 Gamba Osaka season|2018 season]] with Brazilian [[Levir Culpi]] replacing the long serving [[Kenta Hasegawa]] and this saw a big reduction in Takagi's top team playing time as neither Culpi nor mid-season replacement [[Tsuneyasu Miyamoto]] could find space for Takagi in their starting line-ups and he was restricted to a mere 1 J.League Cup substitute appearance against [[Urawa Red Diamonds]].<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\"/><ref name=\"Akito Takagi Gamba Osaka Player Profile\"/>\n\nIn 2016 Gamba's Under-23 side joined J3 League along with the reserve teams of [[FC Tokyo]] and [[Cerezo Osaka]].   Takagi featured for them often in their inaugural campaign, netting once in 23 appearances as they finished 9th in the overall standings.   The team was run more as a youth team in 2017 and owing to this as well as his involvement with Gamba's first team, he only played once throughout the year.   However in 2018 it was back to being a reserve team again and Takagi put in a stronger showing, playing all 32 games and bagging 5 goals as his team finished 6th in the final league table.<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\"/><ref name=\"Akito Takagi Gamba Osaka Player Profile\"/>\n\n==National team career==\n\nIn May 2017, Takagi was elected [[Japan national under-20 football team|Japan U-20 national team]] for [[2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2017 U-20 World Cup]]. At this tournament, he played 2 matches.<ref>https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=371892/index.html</ref>\n\n==Club statistics==\n\nLast update: ''2 December 2018''<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Other\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!

He currently plays for [[Montedio Yamagata]] on loan from [[Gamba Osaka]] in the [[J1 League]] as well as their reserve team, [[Gamba Osaka U-23]] in [[J3 League]].   His playing position is either [[attacking midfielder]] or [[First forward|forward]].<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\">{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/akito-takagi/336719/ | title=Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics | work=Soccerway.com | accessdate=17 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Akito Takagi Gamba Osaka Player Profile\">{{cite web | url=http://www2.gamba-osaka.net/club/player2019_18.html | title=Akito Takagi Gamba Osaka Player Profile | work=Gamba Osaka | accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n\nBorn and raised in Osaka, Takagi came through the youth ranks at Gamba Osaka and joined the senior squad for the first time in [[2014 Gamba Osaka season|2014]] at the age of 17.   He made his debut on 16 April 2014 in a 2-0 J.League Cup victory away to [[Sagan Tosu]].   He started the game and was replaced by [[Akihiro Sato (footballer, born October 1986)|Akihiro Sato]] after 71 minutes.<ref name=\"Sagan Tosu vs Gamba Osaka 16 April 2014\">{{cite web | url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/04/16/japan/j-league-cup/sagan-tosu/gamba-osaka/1642035/?ICID=PL_MS_03 | title=Sagan Tosu vs Gamba Osaka 16 April 2014 | work=Soccerway | accessdate=2 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe didn't play at all in 2015 or 2016 before finding himself in Gamba's starting line up towards the back end of the [[2017 Gamba Osaka season|2017 season]] where he played a total of 7 league matches and 2 [[AFC Champions League]] games without getting his name on the scoresheet.\n\nGamba changed head coaches ahead of the [[2018 Gamba Osaka season|2018 season]] with Brazilian [[Levir Culpi]] replacing the long serving [[Kenta Hasegawa]] and this saw a big reduction in Takagi's top team playing time as neither Culpi nor mid-season replacement [[Tsuneyasu Miyamoto]] could find space for Takagi in their starting line-ups and he was restricted to a mere 1 J.League Cup substitute appearance against [[Urawa Red Diamonds]].<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\"/><ref name=\"Akito Takagi Gamba Osaka Player Profile\"/>\n\nIn 2016 Gamba's Under-23 side joined J3 League along with the reserve teams of [[FC Tokyo]] and [[Cerezo Osaka]].   Takagi featured for them often in their inaugural campaign, netting once in 23 appearances as they finished 9th in the overall standings.   The team was run more as a youth team in 2017 and owing to this as well as his involvement with Gamba's first team, he only played once throughout the year.   However in 2018 it was back to being a reserve team again and Takagi put in a stronger showing, playing all 32 games and bagging 5 goals as his team finished 6th in the final league table.<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\"/><ref name=\"Akito Takagi Gamba Osaka Player Profile\"/>\n\n==National team career==\n\nIn May 2017, Takagi was elected [[Japan national under-20 football team|Japan U-20 national team]] for [[2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup|2017 U-20 World Cup]]. At this tournament, he played 2 matches.<ref>https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=371892/index.html</ref>\n\n==Club statistics==\n\nLast update: ''2 December 2018''<ref name=\"Akito Takagi Soccerway Player Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Other\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!
