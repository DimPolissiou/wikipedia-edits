{"title_page": "Edison Awards", "text_new": "{{For|the Dutch award given for musical achievement|Edison Award}}\n{{advert|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox award\n| name = Edison Awards\n| current_awards =\n| image = Edison_Awards_Logo.jpg\n| imagesize =\n| caption = \n| description = Honoring excellence in new product and service development, marketing, human-centered design and innovation.\n| presenter = \n| country = [[United States]]\n| location =\n| year = 1987\n| year2 =\n| website = http://www.edisonawards.com/\n}}\n\n'''The Edison Awards''' are a set of trade-specific business-insider awards with frequently changing categories given for product innovation and evaluated primarily from the perspective of financial viability and market success.  According to the organization that issues them, they honor excellence in technological innovation, new product and service development, marketing, and human-centered design. The organization behind the awards calls them \"The Oscars of Innovation.\" The critics of the awards have pointed out that the awards are not given for academic or knowledge innovation or discovery, rather, are sector-specific awards given within specific areas representing innovation or development of consumer products by primarily large mainstream commercial companies that create products or innovate in the sectors that sell to consumers in commercial markets, and the recipients of the awards widely advertise the designation in efforts to sell to consumers or present their product as superior.  \n\nThe awards are given annually by Edison Universe, which says that it is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to fostering innovators.  Its awards are given to products and companies, not individual innovators, and are decided on by business executives who belong to the voting pool of the organization by invite.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Edison Awards Honor Innovation in Technology|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sebastian-howard/edison-awards-innovation_b_846402.html|website = Huffington Post|accessdate = 2018-04-13}}</ref> The Awards are named after businessman [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (1847-1931) and the organization says that they \"symbolize the persistence and excellence in innovation personified by Edison.\"   \n\nThe organization's methodology is said to be based on four criteria: \"Concept, Value, Delivery and Impact.\"  Additionally, Edison Green Awards and Edison Achievement Awards are bestowed each year. Originally established in 1987 by the [[American Marketing Association]], as a way of increasing the profile and marketing companies behind the association, the Edison Awards ultimately had a deceptive start, intending to use the designation primarily to sell more products.  In 2008, it says it became a non-profit. Since the organization's award system does not limit the applicants by category or threshold of achievement, the awards are given to recipients on the basis of subjective evaluation of their alleged innovation, and in broad categories, each recipient company or product explaining how it was innovative, but not why it is the award winner in a category when compared to competitors.  Categories are vague and have grown at various times, currently including broad and unclear categories such as \"Next Gen Computing,\" \"Clean Manufacturing,\" and \"Technology Market Solutions.\"   \n\n==The Edison Award==\nAnnually, beginning in September, nominations are sought from companies in fifteen categories, making this a largely self-promoted and nominated process. A nomination fee of ~$1000 is required, and then nominations are vetted by members of the Edison Award Steering Committee, who are chosen from among industry insiders who present a slate of finalists to the Panel of Judges. The panel is composed of over 3,000 senior business executives and \"academics\" from across the nation, who vote for the finalists.  How the \"senior business executives\" are chosen, or why business executives should be deciding on matters of scientific discovery is unclear.  \n\nAwards are presented at an annual black-tie gala event, usually held each April. Past gala events have been held in New York, NY, Chicago, IL, and San Francisco, CA. Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards are given in each category.<ref>Sonali Basak, [http://techli.com/2013/04/edison-awards-highlight-innovation-across-american-industry-titans/ \"Edison awards highlight innovation across American industry titans\"], ''Techli.com'', April 26, 2013</ref>\n\nThe \"Panel of Judges\" includes \"BPI Network,\" said to be \"A peer-powered network of innovation executives dedicated to sharing emerging trends and transformational ideas.\"  While it advertises its \"Steering Committee\" members, the selection process also includes \"ad hoc professionals\" whose role is unclear and appointments not specified.  The organization solicits sponsors and makes them partners according to the level of their contribution.  It further advertises the value of the awards to the profits of the companies selected, making this a highly dubious process in design, purpose, methodology and controls, and an organization that evaluates best-practices while seemingly operating within processes with high corruption incentivization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisonawards.com/criteria.php|title=Edison Awards\u2122 - Honoring the Best in Innovation and Innovators|website=www.edisonawards.com|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref> \n\n==Edison Universe Scholarships==\nA percentage of every Edison Awards nomination and gala event goes to fund '''Edison Universe Scholarships''', a non-profit program focused on fostering innovation of youth by promoting innovation concepts through curriculum and educational programs.

Since its inauguration, the Varsity match had been contested every year apart from 1885, while over the period the format of the competition had varied considerably.  \n\n<br />\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:axford-hc.jpg|thumb|right|OUCC rider Danny Axford on his way to a 4th BUSA Hillclimb victory, at Curbar Gap, Derbyshire]]\nIn early 1939, several British regional newspapers announced, via a syndicated article, that: \u201cAfter an interval of 37 years organised cycling has been revived at Oxford University. An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\".<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'', Tuesday, 31 January 1939, p. 12.</ref> it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29th January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. \n\nIn the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) and the mandatory Senior Member was J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]].<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trialing, he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member and otherwise Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow, Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.) Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Club achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire. Since then, OUCC has been highly successful in competition, particularly in inter-university championships, gaining [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]] / BSSF titles in every type of road racing event; notable winning years being 1990 (Jonathan Atkinson: individual Hill-Climb), 1991 (S.

In Lent Term, 1882, the membership of the club stood at 44.<ref>''Rules, Bye-Laws, Report and List of Members'', Oxford: Oxford University Bicycle Club, 1882.</ref> The club continued as O.U.Bi.C. until it fell dormant in 1902.  Since its inauguration, the Varsity match had been contested every year apart from 1885, while over the period the format of the competition had varied considerably.  \n\n<br />\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:axford-hc.jpg|thumb|right|OUCC rider Danny Axford on his way to a 4th BUSA Hillclimb victory, at Curbar Gap, Derbyshire]]\nIn early 1939, several British regional newspapers announced, via a syndicated article, that: \u201cAfter an interval of 37 years organised cycling has been revived at Oxford University. An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\".<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'', Tuesday, 31 January 1939, p. 12.</ref> it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29th January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. \n\nIn the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) and the mandatory Senior Member was J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]].<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trialing, he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member and otherwise Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow, Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.) Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Club achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire.
