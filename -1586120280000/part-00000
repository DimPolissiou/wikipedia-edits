Its operator is the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA), which is controlled by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) of New York.

After 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most lines for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies.  The first line of the city-owned and operated [[Independent Subway System]] (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down.  However, it was kept within the core of the city because of the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal [[New York City Board of Transportation|Board of Transportation]] by the state.<ref name=\"Hood, Clifton 2004\">{{cite book |title=722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York\n |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/722_Miles.html?id=0YfdjUgMAscC\n |author=Clifton Hood |isbn=978-0801880544 |year=2004 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}</ref> This required it to be run \"at cost\", necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/historyindependentsubway.html\n |title=History of the Independent Subway|date=2000\n |website=nycsubway.org|publisher=nycsubway.org|author=Mark S. Feinman|accessdate=July 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the city took over running the previously privately operated systems.  Some elevated lines closed immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but [[List of New York City Subway inter-division connections|several connections]] were built between the IND and BMT, which now operate as one division called the [[B Division (New York City Subway)|B Division]].  Since IRT infrastructure is [[Structure gauge|too small]] for B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the [[A Division (New York City Subway)|A Division]].\n\nThe NYCTA, a public authority presided over by New York City, was created in 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations from the city.<ref name=\"nyct facts\"/> The NYCTA was under control of the state-level MTA in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitmuseumeducation.org/trc/background |title=New York Transit Museum - Teacher Resource Center - History of Public Transportation in New York City |publisher=Transitmuseumeducation.org |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}</ref> Soon after the MTA took control of the subway, New York City entered a fiscal crisis. It closed many elevated subway lines that became too expensive to maintain. Graffiti and crime became common, and equipment and stations fell into decrepit condition. The New York City Subway tried to stay solvent, so it had to make many service cutbacks and defer necessary maintenance projects. In the 1980s an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway began.\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] resulted in [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks#NYC Subway|service disruptions]], particularly on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], which ran directly underneath the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].  Sections of the tunnel, as well as the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street station]], which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely damaged and had to be rebuilt, requiring suspension of service on that line south of Chambers Street.  Ten other nearby stations were temporarily closed.  By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line) reopened on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street.<ref name=\"tunnelvision\" /><ref name=\"brianabbott.net\">[http://brianabbott.net/observations/2004/09/11/september-11-three-years-later Brian Abbott.

At that time, [[New York County]] (Manhattan Island and part of the Bronx), Kings County (including the cities of Brooklyn and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]), and Queens County were separate municipal entities. Competing steam-powered elevated railroads were built over major avenues. The first elevated line was constructed in 1867-1870 by Charles Harvey and his [[West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway]] company along Greenwich Street and Ninth Avenue (although [[Cable car (railway)|cable cars]] were the initial mode of transportation on that railway). More lines were built on [[IRT Second Avenue Line|Second]], [[IRT Third Avenue Line|Third]] and [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth]] Avenues. None of these structures remain today, but these lines later shared trackage with subway trains as part of the IRT system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Transit in New York |publisher=NYCSubway.org |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Early_Rapid_Transit_In_New_York |accessdate=October 29, 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn Kings County, elevated railroads were built by several companies, over [[BMT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington]], [[BMT Myrtle Avenue Line|Myrtle]], [[BMT Third Avenue Line|Third]] and [[BMT Fifth Avenue Line|Fifth]] Avenues, [[BMT Fulton Street Line|Fulton Street]] and [[BMT Broadway (Brooklyn) Line|Broadway]]. These also later shared trackage with subway trains, and even operated into the subway, as part of the BRT and BMT. Most of these structures have been dismantled, but some have been rebuilt and upgraded. These lines were linked to Manhattan by various ferries and later the tracks along the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] (which originally had their own line and were later integrated into the BRT/BMT). Also in Kings County, six [[steam railroad|steam excursion railroads]] were built to various beaches in the southern part of the county; all but one (the Manhattan Beach Line) eventually fell under BMT control.<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Transit in Brooklyn |publisher=NYCSubway.org |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Early_Rapid_Transit_in_Brooklyn,_1878-1913 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Beach Pneumatic Transit===\n[[File:Beach Pneumatic Transit 01.jpg|thumb|right|Beach Pneumatic Transit]]\nThe [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] was the first attempt to build an underground [[public transit]] system in New York City. In 1869, [[Alfred Ely Beach]] and his Beach Pneumatic Transit Company of New York began constructing a pneumatic subway line beneath [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].

Passengers would simply ride out and back, to see what the proposed subway might be like.

The Triborough Plan comprised three new lines:\n* An IRT line from [[South Ferry\u2013Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry\u2013Whitehall Street]] in Manhattan, with the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] to [[Pelham Bay Park (IRT Pelham Line)|Pelham Bay Park]] and [[Woodlawn (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|Woodlawn]] in the Bronx\n* The BRT [[Nassau Street Loop]], later the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]]. The BRT's track went over the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]], and [[Williamsburg Bridge]]s; the Nassau Street Line was to connect to the Brooklyn Bridge, but never did. The connections to the other two bridges were built; the Manhattan Bridge connection was cut in 1967 with the building of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]].\n* A BRT subway under [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]] in Brooklyn, leading to [[Bay Ridge\u201395th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Bay Ridge]] and [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island]]. This corresponded to today's [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] and the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]].\n\nThe BRT lines were built to wider profiles because the BRT did not want to use IRT trackage, which was narrower by comparison and carried far fewer passengers per hour.  The design was inspired by the cars built for the [[Red Line (MBTA)#Rolling stock|Cambridge Subway (Red Line)]] which were designed based on the results of studies done on how best to design and operate a subway car that could carry the most passengers the most efficiently. The [[rolling stock]], however, had to be the same [[track gauge]] so the trains could interoperate under the Dual Contracts. The Fourth Avenue and Sea Beach Lines were opened on June 19, 1915, after years of delays for building of these lines and the Nassau Street Line. The first BRT section, however, had opened on September 16, 1908, from [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] across the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], but using narrow-width cars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/09/17/105012048.pdf|title=MAYOR RUNS A TRAIN OVER NEW BRIDGE|last=|first=|date=September 17, 1908|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|page=16|access-date=October 30, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nUntil the completion of the Fourth Avenue Line, there was a tram across the Manhattan Bridge which did not connect to any other trackage in the New York City Subway. The track was called \"[[Manhattan Bridge Three Cent Line]]\" because the fare was three cents. Along with the [[Brooklyn and North River Railroad]], the two streetcar companies began operations on those tracks. When trackage was connected to the bridge in 1915, the trolleys were moved to the upper level roadways until 1929, when service was discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/BMT_4th_Avenue_Line|title=BMT 4th Avenue Line|last=Feinman|first=Mark|last2=Darlington|first2=Peggy|date=2012|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=October 30, 2016|last3=Pirmann|first3=David|last4=Brennan|first4=Joseph}}</ref>\n\n====Dual Contracts====\n{{main|Dual Contracts}}\n\nThe BRT, which just barely entered Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge, wanted the opportunity to compete with the IRT, and the IRT wanted to extend its Brooklyn line to compete with the BRT. This led to the city's agreement to contract for future subways with both the BRT and IRT.\n\nThe expansion of rapid transit was greatly facilitated by the signing of the Dual Contracts on March 19, 1913. ''Contract 3'' was signed between the IRT and the city; the contract between the BRT and the city was ''Contract 4''. The majority of the present-day subway system was either built or improved under these contracts.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org dualsystem\"/> The [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]] and [[IRT Flushing Line|Flushing Line]] were built at this time and were for some time operated by both companies. Under the terms of Contracts 3 and 4, the city would build new subway and elevated lines, rehabilitate and expand certain existing elevated lines, and lease them to the private companies for operation. The cost would be borne more-or-less equally by the city and the companies. The city's contribution was in cash raised by bond offerings, while the companies' contributions were variously by supplying cash, facilities, and equipment to run the lines.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org dualsystem\"/>\n\n[[File:Queensboro Plaza.png|thumb|left|250px|The track layout of [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]] was complex because the Contracts necessitated two different types of [[rolling stock]] and two different [[fare control]] areas.]]\n\nAs part of the contracts, the two companies were to share lines in Queens: a short line to [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] called the [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]]; and a longer line reaching initially to [[Corona, Queens|Corona]], and eventually to [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], called the [[IRT Flushing Line|Corona Line]]. The lines operated jointly and began from [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]]. The IRT accessed the station both from the 1907 [[Steinway Tunnel]] and an extension of the [[IRT Second Avenue Line|Second Avenue Elevated]] from Manhattan over the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. The BRT fed the Queens lines from a new tunnel from the [[60th Street Tunnel]] to Manhattan. Technically the line was under IRT ownership, but the BRT/BMT was granted [[trackage rights]] in perpetuity, essentially making it theirs also.<ref name=\"diehl\"/><ref name=\"derrick\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Derrick |title=Tunneling to the Future: The Story of the Great Subway Expansion that Saved New York |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0814719107}}</ref> However, both lines were built to IRT specifications. This meant that IRT passengers had a one-seat ride to Manhattan destinations, whereas BRT passengers had to make a change at Queensborough Plaza. This came to be important when service was extended for the [[1939 World's Fair]], as the IRT was able to offer direct express trains from Manhattan, and the BRT was not. This practice lasted well into the municipal ownership of the lines and was not ended until 1949.<ref name=\"diehl\"/><ref name=\"derrick\"/>\n\nSeveral provisions were imposed on the companies: the fare was limited to five cents, and this led to financial troubles for the two companies after post-[[World War I]] inflation; the city had the right to \"recapture\" any of the lines it built and run them as its own; and the city was to share in the profits. This eventually led to their downfall and consolidation into city ownership in 1940.<ref name=\"diehl\"/><ref name=\"derrick\"/>\n\nAs part of the Dual Contracts, the operations of the original IRT system changed drastically. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turn onto 42nd Street, and finally turn onto Park Avenue, there were two trunk lines connected by the [[42nd Street Shuttle]]. The system was changed from a \"Z\" system to an \"H\" system. The first trunk line, the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington Avenue Line]] assumed the portion of the original IRT system south of Grand Central. The line was extended northward with a new station at Grand Central and turned onto Lexington Avenue, where the line remained as four tracks. The line had connections to the new IRT Pelham Line and IRT Jerome Avenue Line in the Bronx, in addition to a new connection to the IRT White Plains Road Line. The second trunk, the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line assumed the portion of the original IRT system north of Times Square, and it extended southward with a new station at Times Square, running down Seventh Avenue, Varick Street and West Broadway. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Lower West Side, and to neighborhoods such as [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Greenwich Village]]. South of Chambers Street, two branches were constructed. The first branch ran to the Battery via Greenwich Street, while the second branch turned eastward under Park Place and Beeckman Street and down William Street, running under the East River through a tunnel before running under Clark Street and Fulton Street until it reached a junction at Borough Hall with the existing Contract 2 IRT Brooklyn Line.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/03/10/118138743.pdf|title=THE SEVENTH AND LEXINGTON AVENUE SUBWAYS WILL REVIVE DORMANT SECTIONS; Change in Operation That Will Transform Original Four-Tracked Subway Into Two Four-Tracked Systems and Double Present Capacity of the Interborough.

They helped alleviate densely population areas and probably helped save lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas.

Hylan]] was a strong advocate of public operation of the subway. He was fired from the BRT after working as a [[Motorman (locomotive)|motorman]] for some time, and he wanted to avoid having to spend more money to recapture the IRT and BRT, so he tried to push the two operators out of business. To that end, Hylan had denied allocating money for the BRT by refusing to build new lines, refusing to raise fares (thereby putting the BRT in more debt), denied building permits so that some major building work lasted longer than planned, and even refused to build a new subway yard for the BRT. The [[Malbone Street Wreck]] in 1918 contributed to the losses incurred by the two companies, which led to the bankruptcy of the BRT in 1918. The BRT, however, was reorganized into the BMT. The IRT was almost bankrupt, but managed to complete the [[IRT Flushing Line|line to Flushing]] by 1928. So, Hylan drew up plans for a third subway network, which would be built and operated in contrast to the existing subway lines, which were privately operated.<ref name=\"diehl\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, New York City had grown to over five and a half million inhabitants and urgently needed new subway lines. The dual system could not keep pace with this ever-increasing ridership. So, a compromise solution was finally found that would allow Hylan's plans as well as the interests of private operators to be considered. However, the city's and Hylan's long-term goal was the unification and consolidation of the existing subway, with the city operating a unified subway system. The city, bolstered by political claims that the private companies were reaping profits at taxpayer expense, determined that it would build, equip and operate a new system itself, with private investment and without sharing the profits with private entities.  This led to the building of the ''Independent City-Owned Subway'' (ICOS), sometimes called the ''Independent Subway System'' (ISS), the ''Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad'', or simply ''The Eighth Avenue Subway'' after the location of its [[IND Eighth Avenue Line|premier Manhattan mainline]]. After the city acquired the BMT and IRT in 1940, the Independent lines were dubbed the ''[[Independent Subway System|IND]]'' to follow the three-letter [[initialism]]s of the other systems.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/>\n\nThe original IND system, consisting of the Eighth Avenue mainline and the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue]], [[IND Concourse Line|Concourse]], [[IND Culver Line|Culver]], and [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|Queens Boulevard]] branch lines, was entirely underground in the four boroughs that it served, with the exception of the [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]] and [[Fourth Avenue (IND Culver Line)|Fourth Avenue]] stations on the [[Culver Viaduct]] over the [[Gowanus Canal]] in [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/>\n\n====Lines====\nAs the first line neared completion, New York City offered it for private operation as a formality, knowing that no operator would meet its terms. Thus the city declared that it would operate it itself, formalizing a foregone conclusion. The first line opened without a formal ceremony. The trains began operating their regular schedules ahead of time, and all stations of the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line|Eighth Avenue Line]], from [[207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|207th Street]] in [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] to [[Hudson Terminal (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Hudson Terminal]] (now World Trade Center), opened simultaneously at one minute after midnight on September 10, 1932.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D13F7395513738DDDA90994D1405B828FF1D3|title=Gay Midnight Crowd Rides First Trains in New Subway|last=|first=|date=September 10, 1932|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=1|access-date=October 30, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1936, a second trunk line\u2014the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue Line]]\u2014opened from [[West Fourth Street \u2013 Washington Square (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|West Fourth Street]] (where it splits from the Eighth Avenue Line) to [[East Broadway (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|East Broadway]].<ref name=\"laguardia opens link\">{{cite news |title=LaGuardia Opens New Subway Link |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/01/02/archives/la-guardia-opens-new-subway-link-warmly-praises-delaney-as-he-puts.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 2, 1936 |page=1 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Two Subway Links Start Wednesday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/06/archives/two-subway-links-start-wednesday-city-will-begin-operating-fulton.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 1936 |page=23 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=New Subway Link Opened by Mayor |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D13FF385B1B7B93CBA9178FD85F428385F9 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 1936 |page=23 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> During construction, streetcar service along Sixth Avenue was terminated.

Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. The [[Great Depression]] resulted in soaring costs, and the expansion became unmanageable, so it was not built along with the other three IND trunk lines. Construction on the first phase of the IND was already behind schedule, and the city and state were no longer able to provide funding. A scaled-down proposal including a turnoff at 34th Street and a connection crosstown was postponed in 1931.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/> Further revision of the plan and more studies followed. By 1939, construction had been postponed indefinitely, and Second Avenue was relegated to \"proposed\" status.

Though most of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the [[Second Avenue Subway]]. Plans for new lines date back to the early 1910s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/A_New_Subway_Line_for_New_York_City,_The_Triborough_System:_Its_History_(1910) |title=A New Subway Line for New York City, The Triborough System: Its History (1910) |publisher=nycsubway.org |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Dual_System_of_Rapid_Transit_(1912) |title=The Dual System of Rapid Transit (1912) |publisher=nycsubway.org |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn August 28, 1922, Mayor John Francis Hylan revealed his own plans for the subway system, which was relatively small at the time. His plan included taking over nearly 100 miles of existing lines and building over 100 miles of new lines. Construction of all these new lines would be completed by December 31, 1925, and passengers would be able to ride between the ends of New York City on one fare. The lines were designed to compete with the IRT and BMT.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Subway Routes Adopted by City |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1923/08/04/archives/two-subway-routes-adopted-by-city-estimate-board-accepts-wash.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 4, 1923 |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plans Now Ready to Start Subways |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/03/12/archives/plans-now-ready-to-start-subways-commission-notifies-city-it-can.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 12, 1924 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, a loop subway service was planned to be built to [[New Jersey]].<ref name=\"nycsubway to nj\">nycsubway.org\u2014[http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Extensive_Rapid_Transit_Plan_Proposed_for_North_Jersey_(1926-1927) Extensive Rapid Transit Plan Proposed for North Jersey (1926-1927)]</ref>\n\nThe most grandiose plan, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated IND. By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included. As this grandiose expansion was not built, the subway system is only 70% of what it was planned to be. Magnificently engineered, almost entirely underground, with {{convert|670|ft|m}} platforms and [[flying junction]]s throughout, the IND system tripled the city's rapid transit debt, ironically contributing to the demise of [[Proposed New York City Subway expansion|plans for an ambitious expansion]] proposed before the first line of the first system was even opened.\n\nBecause of this debt, after the IND Sixth Avenue Line was completed, only 28 new stations were built. Five stations were on the abandoned [[New York, Westchester and Boston Railway|NYW&B]]-operated [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]], fourteen stations were on the abandoned LIRR [[Rockaway Beach Branch]] (now the [[IND Rockaway Line]]), six were on the [[Archer Avenue Lines]] and [[63rd Street Lines]] (built as part of a 1968 plan), two stations ([[57th Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|57th Street]] and [[Grand Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Grand Street]]) were part of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]], and the [[Harlem\u2013148th Street (IRT Lenox Avenue Line)|Harlem\u2013148th Street]] terminal. Four [[MTA Capital Construction]]-funded stations (the [[34th Street (IRT Flushing Line)|34th Street]] station on the [[7 Subway Extension]] and the three stations on the [[Second Avenue Subway]]) have been constructed with up to 14 more planned. However, the four MTA Capital Construction stations cost {{US$|6 billion|link=yes}}, reflecting the scale of the debt that the IND brought the city into.\n\n==Unification{{Anchor|Unification and contraction}}==\n[[File:Second Avenue El - demolition.jpg|thumb|left|The [[IRT Second Avenue Line]], being demolished shortly after unification]]\nIn June 1940, the transportation assets of the former BMT and IRT systems were taken over by the City of New York for operation by the city's Board of Transportation, which already operated the IND system.<ref name=\"nyct facts\"/> In June 1953, the New York City Transit Authority, a state agency incorporated for the benefit of the city, now known to the public as ''MTA New York City Transit'', succeeded the BoT.<ref name=\"nyct facts\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffhist.htm|title=New York City Transit - History and Chronology|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|work=mta.info|access-date=May 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffhist.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021019203759/http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffhist.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2002|title=About NYC Transit - History|last=|first=|date=October 19, 2002|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> A combination of factors had this takeover coincide with the end of the major rapid transit building eras in New York City.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://getpocket.com/explore/item/why-new-york-city-stopped-building-subways|title=Why New York City Stopped Building Subways - CityLab|last=English|first=Jonathan|date=April 16, 2018|website=Pocket|access-date=2019-05-13|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The city immediately began to eliminate what it considered redundancy in the system, closing several elevated lines including the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mta.info/news/2011/10/26/remembering-9th-avenue-el |title=Remembering the 9th Avenue El |work=MTA.info |date=October 26, 2011 |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref> and most of the [[IRT Second Avenue Line]] in Manhattan,<ref name=\"second avenue line\" /> and the [[BMT Fifth Avenue Line|BMT Fifth]] and [[BMT Third Avenue Line|Third Avenue Lines]] and most of the [[BMT Fulton Street Line]]<ref>B.M.T.

A Division cars can travel on B Division lines when necessary but are not used for passenger service on those lines because of the dangerously wide gap between the car and the station platform. This stems from the IRT and BRT's disagreement during the early days of the subway, where the BRT built cars that were purposefully too wide for the IRT.<ref name=\"diehl\">{{cite book |title=The Tracks that Built New York City |author=Diehl, Lorraine |year=2004 |location=New York |isbn=9781400052271 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/subwaystrackstha0000dieh }}</ref>\n\n[[File:NYC Subway Car 1950s.png|thumb|right|The interior of an IRT Third Avenue Line car before the line's demolition in the 1950s.]]\n\nThe original IRT subway lines (those built before the Dual Contracts) were built to modified elevated line dimensions. Whereas the IRT lines were originally equipped with cars that were {{convert|47|ft|m}} long, the cars designed for the IRT subway measure {{convert|51.3|ft|m}} long. Both sets of lines did not permit cars wider than {{convert|9|ft|m}}. The clearances and curves on these lines are too narrow and too sharp for any IND or BMT equipment. The later extensions of the IRT, constituting the bulk of the IRT system, were built to wider dimensions, and so are of a profile that could support the use of IND/BMT sized equipment.  In other words, B Division equipment could operate on much of A Division if station platforms were trimmed and trackside furniture moved, thus letting A Division service carry more passengers. However, there is virtually no chance of this happening because the older, narrower portions of A Division are centrally situated, such that it would be impossible to put together coherent through services. The most that can be reasonably hoped for is that some branch lines of Division A might be resized and attached to B Division lines.

The outsourcing of subway operations to the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] was favored at one point. On June 15, 1953, the NYCTA was founded with the aim of ensuring a cost-covering and efficient operation in the subways.<ref name=\"diehl\" />\n\nThere was a need to overhaul rolling stock and infrastructure of the once-private routes, especially for the IRT, where nearly all of the infrastructure was aged. The oldest cars came there from the time the subway opened in 1904, and the oldest subway cars of BMT in 1953 dated from the system's first years, in 1913. Therefore, a total of 2,860 cars for the A Division were delivered between 1948 and 1965, which constituted the replacement of almost the entire prewar IRT fleet. On the B Division, 2,760 cars were ordered. Platforms were doubled in length systemwide. At some stations, [[gap filler]]s were installed because the station extensions were curved. Also in this period, the BMT replaced their signals. The [[R36 (New York City Subway car)|Main Line R36]] cars were the first equipment to be equipped with two-way radio as delivered standard equipment in 1965, with the first use of radio in the subway system on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] in May 1965, and the  first successful air conditioned train ([[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]]) was placed into service July 19, 1967.<ref>\"New York City Transit Authority: Facts & Figures 1979\", New York City Transit Authority, 1979., pg. 17 (PDF) http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/WAGNER_FILES/06.021.0058.060284.11.PDF</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]] initiated a program to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car trains. The first contract, which was completed on August 8, 1946, extended the platforms at 125th Street, 207th Street, 215th Street, 225th Street, 231st Street and 238th Street on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] for $423,000. Additional platform extensions were completed on the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue LIne on October 18, 1946. On this date the platform extensions at 103rd Street, 110th Street, 116th Street, 137th Street, 145th Street, 157th Street, 168th Street, 181st Street, 191st Street and Dyckman Street were completed. This project cost $3.891 million. The platform extensions at the Hoyt Street station on the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]] opened on November 15, 1946, being completed for $733,200. Stations along the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] were next to receive the improvements. On January 24, 1947, the 23rd Street, 28th Street and 33rd Street platform extensions were completed, costing $4.003 million. Work was subsequently completed at the Bleecker Street and Spring Street stations for $1.97 million. The $1.992 million contract to lengthen the platforms at the Canal Street and Worth Street stations to the south was completed on April 26, 1947. On September 4, 1947, a contract extending the platforms for stations in the Bronx was completed. The first stage of the plan was completed on June 13, 1949, lengthening the platforms at Prospect Avenue, Jackson Avenue, Intervale Avenue, Simpson Street, Freeman Avenue, 174th Street and 177th Street on the IRT White Plains Road Line for $315,000. On September 14, 1949, the Chairman of the Board of Transportation, William Reid, announced that the program to lengthen 32 IRT stations had been completed for $13.327 million. Reid also announced that the Board had created a five-year plan to lengthen all remaining BMT and IRT stations to accommodate ten-car trains.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/09/15/archives/platforms-added-at-32-irt-stations-city-pays-out-13327000-in.html|title=PLATFORMS ADDED AT 32 IRT STATIONS; City Pays Out $13,327,000 in Lengthening Local Stops to Take 10-Car Trains|last=Crowell|first=Paul|date=September 15, 1949|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 4, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nostalgia Train (8892011318).jpg|thumb|right|An [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] train on the [[IND Rockaway Line]], opened in 1956 as one of two major expansions of the system in the mid-20th century]]\nOnly two new lines were opened in this era,<ref name=\":2\" /> the [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]] in 1941<ref name=\":8\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/05/16/archives/rail-line-is-added-to-subway-system-old-westchester-and-boston-road.html|title=Rail Line is Added to Subway System|date=May 16, 1941|page=25|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> and the [[IND Rockaway Line]] in 1956,<ref name=\"NYTimes-INDRkwyOpen-19562\">{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/06/28/84703811.pdf|title=Rockaway Trains to Operate Today|date=June 28, 1956|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|last1=Freeman|first1=Ira Henry|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Rockawave-INDRkwyOpen-June281956\">{{cite news|title=First Train On Rockaway Line Runs This Afternoon|date=June 28, 1956|work=[[Wave of Long Island]]|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|pages=[http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2520-%25200350.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F43c772ea5053ba7a2fe1850240ed52cd#page=1 1], [http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2520-%25200355.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F6b6ee609a1895c1f89ff0c622e5b3813#page=1 6]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252023%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%25201955-1957%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%25201955-1957%2520-%25200650.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F8150b004ade0565d32aa4d88b21d2892#page=1|title=TA's New Line To Rockaways Begins Today: Fifty Piece Band To Play as Special Train Makes First Run|date=June 28, 1956|work=The Leader-Observer|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|page=1|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252023%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Greenpoint%2520Daily%2520Star%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Greenpoint%2520Daily%2520Star%25201956-1957%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Greenpoint%2520Daily%2520Star%25201956-1957%2520-%25200241.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F147cd4c4e78bb11637387bbb8e8e3a06#page=1|title=To Rockaways: Beach Trains In Operation|date=June 29, 1956|work=Greenpoint Weekly Star|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|page=2|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> with an extension of the latter to [[Far Rockaway\u2013Mott Avenue (IND Rockaway Line)|Far Rockaway\u2013Mott Avenue]] in 1958.<ref name=\"NYTImes-FarRkwyIND-Open-1958\">{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/01/16/83388071.pdf|title=New Subway Unit Ready: Far Rockaway IND Terminal Will Be Opened Today|date=January 16, 1958|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Both of these lines were rehabilitations of existing railroad rights-of-way rather than new construction.

In his 1974 book ''[[The Power Broker]]'', [[Robert Caro|Robert A. Caro]] estimated that this amount of money could modernize both the [[Long Island Rail Road]] for $700 million and the [[PATH (rail system)|Hudson & Manhattan Railroad]] for $500 million, with money left over to build the [[Second Avenue Subway]] as well as [[Proposed expansion of the New York City Subway#1954|proposed extensions]] of subway lines in Queens and Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Caro1974\">{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref>{{Rp|928\u2013929}} However, [[Robert Moses]], the city's chief urban planner at the time, did not allow funding for most mass transit expansions in the New York City area,<ref name=\"Caro1974\" />{{Rp|930\u2013933}} instead building highways and parkways without any provisions for mass transit lines in the future.<ref name=\"Caro1974\" />{{Rp|939\u2013958}} Caro noted that the lack of attention to mass transit expansions and routine maintenance contributed to the decline of the subway: \"When Robert Moses came to power in New York in 1934, the city's mass transportation system was probably the best in the world. When he left power in 1968 it was quite possibly the worst.\"<ref name=\"Caro1974\" />{{Rp|933}}\n\nSoon after, the city entered a fiscal crisis. Closures of elevated lines continued. These closures included the entire [[IRT Third Avenue Line]] in Manhattan (1955) and the Bronx (1973), as well as the [[BMT Lexington Avenue Line]] (1950), much of the remainder of the [[BMT Fulton Street Line]] (1956), the downtown Brooklyn part of the [[BMT Myrtle Avenue Line]] (1969), and the [[BMT Culver Shuttle]] (1975), all in [[Brooklyn]], and the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] in [[Queens]] starting in 1977.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> The [[BMT Archer Avenue Line]] was supposed to replace the BMT Jamaica Line's eastern end, but it was never completed to its full extent, and opened in 1988 as a stub-end line, terminating at Jamaica Center.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:BROOKLYN'S BUSHWICK AVENUE SEEN FROM AN ELEVATED TRAIN PLATFORM IN NEW YORK CITY.

Pictured is the remaining portion in 1974]]\n\nIn addition, construction and maintenance of existing lines was deferred, and graffiti and crime were very common. Trains frequently broke down, were poorly maintained, and were often late, while ridership declined by the millions each year. As in all of the city, crime was rampant in the subway in the 1970s. Thefts, robberies, shootings and killings became more frequent. The rolling stock was very often graffiti-painted or vandalism-damaged both inside and outside. As the [[New York City Police Department]] was completely overwhelmed, the public reacted with unease, and the subway was deliberately avoided. Around 1980, the reliability of the vehicles was a tenth of their reliability in the 1960s, and 40 percent of the network required speed restrictions. Because there had been no further studies of the subway since 1975, one third of the fleet was out of use during rush hours due to serious technical defects. In addition, signs were fitted incorrectly, and spare parts were missing or were bought in too large quantities, could not be found, or could not be installed due to lack of repairmen.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n\nThe New York City Subway tried to keep its budget balanced between spending and revenue, so deferred maintenance became more common, which drew a slow but steady decline of the system and rolling stock. Furthermore, the workers were consolidated into the [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union]] in 1968. A pension was set up, and workers were allowed to retire after 20 years of service without any transitional period. About a third of the most highly experienced staff immediately retired, resulting in a large shortage of skilled workers.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n\nOnly in the 1980s did an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway start. Between 1985 and 1991 over 3,000 subway cars were overhauled and fitted with [[air conditioning]]. In this way, comfort, reliability and durability would be increased in order to postpone new purchases. The TA only replaced the oldest cars each division, so that despite the fact that the fleet was overaged, the TA bought only 1,350 new vehicles. Increased patrols and fences around the train yards offered better protection against graffiti and vandalism.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> At the same time, the TA began an extensive renovation of the routes. Within ten years the tracks were thereby renewed almost systemwide. The Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, which had strong corrosion damage, were refurbished over the years. The renovation of the stations was initially limited to security measures, fresh paint, new lighting and signs, but the TA also tried to improve the service that had been neglected. This ranged from new uniforms and training for the staff to correct destination signs on the rolling stock. Some [[List of New York City Subway services|subway services]] were also adapted to the changing needs of customers.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> Another stated goal was to reduce crime or at least an improvement in the subjective sense of security. At night, the railway police and members of the citizens' initiative [[Guardian Angels]], formed in 1979, patrolled in the subway trains.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> It was not until the 1990s that the crime in the city and its subway declined significantly.\n\n=== Late 1950s and early 1960s ===\nIn 1956, the NYCTA chairman, Charles Patterson, proposed removing the seats from the trains on the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] to increase the passenger load.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/01/25/86510389.pdf|title=Seatless I.R.T.

Some lines had service run as infrequently as 30 minutes. Also on this date, BMT express service was extended to 57th Street from 42nd Street. Earlier in 1957, local service on the BMT Jamaica Line was extended to Crescent Street from Eastern Parkway, and rush hour service was increased to run every 5 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Annual Report For The Year Ended June 30, 1957|last=|first=|date=October 1957|website=|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|page=9|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUnder a $100 million rebuilding program, increased and lengthened service was implemented during peak hours on the '''1''' train. Switching at a junction north of 96th Street, delayed service as trains from the Lenox Avenue Line which ran local switched from the express to the local, while trains from the Broadway Branch that ran express switched from the local to the express. This bottleneck was removed on February 6, 1959. All Broadway trains were locals, and all Lenox Avenue trains were expresses, eliminating the need to switch tracks. All '''3''' trains began to run express south of 96th Street on that date running to Brooklyn. '''1''' trains began to run between 242nd Street and South Ferry all times. Trains began to be branded as Hi-Speed Locals, being as fast as the old express service was with 8-car trains consisting of new [[R21 (New York City Subway car)|R21s]] and [[R22 (New York City Subway car)|R22s]] on the line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/27076258093/|title=New Hi-Speed Locals 1959 New York City Transit Authority|website=Flickr - Photo Sharing!|accessdate=June 15, 2016|date=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nOn November 15, 1962, the express platforms at [[Lexington Avenue/59th Street (New York City Subway)|Lexington Avenue\u201359th Street]] opened to reduce transfer congestion at [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]], and to allow transfers between the express trains and BMT trains to [[Queens]].

In January 1977, to both save money and increase safety, subway trains were shortened during off hours. By October 1977, a planned Metropolitan Transportation Center at Third Avenue and 48th Street was dropped. LIRR trains using the 63rd Street tunnel would run to Grand Central, whenever that line would be built. $63 million had been spent on [[Second Avenue Subway]] construction through December 1978, even though subway construction only consisted of three short segments of tunnel when it was halted in April 1975. Ridership kept dropping rapidly; it dropped by 25 million passengers between June 30, 1976, and June 30, 1977, and within a span of eight years, 327 million passengers stopped using the subway. Some estimated that if this rate of decline were to continue, there would be no passengers on the system by 2002.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nAs a result of declining ridership, the number of subway cars used during the morning rush hours dropped from 5,557 in 1974 to about 4,900 in 1978. Headways were increased, too, so people were waiting longer periods of time for shorter trains that were intensely crowded. Headways on the A, D, N and RR services were 5 minutes during rush hours (or 12 trains per hour) in 1978; they were 4 minutes (or 15 trains per hour) in 1974.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/14/archives/215-more-daily-subway-runs-will-be-eliminated-by-aug-30-215-more.html|title=215 More Daily Subway Runs Will Be Eliminated by Aug. 30|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=August 14, 1976|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=New York Times Archive}}</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1975, the NYCTA announced that in September of that year 94 daily IRT trips would be discontinued, accounting for 4 percent of then-existing service on the IRT.

The cutbacks, the third of the year, trimmed 279 train runs from the previous 6,900. Service was most drastically reduced on the Lexington Avenue Line, with seven fewer express trains during the morning rush hour heading southbound. The cuts were the first of a three-phase program that was put in effect between January and July 1976. The cuts permitted a savings of $12.6 million a year for the NYCTA, which had an increasing deficit. Other subway services were changed or discontinued as part of the plan. On January 19, F trains were planned to stop running express in Brooklyn, and the GG was to be cut back to [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]].

During midday hours, trains on the 1 were to be shortened to five cars. In July, it was planned that the EE would be discontinued; N trains were to have been extended to Continental Avenue via the Queens Boulevard Line to replace it. Manhattan-bound N trains were to continue running express, while in the opposite direction they would run local. N trains would alternate between terminating at Whitehall Street or Coney Island during rush hours. CC trains, in July, were planned to be extended from Hudson Terminal to Rockaway Park replacing the E, which was to have been cut back to Hudson Terminal.

On May 20, 1970, two people died at the [[Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street (New York City Subway)|Jackson Heights\u2013Roosevelt Avenue]] station in the worst subway collision since the [[1928 Times Square derailment]].

About 85.8% of trains were on schedule in 1970, with 1,142 equipment-related delays in April 1970.<ref name=\"nym 19700623\"/> However, issues such as broken lights, fans, and signs; defective doors, wheels, and brakes; and subway cars that often became uncoupled or \"pulled apart\", were still prevalent. One out of three IRT stations did not have running water in case of emergency. In addition, the system's staff were leaving in massive numbers, with 5,655 workers having retired or quit from early 1969 to mid-1970.<ref name=\"nym 19700623\"/>\n\nIn the late 1970s, hundreds of slow speed orders were found throughout the system due to the risk of derailments. Graffiti covered every single subway car in the system, and the number of available cars for rush hour services continued to drop, from 5,557 in 1976, then to 5,025 in 1977, and finally to 4,900 in May 1978. Mean Distance Between Failures (MDBF) rates were at all time lows, as the MDBF rate system-wide was 6,000 miles by 1980. Maintenance on rolling stock was so bad that by 1979, 200 retired [[R16 (New York City Subway car)|R16]] cars were put back into service to replace the newest rolling stock in the system, the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]]. Most R46s had cracked trucks, and were only allowed to operate during rush hours as they were sent for rehabilitation.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nAt the height of the transit crisis in 1983, on-time performance dropped below 50%.<ref name=\"CapitalProgram\">{{cite web|url=http://wagner.nyu.edu/files/news/rescue.pdf|title=From Rescue to Renaissance: The Achievements of the MTA Capital Program 1982 - 2004|last2=de Cerre\u00f1o|first2=Allison L.

The worst subway station overall, in terms of crime and its condition, was [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]], while the worst elevated station was [[Metropolitan Avenue (BMT Myrtle Avenue Line)|Metropolitan Avenue]] in Queens. The subway cars in the worst condition were the [[R10 (New York City Subway car)|R10s]]. The subway line with the worst signals was the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], so the signals were upgraded in the 1980s. The track in the worst shape was that of the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]], which had more or less the same infrastructure as when it opened in 1915.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n\nEven with the addition of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, less than half of the $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It had to do this with a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime was out of control, and for a while it was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nDue to deferred maintenance, the condition of the subway system reached dangerous conditions in the early 1980s; new construction was, by then, considered ludicrous. Even as the only new construction was going on in the 63rd Street Line, Manhattan residents at the vicinity of York Avenue and East 63rd Street protested over the MTA's intention to build a ventilation shaft for the line. During the early 1980s, work on the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue lines continued, although the MTA considered stopping work on these projects in October 1980, and spending the money instead on maintaining the existing system.\n\nStructural defects were found in elevated structures systemwide and on the [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge|Williamsburg]] Bridges, causing frequent closures or delays on many subway lines during the 1980s. Reroutes from both bridges were necessitated; while the Manhattan Bridge, between 1986 and 2004, had two of its four tracks closed at a time for construction, the Williamsburg Bridge needed a shutdown from April to June 1988 for emergency structural repairs to be made.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> Federal funding for the repair of the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] was deferred throughout the 1980s due to the extremely bad state of the Williamsburg Bridge. On the bridge, pigeon droppings corroded the bridge's steel, broken cable strands suspending the bridge numbered over 200, and concrete in the bridge began to come off and leave large holes.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nDue to low ridership and the increasing shabbiness of the subway, parts or most of several lines\u2014the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]; the [[IND Crosstown Line]]; either the [[IND Concourse Line]] or the [[IRT Jerome Avenue Line]] north of [[161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium (New York City Subway)|161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium]]; and the BMT Jamaica Line east of either [[Broadway Junction (BMT Jamaica Line)|Broadway Junction]] or [[Cypress Hills (BMT Jamaica Line)|Cypress Hills]]\u2014were proposed for closure and abandonment in 1981. Other lines proposed for closure included the remaining part of the [[IND Culver Line]], the [[BMT West End Line]], the [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]], part of the [[IND Rockaway Line]], part of the [[IRT White Plains Road Line]], and the remaining part of the [[BMT Myrtle Avenue Line]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/30/nyregion/calls-for-subway-service-cuts-rise-as-system-continues-to-limp-along.html|title=Calls for Subway Service Cuts Rise as System Continues to Limp Along|last=Goldman|first=Ari L.|date=1981-12-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In fact, the eastern part of the BMT Jamaica Line was actually demolished, mainly as part of the Program for Action, but also due to low ridership.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> Officials also proposed shutting the subway at night between midnight and 6 a.m. in order to reduce crime.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/16/nyregion/6-hour-nightly-shutdown-of-subways-is-proposed.html|title=6-Hour Nightly Shutdown of Subways Is Proposed|last=Cummings|first=Judith|date=1981-07-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Off-peak train trips, as well as trips on the branches outside the city's core, were reduced sharply.<ref>{{cite web | title=Subway Service Shuffled to Cope In Repair 'Crisis'; Off-Peak Runs Will Be Cut for a Rush-Hour Reserve 'This Program Will Be Painful' Trouble-Shooters Added Subway Service Shuffled to Cope in a Repair 'Crisis' | work=The New York Times | date=November 5, 1980 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/05/112168722.pdf | access-date=February 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, operation on the New York City Subway was so bad that:<ref>\"Plan to put new cops on train patrol,\" ''Daily News'' (New York), January 28, 1982, page 23.</ref><ref>\"Source for all the bullets: Can We Save Our Subways,\" ''Daily News'' (New York), January 25, 1981, page 7.</ref>\n* In January 1981, there was one Tuesday where {{frac|1|3}} of the subway fleet was not in service.

Infrastructure was not routinely inspected and few repairs were made until a failure occurred. Most rolling stock had gone unmaintained and unrepaired since 1975. The average [[Mean Distance Between Failures]] in 1981 was 6,639 miles, down from 13,900 in 1977 and 24,000 in 1970.\n* The [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]] and [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46s]], the newest cars in the system, made up {{frac|1|4}} of the B Division's 4,178 subway cars. Even thought they were the newest cars, they had a variety of problems. The R46s broke down the most and had cracked trucks, while the R44s had issues because of the sophisticated technology that was installed in anticipation of operating on a fully automated [[IND Second Avenue Line]].<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nIn 1986, the MTA and [[Regional Plan Association]] again considered closing {{Convert|26|mi|km}} of above-ground lines to follow population shifts. They included the Jerome Avenue, Dyre Avenue, Franklin Avenue, Crosstown, and Rockaway lines, as well as parts of the Myrtle and Jamaica lines. The south end of the Culver Line and the north ends of the IRT [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line|Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue]] and White Plains Road Lines were also proposed for closure, as was all of the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]].

There were other rampant crimes as well, so that two hundred were arrested for possible subway crimes in the first two weeks of December 1977, under an operation dubbed \"Subway Sweep\". Passengers were afraid of the subway because of its crime, angry over long waits for trains that were shortened to save money, and upset over the general malfunctioning of the system. The subway also had many dark subway cars.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> Further compounding the issue, on July 13, 1977, a [[New York City blackout of 1977|blackout]] cut off electricity to most of the city and to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]].<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> Due to a sudden increase of violent crimes on the subway in the last week of 1978, police statistics about crime in the subway were being questioned. In 1979, six murders on the subway occurred in the first two months of the year, compared to nine during the entire previous year. The [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] was known to frequent muggers, so in February 1979, a group headed by [[Curtis Sliwa]], began unarmed patrols of the {{NYCS|4}} train during the night time, in an effort to discourage crime. They were known as the [[Guardian Angels]], and would eventually expand their operations into other parts of the five boroughs.

Two weeks after Koch's request, top TA cops were publicly requesting Transit Police Chief [[Sanford Garelik]]'s resignation because they claimed that he lost control of the fight against subway crime. Finally, on September 11, 1979, Garelik was fired, and replaced with Deputy Chief of Personnel [[James B. Meehan]], reporting directly to City Police Commissioner [[Robert McGuire]]. Garelik continued in his role of chief of security for the MTA.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> By September 1979, around 250 felonies per week (or about 13,000 that year) were being recorded on the subway, making the crime rate the most of any other mass transit network anywhere in the world. Some police officers supposedly could not act upon [[quality of life]] crimes, and that they should only look for violent crimes. Among other problems included:\n\n{{Quote|MTA police radios and [[New York City Police Department]] radios transmitted at different frequencies, so they could not coordinate with each other. Subway patrols were also adherent to tight schedules, and felons quickly knew when and where police would make patrols.

When TA's Fare Abuse Task Force (FATF) was convened in January 1989, evasion was 3.9%. After a 15-cent fare increase to $1.15 in August 1990, a record 231,937 people per day, or 6.9%, didn't pay.

Arrests weren't the only way to combat evasions, and by the early 1990s NYCTA was examining methods to improve fare control passenger throughputs, reduce fare collection costs, and maintain control over evasions and general grime. The AFC system was being designed, and evasion-preventing capability was a key consideration.\n\nTA's queuing studies concluded that purchasing tokens from clerks was not efficient. Preventing '[[Slug (coin)|slug]]' use required sophisticated measures like tokens with metal alloy centers and electronic [[token coin|token]] verification devices. To provide better access control, the NYCTA experimented with floor-to-ceiling gates and \u201chigh wheel\u201d turnstiles. Prototypes installed at [[110th Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|110th Street/Lexington Avenue station]] during a \u201ctarget hardening\u201d trial reduced evasions compared to nearby \u201ccontrol\u201d stations.<ref>Weidner, Robert R.

New turnstiles, including unstaffed high wheels, and floor-to-ceiling service gates, featured lessons learned from trials. As AFC equipment was rolled out, evasion plummeted.

It stated: \"Almost all of the projects are well ahead of the goal recommended five years ago. Despite technical setbacks, legal roadblocks, administrative frustrations and limited funding, progress has been substantial.\" Other improvements, not stated in the report, were also being done. As of 1973, progress had been made on several projects, the first six of which were Program for Action projects:\n* The [[63rd Street Tunnel]] was completed and outfitting for the new lines that were to run through it was to begin in early 1974.\n* Three new subway lines were under construction (63rd Street, Second Avenue, and Archer Avenue Lines).\n* Eight new subway lines were under design.\n* Two underground crosstown people-movers were being studied.\n* Rolling stock ordered during these years had a common front end, with a silver finish with a blue stripe along the side:\n** 800 new [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40]] and [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] subway cars were placed into service. In 1968, 27% of the fleet was considered to be beyond retirement age (which was said to be 30 years if a subway car is properly maintained); in 1973, this was halved to about 14%. In 1968, there were 6,975 subway cars in the fleet, of which 1,883 were beyond their useful lives; by 1973, there were 6,826 cars in the fleet, of which 956 were beyond their useful lives.\n** The first 8-car train of [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]] was placed into revenue service on December 16, 1971, on a one-month trial. The first train of R44s in \"permanent\" revenue service left 179th Street - Jamaica on the {{NYCS|F}} train on April 19, 1972. By 1973, 300 R44s were placed in service and 745 [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]] subway cars were ordered from Pullman Standard (and this number would increase slightly to 754 cars). The first four R46 cars would be delivered on March 27, 1975, and would be tested on the express tracks of the Sea Beach Line.

The segments are primarily located in low-income neighborhoods of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, with a total of 79 stations, and 45 miles of track, for a total of 6.5 percent of the system. The lines were first identified in the first part of a three-year project, the Strategic Plan Initiative, which started in April 1985, by the MTA to evaluate the region's bus, subway, and commuter rail systems. The eleven segments all had low ridership, needed expensive rebuilding, and duplicated service on parallel lines.

After 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most lines for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies.  The first line of the city-owned and operated [[Independent Subway System]] (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down.  However, it was kept within the core of the city because of the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal [[New York City Board of Transportation|Board of Transportation]] by the state.<ref name=\"Hood, Clifton 2004\">{{cite book |title=722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York\n |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/722_Miles.html?id=0YfdjUgMAscC\n |author=Clifton Hood |isbn=978-0801880544 |year=2004 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}</ref> This required it to be run \"at cost\", necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/historyindependentsubway.html\n |title=History of the Independent Subway|date=2000\n |website=nycsubway.org|publisher=nycsubway.org|author=Mark S. Feinman|accessdate=July 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the city took over running the previously privately operated systems.  Some elevated lines closed immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was slow, but [[List of New York City Subway inter-division connections|several connections]] were built between the IND and BMT, which now operate as one division called the [[B Division (New York City Subway)|B Division]].  Since IRT infrastructure is [[Structure gauge|too small]] for B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the [[A Division (New York City Subway)|A Division]].\n\nThe NYCTA, a public authority presided over by New York City, was created in 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations from the city.<ref name=\"nyct facts\"/> The NYCTA was under control of the state-level MTA in 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitmuseumeducation.org/trc/background |title=New York Transit Museum - Teacher Resource Center - History of Public Transportation in New York City |publisher=Transitmuseumeducation.org |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}</ref> Soon after the MTA took control of the subway, New York City entered a fiscal crisis. It closed many elevated subway lines that became too expensive to maintain. Graffiti and crime became common, and equipment and stations fell into decrepit condition. The New York City Subway tried to stay solvent, so it had to make many service cutbacks and defer necessary maintenance projects. In the 1980s an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway began.\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] resulted in [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks#NYC Subway|service disruptions]], particularly on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], which ran directly underneath the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].  Sections of the tunnel, as well as the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street station]], which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely damaged and had to be rebuilt, requiring suspension of service on that line south of Chambers Street.  Ten other nearby stations were temporarily closed.  By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line) reopened on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street.<ref name=\"tunnelvision\" /><ref name=\"brianabbott.net\">[http://brianabbott.net/observations/2004/09/11/september-11-three-years-later Brian Abbott.

At that time, [[New York County]] (Manhattan Island and part of the Bronx), Kings County (including the cities of Brooklyn and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]), and Queens County were separate municipal entities. Competing steam-powered elevated railroads were built over major avenues. The first elevated line was constructed in 1867-1870 by Charles Harvey and his [[West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway]] company along Greenwich Street and Ninth Avenue (although [[Cable car (railway)|cable cars]] were the initial mode of transportation on that railway). More lines were built on [[IRT Second Avenue Line|Second]], [[IRT Third Avenue Line|Third]] and [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth]] Avenues. None of these structures remain today, but these lines later shared trackage with subway trains as part of the IRT system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Transit in New York |publisher=NYCSubway.org |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Early_Rapid_Transit_In_New_York |accessdate=October 29, 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn Kings County, elevated railroads were built by several companies, over [[BMT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington]], [[BMT Myrtle Avenue Line|Myrtle]], [[BMT Third Avenue Line|Third]] and [[BMT Fifth Avenue Line|Fifth]] Avenues, [[BMT Fulton Street Line|Fulton Street]] and [[BMT Broadway (Brooklyn) Line|Broadway]]. These also later shared trackage with subway trains, and even operated into the subway, as part of the BRT and BMT. Most of these structures have been dismantled, but some have been rebuilt and upgraded. These lines were linked to Manhattan by various ferries and later the tracks along the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] (which originally had their own line and were later integrated into the BRT/BMT). Also in Kings County, six [[steam railroad|steam excursion railroads]] were built to various beaches in the southern part of the county; all but one (the Manhattan Beach Line) eventually fell under BMT control.<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Transit in Brooklyn |publisher=NYCSubway.org |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Early_Rapid_Transit_in_Brooklyn,_1878-1913 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Beach Pneumatic Transit===\n[[File:Beach Pneumatic Transit 01.jpg|thumb|right|Beach Pneumatic Transit]]\nThe [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] was the first attempt to build an underground [[public transit]] system in New York City. In 1869, [[Alfred Ely Beach]] and his Beach Pneumatic Transit Company of New York began constructing a pneumatic subway line beneath [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]].

Passengers would simply ride out and back, to see what the proposed subway might be like.

The act provided that the commission would lay out routes with the consent of property owners and local authorities, either build the system or sell a franchise for its construction, and lease it to a private operating company. A line through [[Lafayette Street (Manhattan)|Lafayette Street]] (then Elm Street)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/1999/09/lower-manhattan-necrology-continued/|title=Lower Manhattan Necrology (continued) - Forgotten New York|website=forgotten-ny.com|accessdate=October 20, 2016|date=September 3, 1999}}</ref> to [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] was considered, but at first a more costly route under lower Broadway was adopted. A legal battle with property owners along the route led to the courts denying permission to build through Broadway in 1896. The Elm Street route was chosen later that year, cutting west to Broadway via [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. This new plan, formally adopted on January 14, 1897, consisted of a line from [[City Hall, Manhattan|City Hall]] north to [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] and a branch under [[Lenox Avenue]] and to [[Bronx Park]], to have four tracks from City Hall to the junction at 103rd Street. The \"awkward alignment...along Forty-Second Street\", as the commission put it, was necessitated by objections to using Broadway south of [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]]. Legal challenges were finally resolved in 1899.<ref>James Blaine Walker, [https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsrapid00walkgoog Fifty Years of Rapid Transit, 1864-1917], published 1918, pp. 139-161</ref>\n\n[[File:New York City Subway construction 1901.jpg|thumb|Subway construction in the Bowery, 1901]]\nThe city decided to issue rapid transit [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] outside of its regular bonded [[debt limit]] and build the subways itself; it contracted with the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (which by that time ran the elevated lines in Manhattan) to equip and operate the subways, sharing the profits with the city and guaranteeing a fixed five-cent fare.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org dualsystem\">nycsubway.org \u2014 [http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Dual_System_of_Rapid_Transit_(1912) The Dual System of Rapid Transit (1912)]</ref>\n\n====BRT====\n{{Main|Rapid transit operations of the BRT and BMT}}\nStarting in 1899, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; 1896\u20131923) and Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT; 1923\u20131940) operated rapid transit lines in New York City \u2014 at first only elevated railways and later also subways.\n\nThe BRT was incorporated January 18, 1896,<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]] | location = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, NY]] | url =  |title=L.I.

The Triborough Plan comprised three new lines:\n* An IRT line from [[South Ferry\u2013Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry\u2013Whitehall Street]] in Manhattan, with the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] to [[Pelham Bay Park (IRT Pelham Line)|Pelham Bay Park]] and [[Woodlawn (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|Woodlawn]] in the Bronx\n* The BRT [[Nassau Street Loop]], later the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]]. The BRT's track went over the [[Brooklyn Bridge|Brooklyn]], [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]], and [[Williamsburg Bridge]]s; the Nassau Street Line was to connect to the Brooklyn Bridge, but never did. The connections to the other two bridges were built; the Manhattan Bridge connection was cut in 1967 with the building of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]].\n* A BRT subway under [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]] in Brooklyn, leading to [[Bay Ridge\u201395th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Bay Ridge]] and [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island]]. This corresponded to today's [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]] and the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]].\n\nThe BRT lines were built to wider profiles because the BRT did not want to use IRT trackage, which was narrower by comparison and carried far fewer passengers per hour.  The design was inspired by the cars built for the [[Red Line (MBTA)#Rolling stock|Cambridge Subway (Red Line)]] which were designed based on the results of studies done on how best to design and operate a subway car that could carry the most passengers the most efficiently. The [[rolling stock]], however, had to be the same [[track gauge]] so the trains could interoperate under the Dual Contracts. The Fourth Avenue and Sea Beach Lines were opened on June 19, 1915, after years of delays for building of these lines and the Nassau Street Line. The first BRT section, however, had opened on September 16, 1908, from [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] across the [[Williamsburg Bridge]], but using narrow-width cars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/09/17/105012048.pdf|title=MAYOR RUNS A TRAIN OVER NEW BRIDGE|last=|first=|date=September 17, 1908|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|page=16|access-date=October 30, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nUntil the completion of the Fourth Avenue Line, there was a tram across the Manhattan Bridge which did not connect to any other trackage in the New York City Subway. The track was called \"[[Manhattan Bridge Three Cent Line]]\" because the fare was three cents. Along with the [[Brooklyn and North River Railroad]], the two streetcar companies began operations on those tracks. When trackage was connected to the bridge in 1915, the trolleys were moved to the upper level roadways until 1929, when service was discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/BMT_4th_Avenue_Line|title=BMT 4th Avenue Line|last=Feinman|first=Mark|last2=Darlington|first2=Peggy|date=2012|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=October 30, 2016|last3=Pirmann|first3=David|last4=Brennan|first4=Joseph}}</ref>\n\n====Dual Contracts====\n{{main|Dual Contracts}}\n\nThe BRT, which just barely entered Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge, wanted the opportunity to compete with the IRT, and the IRT wanted to extend its Brooklyn line to compete with the BRT. This led to the city's agreement to contract for future subways with both the BRT and IRT.\n\nThe expansion of rapid transit was greatly facilitated by the signing of the Dual Contracts on March 19, 1913. ''Contract 3'' was signed between the IRT and the city; the contract between the BRT and the city was ''Contract 4''. The majority of the present-day subway system was either built or improved under these contracts.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org dualsystem\"/> The [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]] and [[IRT Flushing Line|Flushing Line]] were built at this time and were for some time operated by both companies. Under the terms of Contracts 3 and 4, the city would build new subway and elevated lines, rehabilitate and expand certain existing elevated lines, and lease them to the private companies for operation. The cost would be borne more-or-less equally by the city and the companies. The city's contribution was in cash raised by bond offerings, while the companies' contributions were variously by supplying cash, facilities, and equipment to run the lines.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org dualsystem\"/>\n\n[[File:Queensboro Plaza.png|thumb|left|250px|The track layout of [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]] was complex because the Contracts necessitated two different types of [[rolling stock]] and two different [[fare control]] areas.]]\n\nAs part of the contracts, the two companies were to share lines in Queens: a short line to [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] called the [[BMT Astoria Line|Astoria Line]]; and a longer line reaching initially to [[Corona, Queens|Corona]], and eventually to [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], called the [[IRT Flushing Line|Corona Line]]. The lines operated jointly and began from [[Queensboro Plaza (New York City Subway)|Queensboro Plaza]]. The IRT accessed the station both from the 1907 [[Steinway Tunnel]] and an extension of the [[IRT Second Avenue Line|Second Avenue Elevated]] from Manhattan over the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. The BRT fed the Queens lines from a new tunnel from the [[60th Street Tunnel]] to Manhattan. Technically the line was under IRT ownership, but the BRT/BMT was granted [[trackage rights]] in perpetuity, essentially making it theirs also.<ref name=\"diehl\"/><ref name=\"derrick\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Derrick |title=Tunneling to the Future: The Story of the Great Subway Expansion that Saved New York |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0814719107}}</ref> However, both lines were built to IRT specifications. This meant that IRT passengers had a one-seat ride to Manhattan destinations, whereas BRT passengers had to make a change at Queensborough Plaza. This came to be important when service was extended for the [[1939 World's Fair]], as the IRT was able to offer direct express trains from Manhattan, and the BRT was not. This practice lasted well into the municipal ownership of the lines and was not ended until 1949.<ref name=\"diehl\"/><ref name=\"derrick\"/>\n\nSeveral provisions were imposed on the companies: the fare was limited to five cents, and this led to financial troubles for the two companies after post-[[World War I]] inflation; the city had the right to \"recapture\" any of the lines it built and run them as its own; and the city was to share in the profits. This eventually led to their downfall and consolidation into city ownership in 1940.<ref name=\"diehl\"/><ref name=\"derrick\"/>\n\nAs part of the Dual Contracts, the operations of the original IRT system changed drastically. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turn onto 42nd Street, and finally turn onto Park Avenue, there were two trunk lines connected by the [[42nd Street Shuttle]]. The system was changed from a \"Z\" system to an \"H\" system. The first trunk line, the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington Avenue Line]] assumed the portion of the original IRT system south of Grand Central. The line was extended northward with a new station at Grand Central and turned onto Lexington Avenue, where the line remained as four tracks. The line had connections to the new IRT Pelham Line and IRT Jerome Avenue Line in the Bronx, in addition to a new connection to the IRT White Plains Road Line. The second trunk, the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line assumed the portion of the original IRT system north of Times Square, and it extended southward with a new station at Times Square, running down Seventh Avenue, Varick Street and West Broadway. It was predicted that the subway extension would lead to the growth of the Lower West Side, and to neighborhoods such as [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Greenwich Village]]. South of Chambers Street, two branches were constructed. The first branch ran to the Battery via Greenwich Street, while the second branch turned eastward under Park Place and Beeckman Street and down William Street, running under the East River through a tunnel before running under Clark Street and Fulton Street until it reached a junction at Borough Hall with the existing Contract 2 IRT Brooklyn Line.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/03/10/118138743.pdf|title=THE SEVENTH AND LEXINGTON AVENUE SUBWAYS WILL REVIVE DORMANT SECTIONS; Change in Operation That Will Transform Original Four-Tracked Subway Into Two Four-Tracked Systems and Double Present Capacity of the Interborough.

They helped alleviate densely population areas and probably helped save lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. The population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased between the years of 1910 and 1920.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/06/13/96355601.pdf|title=LOWER MANHATTAN LOST IN POPULATION|last=|first=|date=June 13, 1920|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=October 30, 2016|via=}}</ref> People were allowed to move to better parts at the same cost and could have a better and more comfortable life in the suburbs.<ref name=\"derrick\"/>{{rp|page=7}}\n\n===Independent System===\n{{main|Independent Subway System}}\nMayor [[John Francis Hylan|John F. Hylan]] was a strong advocate of public operation of the subway. He was fired from the BRT after working as a [[Motorman (locomotive)|motorman]] for some time, and he wanted to avoid having to spend more money to recapture the IRT and BRT, so he tried to push the two operators out of business. To that end, Hylan had denied allocating money for the BRT by refusing to build new lines, refusing to raise fares (thereby putting the BRT in more debt), denied building permits so that some major building work lasted longer than planned, and even refused to build a new subway yard for the BRT. The [[Malbone Street Wreck]] in 1918 contributed to the losses incurred by the two companies, which led to the bankruptcy of the BRT in 1918. The BRT, however, was reorganized into the BMT. The IRT was almost bankrupt, but managed to complete the [[IRT Flushing Line|line to Flushing]] by 1928. So, Hylan drew up plans for a third subway network, which would be built and operated in contrast to the existing subway lines, which were privately operated.<ref name=\"diehl\"/>\n\nOn the other hand, New York City had grown to over five and a half million inhabitants and urgently needed new subway lines. The dual system could not keep pace with this ever-increasing ridership. So, a compromise solution was finally found that would allow Hylan's plans as well as the interests of private operators to be considered. However, the city's and Hylan's long-term goal was the unification and consolidation of the existing subway, with the city operating a unified subway system. The city, bolstered by political claims that the private companies were reaping profits at taxpayer expense, determined that it would build, equip and operate a new system itself, with private investment and without sharing the profits with private entities.  This led to the building of the ''Independent City-Owned Subway'' (ICOS), sometimes called the ''Independent Subway System'' (ISS), the ''Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad'', or simply ''The Eighth Avenue Subway'' after the location of its [[IND Eighth Avenue Line|premier Manhattan mainline]]. After the city acquired the BMT and IRT in 1940, the Independent lines were dubbed the ''[[Independent Subway System|IND]]'' to follow the three-letter [[initialism]]s of the other systems.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/>\n\nThe original IND system, consisting of the Eighth Avenue mainline and the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue]], [[IND Concourse Line|Concourse]], [[IND Culver Line|Culver]], and [[IND Queens Boulevard Line|Queens Boulevard]] branch lines, was entirely underground in the four boroughs that it served, with the exception of the [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]] and [[Fourth Avenue (IND Culver Line)|Fourth Avenue]] stations on the [[Culver Viaduct]] over the [[Gowanus Canal]] in [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/>\n\n====Lines====\nAs the first line neared completion, New York City offered it for private operation as a formality, knowing that no operator would meet its terms. Thus the city declared that it would operate it itself, formalizing a foregone conclusion. The first line opened without a formal ceremony. The trains began operating their regular schedules ahead of time, and all stations of the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line|Eighth Avenue Line]], from [[207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|207th Street]] in [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] to [[Hudson Terminal (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Hudson Terminal]] (now World Trade Center), opened simultaneously at one minute after midnight on September 10, 1932.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D13F7395513738DDDA90994D1405B828FF1D3|title=Gay Midnight Crowd Rides First Trains in New Subway|last=|first=|date=September 10, 1932|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=1|access-date=October 30, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1936, a second trunk line\u2014the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Avenue Line]]\u2014opened from [[West Fourth Street \u2013 Washington Square (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|West Fourth Street]] (where it splits from the Eighth Avenue Line) to [[East Broadway (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|East Broadway]].<ref name=\"laguardia opens link\">{{cite news |title=LaGuardia Opens New Subway Link |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/01/02/archives/la-guardia-opens-new-subway-link-warmly-praises-delaney-as-he-puts.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 2, 1936 |page=1 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Two Subway Links Start Wednesday |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/06/archives/two-subway-links-start-wednesday-city-will-begin-operating-fulton.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 1936 |page=23 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=New Subway Link Opened by Mayor |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D13FF385B1B7B93CBA9178FD85F428385F9 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 1936 |page=23 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> During construction, streetcar service along Sixth Avenue was terminated.

Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. The [[Great Depression]] resulted in soaring costs, and the expansion became unmanageable, so it was not built along with the other three IND trunk lines. Construction on the first phase of the IND was already behind schedule, and the city and state were no longer able to provide funding. A scaled-down proposal including a turnoff at 34th Street and a connection crosstown was postponed in 1931.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/> Further revision of the plan and more studies followed. By 1939, construction had been postponed indefinitely, and Second Avenue was relegated to \"proposed\" status. The 1939 plan for subway expansion took the line not only into the Bronx (by now as a single line to [[Throggs Neck]]) but also south into Brooklyn, connecting to the stub of the [[IND Fulton Street Line]] at [[Court Street (IND Fulton Street Line)|Court Street]]. Construction of the line resumed in 1972 but was ended in 1975 during the city's fiscal crisis, and work was again restarted in 2007.<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/>\n\n===Expansion plans===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|width1=184|width2=212\n|image1=1929 IND Second System.jpg|caption1=1929 [[IND Second System|expansion plans]]\n|image2=1939 IND Second System.jpg|caption2=1939 expansion plans\n}}\n{{Main|Proposed New York City Subway expansion}}\nSince the [[Early history of the IRT subway|opening]] of the original New York City Subway line in 1904, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. One of the better known proposals was the \"Second System,\" which was part of a plan by the Independent Subway to construct new subway lines in addition and take over existing subway lines and railroad right-of-ways. Though most of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the [[Second Avenue Subway]]. Plans for new lines date back to the early 1910s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/A_New_Subway_Line_for_New_York_City,_The_Triborough_System:_Its_History_(1910) |title=A New Subway Line for New York City, The Triborough System: Its History (1910) |publisher=nycsubway.org |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Dual_System_of_Rapid_Transit_(1912) |title=The Dual System of Rapid Transit (1912) |publisher=nycsubway.org |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn August 28, 1922, Mayor John Francis Hylan revealed his own plans for the subway system, which was relatively small at the time. His plan included taking over nearly 100 miles of existing lines and building over 100 miles of new lines. Construction of all these new lines would be completed by December 31, 1925, and passengers would be able to ride between the ends of New York City on one fare. The lines were designed to compete with the IRT and BMT.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Subway Routes Adopted by City |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1923/08/04/archives/two-subway-routes-adopted-by-city-estimate-board-accepts-wash.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 4, 1923 |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plans Now Ready to Start Subways |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1924/03/12/archives/plans-now-ready-to-start-subways-commission-notifies-city-it-can.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 12, 1924 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, a loop subway service was planned to be built to [[New Jersey]].<ref name=\"nycsubway to nj\">nycsubway.org\u2014[http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Extensive_Rapid_Transit_Plan_Proposed_for_North_Jersey_(1926-1927) Extensive Rapid Transit Plan Proposed for North Jersey (1926-1927)]</ref>\n\nThe most grandiose plan, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated IND. By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included. As this grandiose expansion was not built, the subway system is only 70% of what it was planned to be. Magnificently engineered, almost entirely underground, with {{convert|670|ft|m}} platforms and [[flying junction]]s throughout, the IND system tripled the city's rapid transit debt, ironically contributing to the demise of [[Proposed New York City Subway expansion|plans for an ambitious expansion]] proposed before the first line of the first system was even opened.\n\nBecause of this debt, after the IND Sixth Avenue Line was completed, only 28 new stations were built. Five stations were on the abandoned [[New York, Westchester and Boston Railway|NYW&B]]-operated [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]], fourteen stations were on the abandoned LIRR [[Rockaway Beach Branch]] (now the [[IND Rockaway Line]]), six were on the [[Archer Avenue Lines]] and [[63rd Street Lines]] (built as part of a 1968 plan), two stations ([[57th Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|57th Street]] and [[Grand Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Grand Street]]) were part of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]], and the [[Harlem\u2013148th Street (IRT Lenox Avenue Line)|Harlem\u2013148th Street]] terminal. Four [[MTA Capital Construction]]-funded stations (the [[34th Street (IRT Flushing Line)|34th Street]] station on the [[7 Subway Extension]] and the three stations on the [[Second Avenue Subway]]) have been constructed with up to 14 more planned. However, the four MTA Capital Construction stations cost {{US$|6 billion|link=yes}}, reflecting the scale of the debt that the IND brought the city into.\n\n==Unification{{Anchor|Unification and contraction}}==\n[[File:Second Avenue El - demolition.jpg|thumb|left|The [[IRT Second Avenue Line]], being demolished shortly after unification]]\nIn June 1940, the transportation assets of the former BMT and IRT systems were taken over by the City of New York for operation by the city's Board of Transportation, which already operated the IND system.<ref name=\"nyct facts\"/> In June 1953, the New York City Transit Authority, a state agency incorporated for the benefit of the city, now known to the public as ''MTA New York City Transit'', succeeded the BoT.<ref name=\"nyct facts\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffhist.htm|title=New York City Transit - History and Chronology|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|work=mta.info|access-date=May 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffhist.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021019203759/http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffhist.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2002|title=About NYC Transit - History|last=|first=|date=October 19, 2002|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> A combination of factors had this takeover coincide with the end of the major rapid transit building eras in New York City.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://getpocket.com/explore/item/why-new-york-city-stopped-building-subways|title=Why New York City Stopped Building Subways - CityLab|last=English|first=Jonathan|date=April 16, 2018|website=Pocket|access-date=2019-05-13|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The city immediately began to eliminate what it considered redundancy in the system, closing several elevated lines including the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mta.info/news/2011/10/26/remembering-9th-avenue-el |title=Remembering the 9th Avenue El |work=MTA.info |date=October 26, 2011 |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref> and most of the [[IRT Second Avenue Line]] in Manhattan,<ref name=\"second avenue line\" /> and the [[BMT Fifth Avenue Line|BMT Fifth]] and [[BMT Third Avenue Line|Third Avenue Lines]] and most of the [[BMT Fulton Street Line]]<ref>B.M.T.

A Division cars can travel on B Division lines when necessary but are not used for passenger service on those lines because of the dangerously wide gap between the car and the station platform. This stems from the IRT and BRT's disagreement during the early days of the subway, where the BRT built cars that were purposefully too wide for the IRT.<ref name=\"diehl\">{{cite book |title=The Tracks that Built New York City |author=Diehl, Lorraine |year=2004 |location=New York |isbn=9781400052271 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/subwaystrackstha0000dieh }}</ref>\n\n[[File:NYC Subway Car 1950s.png|thumb|right|The interior of an IRT Third Avenue Line car before the line's demolition in the 1950s.]]\n\nThe original IRT subway lines (those built before the Dual Contracts) were built to modified elevated line dimensions. Whereas the IRT lines were originally equipped with cars that were {{convert|47|ft|m}} long, the cars designed for the IRT subway measure {{convert|51.3|ft|m}} long. Both sets of lines did not permit cars wider than {{convert|9|ft|m}}. The clearances and curves on these lines are too narrow and too sharp for any IND or BMT equipment. The later extensions of the IRT, constituting the bulk of the IRT system, were built to wider dimensions, and so are of a profile that could support the use of IND/BMT sized equipment.  In other words, B Division equipment could operate on much of A Division if station platforms were trimmed and trackside furniture moved, thus letting A Division service carry more passengers. However, there is virtually no chance of this happening because the older, narrower portions of A Division are centrally situated, such that it would be impossible to put together coherent through services. The most that can be reasonably hoped for is that some branch lines of Division A might be resized and attached to B Division lines.

The outsourcing of subway operations to the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] was favored at one point. On June 15, 1953, the NYCTA was founded with the aim of ensuring a cost-covering and efficient operation in the subways.<ref name=\"diehl\" />\n\nThere was a need to overhaul rolling stock and infrastructure of the once-private routes, especially for the IRT, where nearly all of the infrastructure was aged. The oldest cars came there from the time the subway opened in 1904, and the oldest subway cars of BMT in 1953 dated from the system's first years, in 1913. Therefore, a total of 2,860 cars for the A Division were delivered between 1948 and 1965, which constituted the replacement of almost the entire prewar IRT fleet. On the B Division, 2,760 cars were ordered. Platforms were doubled in length systemwide. At some stations, [[gap filler]]s were installed because the station extensions were curved. Also in this period, the BMT replaced their signals. The [[R36 (New York City Subway car)|Main Line R36]] cars were the first equipment to be equipped with two-way radio as delivered standard equipment in 1965, with the first use of radio in the subway system on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] in May 1965, and the  first successful air conditioned train ([[R38 (New York City Subway car)|R38]]) was placed into service July 19, 1967.<ref>\"New York City Transit Authority: Facts & Figures 1979\", New York City Transit Authority, 1979., pg. 17 (PDF) http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/WAGNER_FILES/06.021.0058.060284.11.PDF</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]] initiated a program to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car trains. The first contract, which was completed on August 8, 1946, extended the platforms at 125th Street, 207th Street, 215th Street, 225th Street, 231st Street and 238th Street on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] for $423,000. Additional platform extensions were completed on the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue LIne on October 18, 1946. On this date the platform extensions at 103rd Street, 110th Street, 116th Street, 137th Street, 145th Street, 157th Street, 168th Street, 181st Street, 191st Street and Dyckman Street were completed. This project cost $3.891 million. The platform extensions at the Hoyt Street station on the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]] opened on November 15, 1946, being completed for $733,200. Stations along the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] were next to receive the improvements. On January 24, 1947, the 23rd Street, 28th Street and 33rd Street platform extensions were completed, costing $4.003 million. Work was subsequently completed at the Bleecker Street and Spring Street stations for $1.97 million. The $1.992 million contract to lengthen the platforms at the Canal Street and Worth Street stations to the south was completed on April 26, 1947. On September 4, 1947, a contract extending the platforms for stations in the Bronx was completed. The first stage of the plan was completed on June 13, 1949, lengthening the platforms at Prospect Avenue, Jackson Avenue, Intervale Avenue, Simpson Street, Freeman Avenue, 174th Street and 177th Street on the IRT White Plains Road Line for $315,000. On September 14, 1949, the Chairman of the Board of Transportation, William Reid, announced that the program to lengthen 32 IRT stations had been completed for $13.327 million. Reid also announced that the Board had created a five-year plan to lengthen all remaining BMT and IRT stations to accommodate ten-car trains.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/09/15/archives/platforms-added-at-32-irt-stations-city-pays-out-13327000-in.html|title=PLATFORMS ADDED AT 32 IRT STATIONS; City Pays Out $13,327,000 in Lengthening Local Stops to Take 10-Car Trains|last=Crowell|first=Paul|date=September 15, 1949|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 4, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nostalgia Train (8892011318).jpg|thumb|right|An [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] train on the [[IND Rockaway Line]], opened in 1956 as one of two major expansions of the system in the mid-20th century]]\nOnly two new lines were opened in this era,<ref name=\":2\" /> the [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]] in 1941<ref name=\":8\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/05/16/archives/rail-line-is-added-to-subway-system-old-westchester-and-boston-road.html|title=Rail Line is Added to Subway System|date=May 16, 1941|page=25|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}</ref> and the [[IND Rockaway Line]] in 1956,<ref name=\"NYTimes-INDRkwyOpen-19562\">{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/06/28/84703811.pdf|title=Rockaway Trains to Operate Today|date=June 28, 1956|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|last1=Freeman|first1=Ira Henry|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Rockawave-INDRkwyOpen-June281956\">{{cite news|title=First Train On Rockaway Line Runs This Afternoon|date=June 28, 1956|work=[[Wave of Long Island]]|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|pages=[http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2520-%25200350.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F43c772ea5053ba7a2fe1850240ed52cd#page=1 1], [http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2FRockaway%2520Beach%2520NY%2520%2520Wave%2520Of%2520Long%2520Island%2520%25201956%2520-%25200355.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F6b6ee609a1895c1f89ff0c622e5b3813#page=1 6]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252023%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%25201955-1957%2FForest%2520Parkway%2520NY%2520Leader%2520Observer%25201955-1957%2520-%25200650.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F8150b004ade0565d32aa4d88b21d2892#page=1|title=TA's New Line To Rockaways Begins Today: Fifty Piece Band To Play as Special Train Makes First Run|date=June 28, 1956|work=The Leader-Observer|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|page=1|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/viewer/?file=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252023%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Greenpoint%2520Daily%2520Star%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Greenpoint%2520Daily%2520Star%25201956-1957%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Greenpoint%2520Daily%2520Star%25201956-1957%2520-%25200241.pdf&highlightsFile=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2Fhighlighter%2Fhits%2F147cd4c4e78bb11637387bbb8e8e3a06#page=1|title=To Rockaways: Beach Trains In Operation|date=June 29, 1956|work=Greenpoint Weekly Star|agency=[[Fultonhistory.com]]|page=2|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> with an extension of the latter to [[Far Rockaway\u2013Mott Avenue (IND Rockaway Line)|Far Rockaway\u2013Mott Avenue]] in 1958.<ref name=\"NYTImes-FarRkwyIND-Open-1958\">{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/01/16/83388071.pdf|title=New Subway Unit Ready: Far Rockaway IND Terminal Will Be Opened Today|date=January 16, 1958|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Both of these lines were rehabilitations of existing railroad rights-of-way rather than new construction.

In 1951 a half-billion dollar bond issue was passed to build the [[Second Avenue Subway]], but money from this issue was used for other priorities and the building of short connector lines, namely a ramp extending the [[IND Culver Line]] over the ex-BMT Culver Line at Ditmas and McDonald Avenues in Brooklyn (1954), allowing IND subway service to operate to [[Coney Island]] for the first time,<ref name=\":2\" /> the [[60th Street Tunnel Connection]] (1955), linking the [[BMT Broadway Line]] to the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]],<ref name=\":2\" /> and the [[Chrystie Street Connection]] (1967), linking the BMT line via the [[Manhattan Bridge]] to the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejoekorner.com/bdtrans-51/bd-trans-51-plan-indx.html |title=Board of Transportation - 1951 |publisher=Thejoekorner.com |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy January 1955, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] and the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] could theoretically raise $1.25 billion effective immediately ({{inflation|r=-6|fmt=eq|US|1,250,000,000|1955}}). In his 1974 book ''[[The Power Broker]]'', [[Robert Caro|Robert A. Caro]] estimated that this amount of money could modernize both the [[Long Island Rail Road]] for $700 million and the [[PATH (rail system)|Hudson & Manhattan Railroad]] for $500 million, with money left over to build the [[Second Avenue Subway]] as well as [[Proposed expansion of the New York City Subway#1954|proposed extensions]] of subway lines in Queens and Brooklyn.<ref name=\"Caro1974\">{{Cite Power Broker}}</ref>{{Rp|928\u2013929}} However, [[Robert Moses]], the city's chief urban planner at the time, did not allow funding for most mass transit expansions in the New York City area,<ref name=\"Caro1974\" />{{Rp|930\u2013933}} instead building highways and parkways without any provisions for mass transit lines in the future.<ref name=\"Caro1974\" />{{Rp|939\u2013958}} Caro noted that the lack of attention to mass transit expansions and routine maintenance contributed to the decline of the subway: \"When Robert Moses came to power in New York in 1934, the city's mass transportation system was probably the best in the world. When he left power in 1968 it was quite possibly the worst.\"<ref name=\"Caro1974\" />{{Rp|933}}\n\nSoon after, the city entered a fiscal crisis. Closures of elevated lines continued. These closures included the entire [[IRT Third Avenue Line]] in Manhattan (1955) and the Bronx (1973), as well as the [[BMT Lexington Avenue Line]] (1950), much of the remainder of the [[BMT Fulton Street Line]] (1956), the downtown Brooklyn part of the [[BMT Myrtle Avenue Line]] (1969), and the [[BMT Culver Shuttle]] (1975), all in [[Brooklyn]], and the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] in [[Queens]] starting in 1977.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> The [[BMT Archer Avenue Line]] was supposed to replace the BMT Jamaica Line's eastern end, but it was never completed to its full extent, and opened in 1988 as a stub-end line, terminating at Jamaica Center.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:BROOKLYN'S BUSHWICK AVENUE SEEN FROM AN ELEVATED TRAIN PLATFORM IN NEW YORK CITY.

Pictured is the remaining portion in 1974]]\n\nIn addition, construction and maintenance of existing lines was deferred, and graffiti and crime were very common. Trains frequently broke down, were poorly maintained, and were often late, while ridership declined by the millions each year. As in all of the city, crime was rampant in the subway in the 1970s. Thefts, robberies, shootings and killings became more frequent. The rolling stock was very often graffiti-painted or vandalism-damaged both inside and outside. As the [[New York City Police Department]] was completely overwhelmed, the public reacted with unease, and the subway was deliberately avoided. Around 1980, the reliability of the vehicles was a tenth of their reliability in the 1960s, and 40 percent of the network required speed restrictions. Because there had been no further studies of the subway since 1975, one third of the fleet was out of use during rush hours due to serious technical defects. In addition, signs were fitted incorrectly, and spare parts were missing or were bought in too large quantities, could not be found, or could not be installed due to lack of repairmen.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n\nThe New York City Subway tried to keep its budget balanced between spending and revenue, so deferred maintenance became more common, which drew a slow but steady decline of the system and rolling stock. Furthermore, the workers were consolidated into the [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union]] in 1968. A pension was set up, and workers were allowed to retire after 20 years of service without any transitional period. About a third of the most highly experienced staff immediately retired, resulting in a large shortage of skilled workers.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n\nOnly in the 1980s did an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway start. Between 1985 and 1991 over 3,000 subway cars were overhauled and fitted with [[air conditioning]]. In this way, comfort, reliability and durability would be increased in order to postpone new purchases. The TA only replaced the oldest cars each division, so that despite the fact that the fleet was overaged, the TA bought only 1,350 new vehicles. Increased patrols and fences around the train yards offered better protection against graffiti and vandalism.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> At the same time, the TA began an extensive renovation of the routes. Within ten years the tracks were thereby renewed almost systemwide. The Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge, which had strong corrosion damage, were refurbished over the years. The renovation of the stations was initially limited to security measures, fresh paint, new lighting and signs, but the TA also tried to improve the service that had been neglected. This ranged from new uniforms and training for the staff to correct destination signs on the rolling stock. Some [[List of New York City Subway services|subway services]] were also adapted to the changing needs of customers.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> Another stated goal was to reduce crime or at least an improvement in the subjective sense of security. At night, the railway police and members of the citizens' initiative [[Guardian Angels]], formed in 1979, patrolled in the subway trains.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> It was not until the 1990s that the crime in the city and its subway declined significantly.\n\n=== Late 1950s and early 1960s ===\nIn 1956, the NYCTA chairman, Charles Patterson, proposed removing the seats from the trains on the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] to increase the passenger load.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/01/25/86510389.pdf|title=Seatless I.R.T.

Some lines had service run as infrequently as 30 minutes. Also on this date, BMT express service was extended to 57th Street from 42nd Street. Earlier in 1957, local service on the BMT Jamaica Line was extended to Crescent Street from Eastern Parkway, and rush hour service was increased to run every 5 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Annual Report For The Year Ended June 30, 1957|last=|first=|date=October 1957|website=|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|page=9|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUnder a $100 million rebuilding program, increased and lengthened service was implemented during peak hours on the '''1''' train. Switching at a junction north of 96th Street, delayed service as trains from the Lenox Avenue Line which ran local switched from the express to the local, while trains from the Broadway Branch that ran express switched from the local to the express. This bottleneck was removed on February 6, 1959. All Broadway trains were locals, and all Lenox Avenue trains were expresses, eliminating the need to switch tracks. All '''3''' trains began to run express south of 96th Street on that date running to Brooklyn. '''1''' trains began to run between 242nd Street and South Ferry all times.

In January 1977, to both save money and increase safety, subway trains were shortened during off hours. By October 1977, a planned Metropolitan Transportation Center at Third Avenue and 48th Street was dropped. LIRR trains using the 63rd Street tunnel would run to Grand Central, whenever that line would be built. $63 million had been spent on [[Second Avenue Subway]] construction through December 1978, even though subway construction only consisted of three short segments of tunnel when it was halted in April 1975. Ridership kept dropping rapidly; it dropped by 25 million passengers between June 30, 1976, and June 30, 1977, and within a span of eight years, 327 million passengers stopped using the subway. Some estimated that if this rate of decline were to continue, there would be no passengers on the system by 2002.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nAs a result of declining ridership, the number of subway cars used during the morning rush hours dropped from 5,557 in 1974 to about 4,900 in 1978. Headways were increased, too, so people were waiting longer periods of time for shorter trains that were intensely crowded. Headways on the A, D, N and RR services were 5 minutes during rush hours (or 12 trains per hour) in 1978; they were 4 minutes (or 15 trains per hour) in 1974.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/08/14/archives/215-more-daily-subway-runs-will-be-eliminated-by-aug-30-215-more.html|title=215 More Daily Subway Runs Will Be Eliminated by Aug. 30|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=August 14, 1976|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=New York Times Archive}}</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1975, the NYCTA announced that in September of that year 94 daily IRT trips would be discontinued, accounting for 4 percent of then-existing service on the IRT.

Express service on the 7 was to be discontinued between the hours of 9:30&nbsp;a.m. and 3:30&nbsp;p.m. and was to be replaced by more frequent local service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E5D9123BEE34BC4051DFB366838E669EDE&legacy=true|title=4 Per Cent Cut in IRT Subway Service Scheduled for September|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=May 28, 1975|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=New York Times Archive}}</ref> Also, during the same month, the NYCTA was considering making the A train a local at all times except rush hours, when it would remain an express.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9505E2DA133CE034BC4E51DFB366838E669EDE&legacy=true|title=The A Train, a Loser, May Cut Express Runs|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=May 26, 1975|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=New York Times Archive}}</ref>\n\nOn December 17, 1975, the MTA announced that a 4.4 percent cutback of rush hour train service would take place on January 18, 1976. The cutbacks, the third of the year, trimmed 279 train runs from the previous 6,900. Service was most drastically reduced on the Lexington Avenue Line, with seven fewer express trains during the morning rush hour heading southbound. The cuts were the first of a three-phase program that was put in effect between January and July 1976. The cuts permitted a savings of $12.6 million a year for the NYCTA, which had an increasing deficit. Other subway services were changed or discontinued as part of the plan. On January 19, F trains were planned to stop running express in Brooklyn, and the GG was to be cut back to [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]]. In April it was planned that all rush hour 1 trains would begin running to [[Van Cortlandt Park\u2013242nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|242nd Street]]; these runs had previously terminated at [[137th Street\u2013City College (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|137th Street]]. During midday hours, trains on the 1 were to be shortened to five cars. In July, it was planned that the EE would be discontinued; N trains were to have been extended to Continental Avenue via the Queens Boulevard Line to replace it. Manhattan-bound N trains were to continue running express, while in the opposite direction they would run local. N trains would alternate between terminating at Whitehall Street or Coney Island during rush hours. CC trains, in July, were planned to be extended from Hudson Terminal to Rockaway Park replacing the E, which was to have been cut back to Hudson Terminal. The K was planned to be discontinued in July.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/18/archives/subways-to-trim-service-in-rush-hours-on-jan-18-subways-to-drop-279.html|title=Subways to Trim Service In Rush Hours on Jan. 18|last=Burks|first=Edward C.|date=December 18, 1975|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=New York Times Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe changes that were supposed to take place in July instead took effect on August 30. 215 more runs were eliminated on that date.

The cuts, planned to take effect in January 1977, would have eliminated service on the Bowling Green\u2013South Ferry Shuttle, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and AA service, which was to be replaced by the A during late nights. GG service would be cut back to Queens Plaza during late evenings and late nights. B and N service would have been cut back to shuttles, running between 36th Street and Coney Island on their respective lines. It was also proposed that during off-peak hours 10-car trains would be cut to eight, six or four car trains.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=990CE3DE133FE334BC4D52DFB467838D669EDE&legacy=true|title=$30 Million Cuts Proposed to Meet New York Transit Agency Shortage; Plan Emphasizes Curbs on Off-Hour Service Control Board Asked $42 Million Trim $30 MILLION IN CUTS IN TRANSIT PROPOSED|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=December 15, 1976|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=New York Times Archive}}</ref>\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:N approaching 6 Av in BR trench jeh.JPG|left|thumb|The [[BMT Sea Beach Line]].

About 85.8% of trains were on schedule in 1970, with 1,142 equipment-related delays in April 1970.<ref name=\"nym 19700623\"/> However, issues such as broken lights, fans, and signs; defective doors, wheels, and brakes; and subway cars that often became uncoupled or \"pulled apart\", were still prevalent. One out of three IRT stations did not have running water in case of emergency. In addition, the system's staff were leaving in massive numbers, with 5,655 workers having retired or quit from early 1969 to mid-1970.<ref name=\"nym 19700623\"/>\n\nIn the late 1970s, hundreds of slow speed orders were found throughout the system due to the risk of derailments. Graffiti covered every single subway car in the system, and the number of available cars for rush hour services continued to drop, from 5,557 in 1976, then to 5,025 in 1977, and finally to 4,900 in May 1978. Mean Distance Between Failures (MDBF) rates were at all time lows, as the MDBF rate system-wide was 6,000 miles by 1980. Maintenance on rolling stock was so bad that by 1979, 200 retired [[R16 (New York City Subway car)|R16]] cars were put back into service to replace the newest rolling stock in the system, the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]]. Most R46s had cracked trucks, and were only allowed to operate during rush hours as they were sent for rehabilitation.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nAt the height of the transit crisis in 1983, on-time performance dropped below 50%.<ref name=\"CapitalProgram\">{{cite web|url=http://wagner.nyu.edu/files/news/rescue.pdf|title=From Rescue to Renaissance: The Achievements of the MTA Capital Program 1982 - 2004|last2=de Cerre\u00f1o|first2=Allison L.

The worst subway station overall, in terms of crime and its condition, was [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street (New York City Subway)|Grand Central\u201342nd Street]], while the worst elevated station was [[Metropolitan Avenue (BMT Myrtle Avenue Line)|Metropolitan Avenue]] in Queens. The subway cars in the worst condition were the [[R10 (New York City Subway car)|R10s]]. The subway line with the worst signals was the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]], so the signals were upgraded in the 1980s. The track in the worst shape was that of the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]], which had more or less the same infrastructure as when it opened in 1915.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n\nEven with the addition of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, less than half of the $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It had to do this with a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime was out of control, and for a while it was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nDue to deferred maintenance, the condition of the subway system reached dangerous conditions in the early 1980s; new construction was, by then, considered ludicrous. Even as the only new construction was going on in the 63rd Street Line, Manhattan residents at the vicinity of York Avenue and East 63rd Street protested over the MTA's intention to build a ventilation shaft for the line. During the early 1980s, work on the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue lines continued, although the MTA considered stopping work on these projects in October 1980, and spending the money instead on maintaining the existing system.\n\nStructural defects were found in elevated structures systemwide and on the [[Manhattan Bridge|Manhattan]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge|Williamsburg]] Bridges, causing frequent closures or delays on many subway lines during the 1980s. Reroutes from both bridges were necessitated; while the Manhattan Bridge, between 1986 and 2004, had two of its four tracks closed at a time for construction, the Williamsburg Bridge needed a shutdown from April to June 1988 for emergency structural repairs to be made.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> Federal funding for the repair of the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] was deferred throughout the 1980s due to the extremely bad state of the Williamsburg Bridge. On the bridge, pigeon droppings corroded the bridge's steel, broken cable strands suspending the bridge numbered over 200, and concrete in the bridge began to come off and leave large holes.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nDue to low ridership and the increasing shabbiness of the subway, parts or most of several lines\u2014the [[BMT Canarsie Line]]; the [[IND Crosstown Line]]; either the [[IND Concourse Line]] or the [[IRT Jerome Avenue Line]] north of [[161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium (New York City Subway)|161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium]]; and the BMT Jamaica Line east of either [[Broadway Junction (BMT Jamaica Line)|Broadway Junction]] or [[Cypress Hills (BMT Jamaica Line)|Cypress Hills]]\u2014were proposed for closure and abandonment in 1981. Other lines proposed for closure included the remaining part of the [[IND Culver Line]], the [[BMT West End Line]], the [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]], part of the [[IND Rockaway Line]], part of the [[IRT White Plains Road Line]], and the remaining part of the [[BMT Myrtle Avenue Line]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/30/nyregion/calls-for-subway-service-cuts-rise-as-system-continues-to-limp-along.html|title=Calls for Subway Service Cuts Rise as System Continues to Limp Along|last=Goldman|first=Ari L.|date=1981-12-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In fact, the eastern part of the BMT Jamaica Line was actually demolished, mainly as part of the Program for Action, but also due to low ridership.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/> Officials also proposed shutting the subway at night between midnight and 6 a.m. in order to reduce crime.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/16/nyregion/6-hour-nightly-shutdown-of-subways-is-proposed.html|title=6-Hour Nightly Shutdown of Subways Is Proposed|last=Cummings|first=Judith|date=1981-07-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Off-peak train trips, as well as trips on the branches outside the city's core, were reduced sharply.<ref>{{cite web | title=Subway Service Shuffled to Cope In Repair 'Crisis'; Off-Peak Runs Will Be Cut for a Rush-Hour Reserve 'This Program Will Be Painful' Trouble-Shooters Added Subway Service Shuffled to Cope in a Repair 'Crisis' | work=The New York Times | date=November 5, 1980 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/05/112168722.pdf | access-date=February 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, operation on the New York City Subway was so bad that:<ref>\"Plan to put new cops on train patrol,\" ''Daily News'' (New York), January 28, 1982, page 23.</ref><ref>\"Source for all the bullets: Can We Save Our Subways,\" ''Daily News'' (New York), January 25, 1981, page 7.</ref>\n* In January 1981, there was one Tuesday where {{frac|1|3}} of the subway fleet was not in service.

Even thought they were the newest cars, they had a variety of problems. The R46s broke down the most and had cracked trucks, while the R44s had issues because of the sophisticated technology that was installed in anticipation of operating on a fully automated [[IND Second Avenue Line]].<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1980s\"/>\n\nIn 1986, the MTA and [[Regional Plan Association]] again considered closing {{Convert|26|mi|km}} of above-ground lines to follow population shifts.

There were other rampant crimes as well, so that two hundred were arrested for possible subway crimes in the first two weeks of December 1977, under an operation dubbed \"Subway Sweep\". Passengers were afraid of the subway because of its crime, angry over long waits for trains that were shortened to save money, and upset over the general malfunctioning of the system. The subway also had many dark subway cars.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> Further compounding the issue, on July 13, 1977, a [[New York City blackout of 1977|blackout]] cut off electricity to most of the city and to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]].<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/> Due to a sudden increase of violent crimes on the subway in the last week of 1978, police statistics about crime in the subway were being questioned.

Arrests weren't the only way to combat evasions, and by the early 1990s NYCTA was examining methods to improve fare control passenger throughputs, reduce fare collection costs, and maintain control over evasions and general grime. The AFC system was being designed, and evasion-preventing capability was a key consideration.\n\nTA's queuing studies concluded that purchasing tokens from clerks was not efficient. Preventing '[[Slug (coin)|slug]]' use required sophisticated measures like tokens with metal alloy centers and electronic [[token coin|token]] verification devices. To provide better access control, the NYCTA experimented with floor-to-ceiling gates and \u201chigh wheel\u201d turnstiles.

It stated: \"Almost all of the projects are well ahead of the goal recommended five years ago. Despite technical setbacks, legal roadblocks, administrative frustrations and limited funding, progress has been substantial.\" Other improvements, not stated in the report, were also being done. As of 1973, progress had been made on several projects, the first six of which were Program for Action projects:\n* The [[63rd Street Tunnel]] was completed and outfitting for the new lines that were to run through it was to begin in early 1974.\n* Three new subway lines were under construction (63rd Street, Second Avenue, and Archer Avenue Lines).\n* Eight new subway lines were under design.\n* Two underground crosstown people-movers were being studied.\n* Rolling stock ordered during these years had a common front end, with a silver finish with a blue stripe along the side:\n** 800 new [[R40 (New York City Subway car)|R40]] and [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] subway cars were placed into service. In 1968, 27% of the fleet was considered to be beyond retirement age (which was said to be 30 years if a subway car is properly maintained); in 1973, this was halved to about 14%. In 1968, there were 6,975 subway cars in the fleet, of which 1,883 were beyond their useful lives; by 1973, there were 6,826 cars in the fleet, of which 956 were beyond their useful lives.\n** The first 8-car train of [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]] was placed into revenue service on December 16, 1971, on a one-month trial. The first train of R44s in \"permanent\" revenue service left 179th Street - Jamaica on the {{NYCS|F}} train on April 19, 1972. By 1973, 300 R44s were placed in service and 745 [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]] subway cars were ordered from Pullman Standard (and this number would increase slightly to 754 cars). The first four R46 cars would be delivered on March 27, 1975, and would be tested on the express tracks of the Sea Beach Line. The first R46 train went into revenue service on July 14, 1975.\n* [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] modernization and expansion. This project started on July 19, 1972, to relieve overcrowding as a result of new office development in the area.\n* [[49th Street (BMT Broadway Line)|49th Street]] modernization, to be completed in 1974.\n* [[50th Street (IRT Broadway \u2013 Seventh Avenue Line)|50th Street]] station design, to be completed in late 1973.\n* 50 BMT stations had their platforms extended (or were currently being extended) to accommodate 600-foot trains.\n* 200 new token booths were deployed with another 300 planned.\n* 980 new on-train radios were installed aboard subway cars that did not previously have them.\n* Projects to figure out how to air condition IRT cars were started. Two IRT cars completed a two-year air conditioning test on September 5, 1973, and the first two 10-car IRT trains retrofitted with air conditioning entered service on June 24, 1975.\n\nIn April 1974, the City approved emergency appropriations to fix the following problems:\n* Rebuilding a collapsing section of a retaining wall on the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]] between [[Fort Hamilton Parkway (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Fort Hamilton Parkway]] and [[New Utrecht Avenue (BMT Sea Beach Line)|New Utrecht Avenue]]. At times, trains were rerouted to the express tracks to avoid vibrations in the area.\n* Reinstall cable in the [[Steinway Tunnel]] that was temporarily shored up when a duct fell on a Flushing-bound IRT train\n* Fix a sinking pier on a trestle near [[Broad Channel (IND Rockaway Line)|Broad Channel]] on the [[IND Rockaway Line]]\n\nA $3.5 billion bond issue, declined on November 6, 1973, would have financed the following subway improvements:\n* Extension of the [[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]] to [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]]\n* Building the long-proposed [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] to [[Springfield Boulevard]]\n* Building [[Lower Manhattan \u2013 Jamaica / JFK Transportation Project|joint LIRR/subway extensions]] from the [[Atlantic Terminal (LIRR station)|Atlantic Avenue]] LIRR terminal to [[lower Manhattan]]\n* Building a two-track subway off the IND Queens Boulevard Line under the [[Long Island Expressway]] to [[Kissena Boulevard]] and [[Queens College]]\n* Another branch off the IND Queens Boulevard Line at 63rd Drive to the [[IND Rockaway Line]]\n\nEven through the late 1970s, there were improvement plans, many of which were implemented.<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n* [[Closed circuit television]] in the [[Times Square\u201342nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal (New York City Subway)|Times Square\u201342nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal]] station complex\n* New lighting on the [[BMT Brighton Line]] south of [[Newkirk Avenue (BMT Brighton Line)|Newkirk Avenue]]\n* A new escalator at [[Brighton Beach (BMT Brighton Line)|Brighton Beach]]\n* New escalators at [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]]\n* Signal improvements on the eastern end of the [[IRT New Lots Line]]\n\nA grant consisting of $27 million in federal funds in October 1978 enabled the following improvements:<ref name=\"nyc subway in the 1970s\"/>\n* Repairing roof canopies of ten [[IND Culver Line]] stations\n* Conversion of 15 escalators to automatic operation in various stations\n* Rehabilitation of other Manhattan escalators and those at [[Smith\u2013Ninth Streets (IND Culver Line)|Smith\u2013Ninth Streets]] in Brooklyn\n* Replacement of [[third rail]] on the [[IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] between [[168th Street (IRT Broadway \u2013 Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street]] and [[Dyckman Street (IRT Broadway \u2013 Seventh Avenue Line)|Dyckman Street]] in Manhattan\n\nTransit improvements planned for 1979 included:<ref name=\"nycsubway.org\"/>\n* Welded rail along the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] between [[Jay Street \u2013 MetroTech (IND Lines)|Jay Street]] and Worth Street\n* 40 [[closed circuit television]] monitors at [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (New York City Subway)|Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue]]\n* Power substation renovations to the substations at Flatbush Avenue and Empire Blvd, and Joralemon Street and Willow Place.\n* A new car wash facility in [[Coney Island Yard]]\n* Canopy replacement along [[BMT West End Line]] and [[BMT Brighton Line]] stations\n* New signage on 2,496 IRT cars\n[[File:Marcy Avenue -

The cars would be purchased using $190 million from the Transportation Bond Act voters approved in November 1979. Advantages of the car were the same as in the R44 and R46 orders\u2014fewer subway cars of longer length can make up a 510-foot train and reducing operating and maintenance costs; however, drawbacks identified for these cars included not lining up with the movable platforms at [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (New York City Subway)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]], and not fitting tight curves, such as at [[South Ferry loops (New York City Subway)|South Ferry]]. After paying consultant Louis T.

Bombardier ended up winning the contract for the [[R62A (New York City Subway car)|R62As]].\n\nIn October 1982, a consortium of French engineering companies was selected by the MTA to build 225 subway cars, which became known as the [[R68 (New York City Subway car)|R68s]]. The consortium was chosen over bids from the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Sumitomo Group]]. The first regular R68 train went into revenue service in Brighton Beach on June 20, 1986, after passing a successful 30-day test. Two hundred option-1 cars were later delivered for a total of 425 cars. The option for 200 additional R68s was given to Kawasaki and the car class became known as the [[R68A (New York City Subway car)|R68A]]. The first R68A cars were delivered to New York City on April 12, 1988, and transferred to the MTA the following day. The first train of R68As began a 30-day acceptance test on May 18, 1988, on the [[IND Concourse Line]].\n\nThe [[R10 (New York City Subway car)|R10]], [[R14 (New York City Subway car)|R14]], [[R16 (New York City Subway car)|R16]], [[R17 (New York City Subway car)|R17]], [[R21 (New York City Subway car)|R21]], and [[R22 (New York City Subway car)|R22]] car classes all were retired with the deliveries of the R62/As and R68/As.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Revitalization and recent history==\n\n=== 1990s ===\nSubway ridership increased through the 1990s.

Commissioned as ''His Majesty's [[Barque|Bark]] Endeavour'', she departed [[Plymouth]] in August 1768, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the islands of [[Huahine]], [[Bora Bora]], and [[Raiatea]] west of Tahiti to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to reach the islands since [[Abel Tasman]]'s ''Heemskerck'' 127 years earlier.\n\nIn April 1770, ''Endeavour'' became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia, with Cook going ashore at what is now known as [[Botany Bay]]. ''Endeavour'' then sailed north along the Australian coast next stopping at the now-town of Seventeen Seventy/Agnes Water in late May 1770. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. ''Endeavour'' was beached on the Australian mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. Resuming her voyage, she limped into port in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in October 1770, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands that they had visited. From Batavia ''Endeavour'' continued westward, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771 and reached the English port of [[Dover]] on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.\n\nThe ship was largely forgotten after her epic Pacific voyage, spending the next three years hauling troops and cargo to and from the [[Falkland Islands]]. She was renamed '''''Lord Sandwich''''' in 1775 after being sold into private hands, and used to transport timber from the Baltic. Rehired as a British troop transport during the [[American War of Independence]], she was finally [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in a blockade of [[Narragansett Bay]], [[Rhode Island]] in 1778. The wreck has not been precisely located but is thought to be one of a cluster of five in Newport Harbor. \n\nRelics from ''Endeavour'' are displayed at maritime museums worldwide, including an anchor and six of her cannons. A [[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|replica of ''Endeavour'']] was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in Sydney Harbour.  The US [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] was named after this ship, and she is depicted on the [[New Zealand fifty-cent coin]].\n\n==Construction==\n''Endeavour'' was originally the merchant collier ''Earl of Pembroke'', built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of [[Whitby]] in [[North Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"EncyclopediaNZ\" /> She was a type known locally as the ''Whitby Cat''. She was [[full rigged ship|ship-rigged]] and sturdily built with a broad, flat [[bow (ship)|bow]], a square [[stern]], and a long box-like body with a deep [[hold (ship)|hold]].<ref name=\"Hosty41\">Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 41</ref>\n\nA flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be [[Beach (nautical)|beached]] for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a [[dry dock]]. Her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], internal floors, and [[Futtock shrouds|futtocks]] were built from traditional [[white oak]], her [[keel]] and [[stern post]] from [[elm]], and her masts from [[pine]] and [[fir]].<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 19.</ref> Plans of the ship also show a double [[keelson]] to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 33\u201341</ref>\n\nSome doubt exists about the height of her standing masts (excludes top and gallant masts<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">National Maritime Museum Greenwich Endeavour 1771 draught ZAZ6595</ref>), as surviving diagrams of ''Endeavour'' depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan.<ref name=\"Marquardt\"/> While her main and foremast standing spars (excludes top and gallant masts<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>) are accepted to be a standard (standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Seamans Vade-Mecum and defensive war by sea, William Mountaine 1761</ref>) {{convert|69|and|65|ft}}, respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594 <ref>National Maritime Museum Greenwich</ref> which records these lengths has the mizzen as \"16&nbsp;yards 29&nbsp;inches\" ({{#expr:((16+(29/36))*0.9144)round1}}&nbsp;m).<ref name=\"Marquardt\"/> If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full {{convert|9|ft|m}} shorter than the standards of the day.<ref>Sutherland, Rushton, Cooper 1711</ref><ref>Davis and Edson 1985</ref> Late 20th-century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error with \"19&nbsp;yards&nbsp;29 inches\" ({{#expr:((19+(29/36))*0.9144)round1}}&nbsp;m) being the true reading, which would more closely conform with both the naval standards (which standard?<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>) and the lengths of the other masts.<ref name=\"Marquardt\">Marquardt 1995, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nA more recent critical review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst at the same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cook's Bark ''Endeavour'' along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark ''Endeavour'' spar measurements [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594,<ref>National Maritime Museum Endeavour 1771 draught ZAZ6594</ref> and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10&nbsp;ft above this as was sometimes done.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8\u2013 9&nbsp;ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5&nbsp;ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>) from the level of the water line.\n\nWhereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18&nbsp;ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS ''Endeavour'' off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 at the top of this page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844.<ref>National Maritime Museum Greenwich Endeavour 1768 as fitted draught ZAZ7844</ref>\n\nUsing these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught, it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of ''Endeavour'' support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.\n\nThe replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson, as is the model in the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich. There is a difference between the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of ''Earl of Pembroke'' before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts.\n\n==Purchase and refit by the Admiralty==\nOn 16 February 1768, the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the sun.<ref>Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 24</ref> Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or \"unknown southern land\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721065703/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |archivedate=21 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer [[Alexander Dalrymple]], whose acceptance was conditional on a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] commission as a captain in the Royal Navy.

The line then moves south and west to New Zealand, west to the Australian coast and north to Cape York.|An 1893 chart showing ''Endeavour''{{'s}} track]]\n\n===Shipwreck===\nFor the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11&nbsp;pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef,<ref name=\"Cook11June\">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 343\u2013345</ref> today called [[Endeavour Reef]], within the [[Great Barrier Reef]] system. The sails were immediately taken down, a [[Anchor#Kedging|kedging anchor]] set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef ''Endeavour'' had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to {{convert|70|ft}} less than one ship's length away.<ref name=\"Cook11June\"/>\n\nCook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out.<ref name=\"Cook11June\"/> The crew attached [[buoy]]s to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later,<ref name=\"Parkin317\">Parkin 2003, p. 317</ref> but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 313</ref>\n\nWhen, by Cook's reckoning, about {{convert|40|to|50|long ton|t}} of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free.<ref>Hough 1994, p. 179</ref> In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20&nbsp;pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off.<ref name=\"Cook12June\">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 345\u2013346</ref> The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.<ref name=\"Cook12June\"/>\n\nAs expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in [[Sounding line|sounding]] the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about {{convert|18|in|cm}} between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak.<ref name=\"Cook12June\"/>\n\nThe prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was {{convert|24|mi}} from shore<ref name=\"Courier1878\"/> and the three ship's boats could not carry the entire crew.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 311</ref> Despite this, Joseph Banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances.<ref>Blainey 2008, p. 236</ref>\n\nMidshipman Jonathon Monkhouse<!-- sometimes spelt Munkhouse, but Cook used \"Monkhouse\" in his journal. Brother of William Monkhouse, the gunner --> proposed [[fothering]] the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 321</ref> He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of [[oakum]] and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 322</ref>\n\n[[File:Endeavour at Endeavour River, engraving c. 1786.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=An old engraving shows the Endeavour beached on the shore of a bay, surrounded by wooded hills.

She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in ''Endeavour''.

Commissioned as ''His Majesty's [[Barque|Bark]] Endeavour'', she departed [[Plymouth]] in August 1768, rounded [[Cape Horn]] and reached [[Tahiti]] in time to observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the islands of [[Huahine]], [[Bora Bora]], and [[Raiatea]] west of Tahiti to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to reach the islands since [[Abel Tasman]]'s ''Heemskerck'' 127 years earlier.\n\nIn April 1770, ''Endeavour'' became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia, with Cook going ashore at what is now known as [[Botany Bay]]. ''Endeavour'' then sailed north along the Australian coast next stopping at the now-town of Seventeen Seventy/Agnes Water in late May 1770. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the [[Great Barrier Reef]], and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. ''Endeavour'' was beached on the Australian mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. Resuming her voyage, she limped into port in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in October 1770, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands that they had visited. From Batavia ''Endeavour'' continued westward, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 13 March 1771 and reached the English port of [[Dover]] on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.\n\nThe ship was largely forgotten after her epic Pacific voyage, spending the next three years hauling troops and cargo to and from the [[Falkland Islands]]. She was renamed '''''Lord Sandwich''''' in 1775 after being sold into private hands, and used to transport timber from the Baltic. Rehired as a British troop transport during the [[American War of Independence]], she was finally [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in a blockade of [[Narragansett Bay]], [[Rhode Island]] in 1778. The wreck has not been precisely located but is thought to be one of a cluster of five in Newport Harbor. \n\nRelics from ''Endeavour'' are displayed at maritime museums worldwide, including an anchor and six of her cannons. A [[HM Bark Endeavour Replica|replica of ''Endeavour'']] was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]] in Sydney Harbour.  The US [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] was named after this ship, and she is depicted on the [[New Zealand fifty-cent coin]].\n\n==Construction==\n''Endeavour'' was originally the merchant collier ''Earl of Pembroke'', built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of [[Whitby]] in [[North Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"EncyclopediaNZ\" /> She was a type known locally as the ''Whitby Cat''. She was [[full rigged ship|ship-rigged]] and sturdily built with a broad, flat [[bow (ship)|bow]], a square [[stern]], and a long box-like body with a deep [[hold (ship)|hold]].<ref name=\"Hosty41\">Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 41</ref>\n\nA flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be [[Beach (nautical)|beached]] for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a [[dry dock]]. Her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], internal floors, and [[Futtock shrouds|futtocks]] were built from traditional [[white oak]], her [[keel]] and [[stern post]] from [[elm]], and her masts from [[pine]] and [[fir]].<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, p. 19.</ref> Plans of the ship also show a double [[keelson]] to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.<ref>Hosty and Hundley 2003, pp. 33\u201341</ref>\n\nSome doubt exists about the height of her standing masts (excludes top and gallant masts<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">National Maritime Museum Greenwich Endeavour 1771 draught ZAZ6595</ref>), as surviving diagrams of ''Endeavour'' depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan.<ref name=\"Marquardt\"/> While her main and foremast standing spars (excludes top and gallant masts<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>) are accepted to be a standard (standards differed from shipyard to shipyard and country to country<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Seamans Vade-Mecum and defensive war by sea, William Mountaine 1761</ref>) {{convert|69|and|65|ft}}, respectively from an annotation on one surviving ship plan [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594 <ref>National Maritime Museum Greenwich</ref> which records these lengths has the mizzen as \"16&nbsp;yards 29&nbsp;inches\" ({{#expr:((16+(29/36))*0.9144)round1}}&nbsp;m).<ref name=\"Marquardt\"/> If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full {{convert|9|ft|m}} shorter than the standards of the day.<ref>Sutherland, Rushton, Cooper 1711</ref><ref>Davis and Edson 1985</ref> Late 20th-century research suggested the annotation may be a transcription error with \"19&nbsp;yards&nbsp;29 inches\" ({{#expr:((19+(29/36))*0.9144)round1}}&nbsp;m) being the true reading, which would more closely conform with both the naval standards (which standard?<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>) and the lengths of the other masts.<ref name=\"Marquardt\">Marquardt 1995, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nA more recent critical review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst at the same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cook's Bark ''Endeavour'' along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark ''Endeavour'' spar measurements [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594,<ref>National Maritime Museum Endeavour 1771 draught ZAZ6594</ref> and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10&nbsp;ft above this as was sometimes done.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8\u2013 9&nbsp;ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5&nbsp;ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>) from the level of the water line.\n\nWhereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18&nbsp;ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS ''Endeavour'' off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 at the top of this page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844.<ref>National Maritime Museum Greenwich Endeavour 1768 as fitted draught ZAZ7844</ref>\n\nUsing these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught, it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of ''Endeavour'' support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.\n\nThe replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in the hold on the keelson, as is the model in the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich. There is a difference between the height of the mizzen fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of ''Earl of Pembroke'' before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts.\n\n==Purchase and refit by the Admiralty==\nOn 16 February 1768, the [[Royal Society]] petitioned [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 [[transit of Venus]] across the sun.<ref>Rigby and van der Merwe 2002, p. 24</ref> Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the [[Admiralty]] elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent ''Terra Australis Incognita'' (or \"unknown southern land\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Secret Instructions to Lieutenant Cook 30&nbsp;July 1768 (UK) |publisher=National Library of Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |accessdate=26 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721065703/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=34 |archivedate=21 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer [[Alexander Dalrymple]], whose acceptance was conditional on a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] commission as a captain in the Royal Navy.

The line then moves south and west to New Zealand, west to the Australian coast and north to Cape York.|An 1893 chart showing ''Endeavour''{{'s}} track]]\n\n===Shipwreck===\nFor the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11&nbsp;pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef,<ref name=\"Cook11June\">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 343\u2013345</ref> today called [[Endeavour Reef]], within the [[Great Barrier Reef]] system. The sails were immediately taken down, a [[Anchor#Kedging|kedging anchor]] set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef ''Endeavour'' had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to {{convert|70|ft}} less than one ship's length away.<ref name=\"Cook11June\"/>\n\nCook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship's guns were thrown overboard, and the ship's drinking water pumped out.<ref name=\"Cook11June\"/> The crew attached [[buoy]]s to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later,<ref name=\"Parkin317\">Parkin 2003, p. 317</ref> but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 313</ref>\n\nWhen, by Cook's reckoning, about {{convert|40|to|50|long ton|t}} of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free.<ref>Hough 1994, p. 179</ref> In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20&nbsp;pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off.<ref name=\"Cook12June\">Beaglehole 1968, pp. 345\u2013346</ref> The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.<ref name=\"Cook12June\"/>\n\nAs expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in [[Sounding line|sounding]] the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about {{convert|18|in|cm}} between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak.<ref name=\"Cook12June\"/>\n\nThe prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was {{convert|24|mi}} from shore<ref name=\"Courier1878\"/> and the three ship's boats could not carry the entire crew.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 311</ref> Despite this, Joseph Banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances.<ref>Blainey 2008, p. 236</ref>\n\nMidshipman Jonathon Monkhouse<!-- sometimes spelt Munkhouse, but Cook used \"Monkhouse\" in his journal. Brother of William Monkhouse, the gunner --> proposed [[fothering]] the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 321</ref> He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of [[oakum]] and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.<ref>Parkin 2003, p. 322</ref>\n\n[[File:Endeavour at Endeavour River, engraving c. 1786.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=An old engraving shows the Endeavour beached on the shore of a bay, surrounded by wooded hills.

She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in ''Endeavour''. ''Endeavour'' sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of ''Penguin'', and four ship's carpenters whose job was to reassemble ''Penguin'' on arrival, which was 28 January 1773.

The government assessed that if British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont with maybe loss of life \u2013 this, it was feared, would trigger an outcry which might topple the government.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 546-547</ref> The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 547</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546</ref> Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 556.</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 548</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 549</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 549-550</ref>\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 356.</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 552.</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 551.</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 550</ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 357.</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 553</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese; had powers to arrest without warrant, torture and to kill extrajudicially; kidnapped businessmen for ransom; and were deeply involved in organized crime, charging a \"fee\" to all of the opium dens, brothels and casinos of Shanghai to allow them to operate.<ref name=FJp357/> In September 1939, Wang Tianmu, the chief ''Juntong'' agent in Shanghai was kidnapped on the Nanjing road by No. 76 agents, was taken to 76 Jessfield Road where he was held for three weeks before being released.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 554.</ref> Suspecting Wang, who had not been tortured had been \"turned\", Dai ordered him assassinated and a ''Juntong'' agent shot him in the shoulder during a failed attempt to kill him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554/>\n\nThe No. 76 organization blew up the headquarters of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai while the ''Juntong'' assassins killed a dozen of No. 76 organization leaders in the fall of 1939.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 555.</ref> Wang's defection to the No. 76 organization proved a most serious blow as he betrayed all of the agents under his command, and the ''Kempeitai'' arrested dozens of ''Juntong agents'' in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin due to the information provided by Wang.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 15 November 1939, Zhao Gangyi, the ''Juntong'' chief in Qingdao, fearing it was only a matter of time before the ''Kempeitai'' arrested him owing to the information provided by Wang, decided to save himself and defected over to the Wang regime,  betraying all of the agents under his command to the ''Kempeitai''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 24 November 1939, thanks to information provided by Zhao, the ''Kempeitai'' raided the ''Juntong'''s headquarters in Beijing.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nOn 21 December 1939, Ding was almost killed when his mistress, the teenage schoolgirl Zheng Pingru, led him into a ''Juntong'' assassination attempt.<ref name=WFp194>Wakeman, Frederic ''The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002 page 194.</ref> When Ding ordered his men to execute Zheng, a girl born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, she asked them not to shoot her in the face, so she would still be beautiful at her funeral, a request that No. 76 execution squad honored.<ref name=WFp194/> This incident is generally believed to have been the inspiration for the 1979 novella [[Lust, Caution (novella)|''Lust, Caution'']] by [[Eileen Chang]], which in turn inspired the 2007 film ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeital'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 546-547</ref> The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref

48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 547</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546</ref> Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 556.</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 548</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>Wen-hsin

to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 549-550</ref>\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 356.</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 552.</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 551.</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 550</ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 357.</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 553</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese;

In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}).

In 1900, she was [[beatified]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]] and was [[canonized]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]].\n\n==Early life==\nAnna H\u00f6ss was born on 20 October 1682 in [[Kaufbeuren]], in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]],<ref name=va/> to Matthias H\u00f6ss and his wife, Lucia Hoermann, the sixth of their eight children. Only three of the children survived into adulthood.\n\nShe became a weaver, but her greatest ambition was to enter the local convent of the [[Third Order|Tertiary]] Franciscans in Kaufbeuren, which occupied the old [[Meierhof]] of the town, in whose [[chapel]] she often prayed. As a poor [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]], however, her father did not have enough money to pay the customary [[dowry]] expected of a candidate, so she was not admitted.<ref>[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-crescentia-hoess/ \"Saint Crescentia Hoess\", Franciscan Media]</ref>\n\n==Monasteries of the Third Order Regular==\nUnlike monasteries of the nuns of the Franciscan [[Second Order (religious)|Second Order]], known as the [[Poor Clares]], nuns of the Third Order were completely local, living under the authority of the [[bishop]] of the [[diocese]] where they were located. The history of the [[Third Order of St. Francis]]\u2014of which these women were a part\u2014had a range of organizational models, in that many communities of religious women did not embrace the [[Enclosed religious orders|enclosure]], but considered active works of charity, tending to the poor and sick, as part of their religious and Franciscan [[charism]]. Monasteries like that of Kaufbeuren were established to pursue the purely contemplative life, usually in an urban setting.\n\nThe [[Order of Friars Minor]], however, refused to accept spiritual supervision or responsibility for those monasteries which did not accept the strictest form of [[enclosure]], such as the Poor Clares had. Thus the monastic communities of nuns of the Third Order like that of Kaufbeuren, who did not have the same connection with the public as did the active Sisters, were usually entirely dependent on the local [[clergy]] for spiritual direction and on local patrons for their survival. They were often marked by their precarious financial situations.\n\n==Life in the monastery==\nIn 1703 the Mayor of Kaufbeuren, a [[Protestant]], performed a major service to the monastery by purchasing a tavern adjacent to it which was often the source of disturbance to the quiet of the cloister, and donating the building to the nuns. He refused compensation but asked simply that, in return, Anna be accepted as a candidate.<ref name=va/> As a result of this intervention, the [[:wikt:mother superior|mother superior]] ({{lang-ger|Oberin}}) of the monastery felt obligated to receive her, and Anna was admitted in June of that year. The superior, however, resented this and referred to Anna as a \"parasite\", since she was felt not to be contributing to the community. Nevertheless, Anna received the [[religious habit]] and took the name '''Maria Crescentia'''.\n\nThe nuns were not kind to her at first, due to the manner of her admission. Once clothed as a member of the Order, Crescentia was subjected to a prolonged persecution by the unfriendly superior and some of the older nuns. They treated her as a servant, giving her the most menial tasks to perform. Although Crescentia was at first given a [[Room|cell]] of her own, it was later taken from her and given to a new [[novice]] who had brought with her the customary dowry.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofvenmarycre00jeiliala#page/44/mode/2up Jieler, Ignatius O.S.F., ''The Life of Ven.

The [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 2001 had a lasting impact on the city that continues to reverberate to the present.\n\n==Koch and Dinkins (1978\u20131993)==\n{{See also|Crime in New York City}}\nCompared to the 1970s, the 1980s were a time of restrained optimism in New York. The boom on [[Wall Street]] was fueling the speculative real estate market, and unemployment numbers dropped noticeably. Koch successfully balanced the city's budget ahead of schedule, allowing the city to re-enter the bond market and raise cash, effectively ending the city's financial crisis by 1981. However, the city's reputation for crime and disorder was still very much a part of New Yorkers' daily lives.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Crime Drop in America |chapter=The Rise and Decline of Hard Drugs, Drug Markets, and Violence in Inner-City New York |last=Johnson|first=Bruce D.|first2=Andrew|last2=Golub|author3=Eloise Dunlap|editor-last=Blumstein|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-first=Joel|editor2-last=Wallman |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86279-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=New York Murder Mystery: The True Story Behind the Crime Crash of the 1990s |url=https://archive.org/details/newyorkmurdermys0000karm |url-access=registration |last=Karmen|first=Andrew |year=2000 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=0-8147-4717-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |author= Peter Kerr\n |title= AGENTS TELL OF DRUG'S GRIP ON WALL STREET\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |date= April 18, 1987\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/18/nyregion/agents-tell-of-drug-s-grip-on-wall-street.html\n |accessdate= March 2, 2020\n}}</ref> Mayor [[Ed Koch]] repeatedly warned that filth, crime, and racial tensions were weakening the city.

Koch successfully balanced the city's budget ahead of schedule, allowing the city to re-enter the bond market and raise cash, effectively ending the city's financial crisis by 1981. However, the city's reputation for crime and disorder was still very much a part of New Yorkers' daily lives.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Crime Drop in America |chapter=The Rise and Decline of Hard Drugs, Drug Markets, and Violence in Inner-City New York |last=Johnson|first=Bruce D.|first2=Andrew|last2=Golub|author3=Eloise Dunlap|editor-last=Blumstein|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-first=Joel|editor2-last=Wallman |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86279-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=New York Murder Mystery: The True Story Behind the Crime Crash of the 1990s |url=https://archive.org/details/newyorkmurdermys0000karm |url-access=registration |last=Karmen|first=Andrew |year=2000 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=0-8147-4717-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |author= Peter Kerr\n |title= AGENTS TELL OF DRUG'S GRIP ON WALL STREET\n |newspaper= The New York Times\n |date= April 18, 1987\n |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/18/nyregion/agents-tell-of-drug-s-grip-on-wall-street.html\n |accessdate= March 2, 2020\n}}</ref> Mayor [[Ed Koch]] repeatedly warned that filth, crime, and racial tensions were weakening the city.

Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what ''New York Times'' political reporter [[Adam Nagourney]] called a \"bullpen\" open office plan, similar to a [[Wall Street]] trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.<ref>Nagourney, Adam (December 25, 2001).

Unlike in the [[New York City blackout of 1977]], there was no major looting. However, during the blackout, [[Verizon]]'s emergency generators failed several times, leaving the [[emergency services number]] [[9-1-1]] out of service for several periods of about a quarter-hour each. New York City's [[3-1-1|311]] information hotline received over 175,000 calls from concerned residents during the weekend. [[Amateur radio operator]]s attached to New York City [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service|ARES]] provided a backup communications link to emergency shelters and hospitals.  Amateur radio [[repeater]]s were supplied with emergency power and remained functional. Many major U.S. networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]) and some cable TV networks (such as [[HBO]], [[MTV]], and [[Nickelodeon]]) were unable to broadcast because of the lack of electricity in the New York City area, but back-up stations in [[Dallas]] and flagship transmitters there made it possible for prime-time television to be broadcast.
