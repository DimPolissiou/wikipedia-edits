This is because [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] data recovery techniques were not in wide use among archaeologists of that era.  The 1979 excavations took 42 samples for flotation analysis (24 from features and 18 from [[Midden|midden]] contexts) and as a result a wide variety of plant remains (wood charcoal, nutshell, maize, seeds and bulbs) were found which contribute immensely to our knowledge of [[Upper Mississippian]] subsistence.<ref name=\"Asch\">{{cite book |last1=Asch |first1=David L. |last2=Sidell |first2=Nancy Asch |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 13: Archaeobotany}}</ref>\n\nPlant analysis of flotation data is based primarily on carbonized remains; on plant material that was burned in a [[fire pit]] or [[hearth]] but not completely consumed.  The carbonized materials are rendered much more resistant to decay and thus are often available for the archaeologist to examine.  Not all of the carbonized plant remains are from food items; some of the small seeds recovered may have been intrusive due to the normal seed dispersal process (i.e. the wind just blew them into the fire).  Plant material that was not carbonized was of course subject to the normal process of decay and would not be available to the archaeologist except under extraordinary conditions.\n\n'''Summary of Findings:'''<ref name=\"Asch\"/>\n\n* [[Wood]] [[charcoal]] - the vast majority of all flotation samples (from 82-95%) were naturally from the wood that was used as firewood.  Each sample showed a great deal of diversity and although [[oak]] and [[hickory]] were dominant, [[maple]], [[ash]], [[American hornbeam]], [[American elm]], [[American hop hornbeam]], [[Populus|poplar]] and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] were also present.  This mix reflects the trees present in the surrounding [[Deciduous forest|deciduous forests]] and [[Oak savanna|oak savannas]].\n* [[Nutshell]] - was ubiquitous and present in every sample.  [[Hickory nut]] and [[black walnut]] were the dominant species; [[hazelnut]] and [[acorn]] were also present.  Trace amounts of [[Butternut (tree)|butternut]] were present in a few features.\n* [[Maize]] - was the most abundant of the food plant remains.  Kernels, cupules and cob fragments of the 8- or 10-row variety were present in all samples.\n* Cultivated seeds - 80% of all seeds recovered were of [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri)]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley (Hordeum pusillum)]] and [[Polygonum erectum|knotweed (Polygonum erectum)]].  This indicates that the [[Upper Mississippian]] residents were part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] (EAC) of cultivated seed plants that predated the introduction of [[maize]] in parts of [[North America]].  The EAC plants were first identified in [[Middle Woodland]] contexts and their use continued to the early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.\n* Other cultivated plants - [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[sunflower]] and the [[Common bean|common bean]] were also present.\n* [[Wild rice]] - was also present.  There is abundant evidence of Native American utilization of this resource in early Historic accounts.<ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Blair |editor1-first=Emma Helen |title=The Indian Tribes of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Region of the Great Lakes |date=1911-1912 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |edition=1996 reprint}}</ref>\n* Fruit seeds - [[Plum|plum]], [[sumac]], [[grape]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[ground cherry]] were also noted.\n* [[Bulb]] - a carbonized bulb of what appears to be [[Allium|wild onion]] was recovered.\n* Noneconomic seeds - seeds from several plants that are present in small quantities and do not have a food or other economic use are presumed to be intrusive; such as [[Desmodium|Desmodium (ground bulrush)]], [[Galium|Galium (tick trefoil)]], [[Xanthium|Xanthium (cocklebur)]] and [[Hypoxis hirsuta|Hypoxis hirsuta (yellow star-grass)]].  Even these intrusive seeds are useful to the archaeologist, because they can be used to help recreate the environment present at the time of site occupation.  Some of the intrusive seeds present at Oak Forest indicate a moist marshy environment was nearby, and others indicate a habitat of open fields and oak savannas.\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.  The main species present were [[deer]] and [[fish]]; also present were [[turtle]], [[dog]], [[bald eagle]], [[sandhill crane]], [[otter]] and others.  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.  Dog sacrifice and dog meat consumption was observed to have ceremonial and religious implications in early [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.<ref name=\"Greenman\">{{cite journal |last1=Greenman |first1=E.F. |title=An Early Historic Cemetery in St. Ignace |journal=The Michigan Archaeologist |date=1958 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=29-30}}</ref>  In addition, bald eagles, sandhill cranes and otters were known to have spiritual significance in historic Native American religious groups/ceremonies such as the [[Midewiwin]].<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n=== Artifacts ===\n\n[[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from the site included:<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n* [[Pottery]] - total of 1,270 sherds were recovered in the 1958 excavations, and another 3,347 were recovered in 1979.  The pottery artifacts will be discussed in more detail below.\n* Stone artifacts - including [[Projectile point|projectile points]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (including humpback scrapers), [[Burin (lithic flake)|gravers]], graver drills, knives, cores, utilized flakes and a chopper.  Of the projectile points, the most numerous category was the small triangular Madison point.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including [[Grinding Stone|grinding stones]], [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]]/[[Mano (stone)|manos]], [[Metate|metates]], abraders and a piece of [[hematite]] that may be a [[rubstone]].  \n* [[Bone]] and [[antler]] tools - including [[scapula]] [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], an antler [[Wrench|wrench]] and a [[harpoon]].\n* [[Marine shell]] - a unique [[duck]] effigy [[pendant]] made out of [[marine shell]] was present at the site.\n* Early Historic artifacts - in 1958, a single [[iron]] fragment was found which was thought to be an early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] artifact of [[Europe|European]] manufacture.  In 1979 many more such remains were found due largely to the use of [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]]; including 2 tubular sheet [[brass]] hair pipes (similar to the [[copper]] specimens found at the [[Dumaw Creek Site|Dumaw Creek site]]<ref name=\"Quimby\">{{cite journal |last1=Quimby |first1=George I. |title=The Dumaw Creek Site |journal=Fieldiana |date=1966 |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=1-91}}</ref>), 3 fragments of crumpled sheet brass, 15 iron pieces (6 nails, 1 bolt, 1 washer, a strap with pendant tabs, 2 sheet fragments and 4 unidentified fragments), and a single white glass [[bead]] similar to those found at [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] sites in [[Ontario]] and [[New York (state)|New York State]] (where they have been dated to the early 1600s).\n\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the domestic tasks performed at a site; [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Religion|religious]] activities; recreational activities; and clothing or personal adornment.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Michalik\">{{cite book |last1=Michalik |first1=Laura K. |last2=Brown |first2=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 10: Ceramic Artifacts}}</ref><ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe 1958 excavations recovered 1,270 sherds, almost all of it Huber ware.  Surface was plain on 98% of sherds and cordmarked on 2%.  Half of the lips were unnotched.  The most common rim profile reported was everted with flat lip and either wide-notched or unnotched lip.  Rarely, sherds were red-slipped on the exterior and/or interior.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nAn additional 3,347 sherds were recovered in the 1979 excavations, of very similar attributes.

Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well.  Late Huber pottery has predominately plain surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nIn the Oak Forest site assemblage, only 2.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, Wide-line decoration is reported to be rare.  Also, about half of the lips are unnotched. There is also no Fisher Ware at all in the Oak Forest assemblage; but Danner Ware is present, which has been found in early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] contexts at the Zimmerman site in northwestern [[Illinois]].  This combination of traits indicates a relatively later time placement for Oak Forest within the Huber sequence.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Michalik\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>. This is supported by 6 radiocarbon dates which indicate the occupation of Oak Forest took place between a range of A.D. 1425-1625.<ref name=\"Asch3\">{{cite book |last1=Asch |first1=David L. |last2=Brown |first2=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center For American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 8: Stratigraphy and Site Chronology}}</ref>\n\n== Huber within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region in the states of northern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]] and southwest [[Michigan]].  Both have shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown3\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the [[Oneota]] Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]], [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] and [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]] are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown3\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the [[Oneota]] tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like [[Fifield Site|Fifield]], where Fisher pottery is associated with late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Oak Forest. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and the [[common bean]].  [[Sunflower]] and [[wild rice]] were also recovered.  Also, the recovery of [[Polygonum|knotweed]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley]] and [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot]] indicates the Huber culture participated in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]].  [[Deer]] bone was also present in abundance, along with [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]] for [[Bow and arrow|bows-and-arrows]], indicating the site residents still relied on [[hunting]]; and [[fish]] and [[turtle]] were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on the presence of several house structures, and supported by an analysis of the animal bone and plant remains, the researchers determined the site functioned as a permanent to semi-permanent agricultural village.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nAlong with the [[Palos Site|Palos]] site, Oak Forest had some European-made trade articles included in the assemblage.  This indicates the Huber culture lasted until European contact and therefore was one of the Historic [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes encountered by the early explorers and [[Fur trade|fur traders]]. It has not been conclusively demonstrated which tribe exactly made the Huber pottery. However, the [[Potawatomi]], [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] and [[Miami people|Miami]] have been recorded as present in the lower shores of [[Lake Michigan]] in the early historic period, and all have been suggested as the tribe corresponding to the Huber culture.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown4\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations Into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5: Ethnohistoric Connections}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

This is because [[Flotation (archaeology)|flotation]] data recovery techniques were not in wide use among archaeologists of that era.  The 1979 excavations took 42 samples for flotation analysis (24 from features and 18 from [[Midden|midden]] contexts) and as a result a wide variety of plant remains (wood charcoal, nutshell, maize, seeds and bulbs) were found which contribute immensely to our knowledge of [[Upper Mississippian]] subsistence.<ref name=\"Asch\">{{cite book |last1=Asch |first1=David L. |last2=Sidell |first2=Nancy Asch |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 13: Archaeobotany}}</ref>\n\nPlant analysis of flotation data is based primarily on carbonized remains; on plant material that was burned in a [[fire pit]] or [[hearth]] but not completely consumed.  The carbonized materials are rendered much more resistant to decay and thus are often available for the archaeologist to examine.  Not all of the carbonized plant remains are from food items; some of the small seeds recovered may have been intrusive due to the normal seed dispersal process (i.e. the wind just blew them into the fire).  Plant material that was not carbonized was of course subject to the normal process of decay and would not be available to the archaeologist except under extraordinary conditions.\n\n'''Summary of Findings:'''<ref name=\"Asch\"/>\n\n* [[Wood]] [[charcoal]] - the vast majority of all flotation samples (from 82-95%) were naturally from the wood that was used as firewood.  Each sample showed a great deal of diversity and although [[oak]] and [[hickory]] were dominant, [[maple]], [[ash]], [[American hornbeam]], [[American elm]], [[American hop hornbeam]], [[Populus|poplar]] and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] were also present.  This mix reflects the trees present in the surrounding [[Deciduous forest|deciduous forests]] and [[Oak savanna|oak savannas]].\n* [[Nutshell]] - was ubiquitous and present in every sample.  [[Hickory nut]] and [[black walnut]] were the dominant species; [[hazelnut]] and [[acorn]] were also present.  Trace amounts of [[Butternut (tree)|butternut]] were present in a few features.\n* [[Maize]] - was the most abundant of the food plant remains.  Kernels, cupules and cob fragments of the 8- or 10-row variety were present in all samples.\n* Cultivated seeds - 80% of all seeds recovered were of [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri)]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley (Hordeum pusillum)]] and [[Polygonum erectum|knotweed (Polygonum erectum)]].  This indicates that the [[Upper Mississippian]] residents were part of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] (EAC) of cultivated seed plants that predated the introduction of [[maize]] in parts of [[North America]].  The EAC plants were first identified in [[Middle Woodland]] contexts and their use continued to the early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.\n* Other cultivated plants - [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[sunflower]] and the [[Common bean|common bean]] were also present.\n* [[Wild rice]] - was also present.  There is abundant evidence of Native American utilization of this resource in early Historic accounts.<ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Blair |editor1-first=Emma Helen |title=The Indian Tribes of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Region of the Great Lakes |date=1911-1912 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |edition=1996 reprint}}</ref>\n* Fruit seeds - [[Plum|plum]], [[sumac]], [[grape]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] and [[ground cherry]] were also noted.\n* [[Bulb]] - a carbonized bulb of what appears to be [[Allium|wild onion]] was recovered.\n* Noneconomic seeds - seeds from several plants that are present in small quantities and do not have a food or other economic use are presumed to be intrusive; such as [[Desmodium|Desmodium (ground bulrush)]], [[Galium|Galium (tick trefoil)]], [[Xanthium|Xanthium (cocklebur)]] and [[Hypoxis hirsuta|Hypoxis hirsuta (yellow star-grass)]].  Even these intrusive seeds are useful to the archaeologist, because they can be used to help recreate the environment present at the time of site occupation.  Some of the intrusive seeds present at Oak Forest indicate a moist marshy environment was nearby, and others indicate a habitat of open fields and oak savannas.\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.  The main species present were [[deer]] and [[fish]]; also present were [[turtle]], [[dog]], [[bald eagle]], [[sandhill crane]], [[otter]] and others.  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.

Surface was plain on 98% of sherds and cordmarked on 2%.  Half of the lips were unnotched.  The most common rim profile reported was everted with flat lip and either wide-notched or unnotched lip.  Rarely, sherds were red-slipped on the exterior and/or interior.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nAn additional 3,347 sherds were recovered in the 1979 excavations, of very similar attributes.

Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well.  Late Huber pottery has predominately plain surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nIn the Oak Forest site assemblage, only 2.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, Wide-line decoration is reported to be rare.  Also, about half of the lips are unnotched. There is also no Fisher Ware at all in the Oak Forest assemblage; but Danner Ware is present, which has been found in early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] contexts at the Zimmerman site in northwestern [[Illinois]].  This combination of traits indicates a relatively later time placement for Oak Forest within the Huber sequence.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Michalik\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>. This is supported by 6 radiocarbon dates which indicate the occupation of Oak Forest took place between a range of A.D. 1425-1625.<ref name=\"Asch3\">{{cite book |last1=Asch |first1=David L. |last2=Brown |first2=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center For American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 8: Stratigraphy and Site Chronology}}</ref>\n\n== Huber within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region in the states of northern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]] and southwest [[Michigan]].  Both have shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly cordmarked surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown3\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: the Oneota Tradition}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the [[Oneota]] Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]], [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] and [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]] are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown3\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the [[Oneota]] tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like [[Fifield Site|Fifield]], where Fisher pottery is associated with late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the [[Protohistory|Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Oak Forest. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with [[Squash (plant)|squash]] and the [[common bean]].  [[Sunflower]] and [[wild rice]] were also recovered.  Also, the recovery of [[Polygonum|knotweed]], [[Hordeum pusillum|little barley]] and [[Chenopodium berlandieri|goosefoot]] indicates the Huber culture participated in the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]].  [[Deer]] bone was also present in abundance, along with [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]] for [[Bow and arrow|bows-and-arrows]], indicating the site residents still relied on [[hunting]]; and [[fish]] and [[turtle]] were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on the presence of several house structures, and supported by an analysis of the animal bone and plant remains, the researchers determined the site functioned as a permanent to semi-permanent agricultural village.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nAlong with the [[Palos Site|Palos]] site, Oak Forest had some European-made trade articles included in the assemblage.  This indicates the Huber culture lasted until European contact and therefore was one of the Historic [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes encountered by the early explorers and [[Fur trade|fur traders]]. It has not been conclusively demonstrated which tribe exactly made the Huber pottery. However, the [[Potawatomi]], [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] and [[Miami people|Miami]] have been recorded as present in the lower shores of [[Lake Michigan]] in the early historic period, and all have been suggested as the tribe corresponding to the Huber culture.<ref name=\"Brown3\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Brown4\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations Into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5: Ethnohistoric Connections}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

The CGT was violently opposed to both the authorities and employers. Moreover, it refused to become affiliated with a political party.\n\nIn 1906, the [[Amiens Charter]] (''Charte d'Amiens'') proclaimed the independence of this trade union.\n\nIn 1909, members of the union management and hundreds of CGT members were killed by the French government led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], who called the troops to open fire on the strikers.\n\n==== World War I: Dissension ====\n\nUnder the leadership of [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]], the Confederation joined the \"[[sacred union]]\" during World War I, which provoked the CGT's first internal division.\nWhile Jouhaux tried to associate the CGT with the authorities, his opponents criticized the pervasive air of nationalism and the preference for struggle with the German proletarians rather than the French employers.\nThey welcomed news of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] with hope.\n\nIn 1919, [[Pierre Monatte]] created the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] (''Comit\u00e9s syndicalistes r\u00e9volutionnaires'') current inside the CGT, which opposed the trade-union's collaboration with the government during the war; carried out in the name of the ''[[Union sacr\u00e9e]]'' national bloc.\n\n==== The hope of October 1917 ====\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the French labour movement became increasingly divided between [[revolution]]aries who supported the Bolsheviks and strong action at home, and [[Reformism|reformists]] who favoured moderation and re-affiliation to the pre-war [[Socialist International|Second International]].\nOne outcome of this division was the expulsion of the revolutionaries.\nFollowing the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] during which the majority of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) members voted to accept [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]'s [[21 Conditions]], leading to the creation of the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC), the CGT also split.\n\nRadicals created the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire]]'' (CGTU), where communists initially cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists.\n\n==== Reconciliation and World War II ====\n\nIn 1934, left-wing parties united to counteract the far-right \"ligues\".\n\nTwo years later, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 legislative election]].\n\nAt the same time, the CGT and the CGTU were reunited. [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] negotiated in June with employers and the Government for the [[1936 Matignon Agreements]]. Nevertheless, the Communists were as a result of the [[German-Soviet pact]] in 1939, then the CGT was dissolved by the [[Vichy government]] but it transformed itself into an organization in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].\n\nIt became increasingly influenced by the [[French Communist Party]].\n\n==== 1945 to 1947 : Division ====\n\nAfter the ejection of the Communists from the government and the 1947 General Strike, a further split took place, this time involving the departure of the reformist Right, followed in 1948, when [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]] founded [[Force Ouvri\u00e8re|Workers' Force]] (''Force ouvri\u00e8re'' or FO) with U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] support {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nThe FO criticized the Communist influence as being incompatible with the ''Charte d'Amiens''; and they were generally  [[socialist]],  some [[trotskyist]], some [[anarchist]].\n\nIn order to preserve its unity, the [[Federation for National Education]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Education nationale'' or FEN) left the CGT but did not join the FO.\n\nThe Communist [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] became leader of the CGT.\n\n=== 1947 to 1990s : The domination of the French Communist Party ===\n==== Alliance and Union of the Left ====\n\nAlthough the CGT was dominant in French trade unionism, it was isolated until 1966.\nAt this moment, it chose to coordinate its actions with the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail|French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (''Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail'' or CFDT).\n\nDuring [[May 1968 in France]], the CGT was criticized by the far-left because its leader [[Georges S\u00e9guy]] had signed the [[Grenelle agreements]] with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], it was assimilated as a betrayal of the revolution.\n\nIn the 1970s, it supported the \"Union of Left\" (alliance between the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) and [[Parti Radical de Gauche]] (PRG)).\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[1978 French legislative elections|1978 legislative election]], the alliance with the CFDT (who were more linked with the Socialist Party and turned right after the abandon of the \"autogestion\" (self-rule) and class struggle) was broken.\n\n==== The 1980s ====\n\nThe election of [[Henri Krasucki]] in 1982, followed by the resignation of the Communist ministers ([[Charles Fiterman]], [[Marcel Rigout]] and [[Jack Ralite]]) two years later, after the substitution of [[Laurent Fabius]] as Prime minister to [[Pierre Mauroy]], led to an initial radicalisation of the confederation.\n\nHowever, at the end of his term (1982\u20131992), Krasucki began to distance himself from the PCF.<ref name=R89_07>[[Pascal Rich\u00e9]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/21/en-pronant-la-negociation-la-cgt-peut-faire-bouger-le-syndicalisme En pr\u00f4nant la n\u00e9gociation, la CGT \"peut faire bouger le syndicalisme\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 21 November 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis successor, [[Louis Vianet]], did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\nThus, during the 1990s, under the leadership of [[Louis Viannet]] and [[Bernard Thibault]], the CGT cut its organic links with the French Communist Party.

The CGT was violently opposed to both the authorities and employers. Moreover, it refused to become affiliated with a political party.\n\nIn 1906, the [[Amiens Charter]] (''Charte d'Amiens'') proclaimed the independence of this trade union.\n\nIn 1909, members of the union management and hundreds of CGT members were killed by the French government led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], who called the troops to open fire on the strikers.\n\n==== World War I: Dissension ====\n\nUnder the leadership of [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]], the Confederation joined the \"[[sacred union]]\" during World War I, which provoked the CGT's first internal division.\nWhile Jouhaux tried to associate the CGT with the authorities, his opponents criticized the pervasive air of nationalism and the preference for struggle with the German proletarians rather than the French employers.\nThey welcomed news of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] with hope.\n\nIn 1919, [[Pierre Monatte]] created the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] (''Comit\u00e9s syndicalistes r\u00e9volutionnaires'') current inside the CGT, which opposed the trade-union's collaboration with the government during the war; carried out in the name of the ''[[Union sacr\u00e9e]]'' national bloc.\n\n==== The hope of October 1917 ====\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the French labour movement became increasingly divided between [[revolution]]aries who supported the Bolsheviks and strong action at home, and [[Reformism|reformists]] who favoured moderation and re-affiliation to the pre-war [[Socialist International|Second International]].\nOne outcome of this division was the expulsion of the revolutionaries.\nFollowing the 1920 [[Tours Congress]] during which the majority of [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) members voted to accept [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]]'s [[21 Conditions]], leading to the creation of the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC), the CGT also split.\n\nRadicals created the ''[[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail unitaire]]'' (CGTU), where communists initially cohabited with anarchists and revolutionary trade unionists.\n\n==== Reconciliation and World War II ====\n\nIn 1934, left-wing parties united to counteract the far-right \"ligues\".\n\nTwo years later, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 French legislative election|1936 legislative election]].\n\nAt the same time, the CGT and the CGTU were reunited. [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] negotiated in June with employers and the Government for the [[1936 Matignon Agreements]]. Nevertheless, the Communists were as a result of the [[German-Soviet pact]] in 1939, then the CGT was dissolved by the [[Vichy government]] but it transformed itself into an organization in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].\n\nIt became increasingly influenced by the [[French Communist Party]].\n\n==== 1945 to 1947 : Division ====\n\nAfter the ejection of the Communists from the government and the 1947 General Strike, a further split took place, this time involving the departure of the reformist Right, followed in 1948, when [[L\u00e9on Jouhaux]] founded [[Force Ouvri\u00e8re|Workers' Force]] (''Force ouvri\u00e8re'' or FO) with U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] support {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nThe FO criticized the Communist influence as being incompatible with the ''Charte d'Amiens''; and they were generally  [[socialist]],  some [[trotskyist]], some [[anarchist]].\n\nIn order to preserve its unity, the [[Federation for National Education]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de l'Education nationale'' or FEN) left the CGT but did not join the FO.\n\nThe Communist [[Beno\u00eet Frachon]] became leader of the CGT.\n\n=== 1947 to 1990s : The domination of the French Communist Party ===\n==== Alliance and Union of the Left ====\n\nAlthough the CGT was dominant in French trade unionism, it was isolated until 1966.\nAt this moment, it chose to coordinate its actions with the [[Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise D\u00e9mocratique du Travail|French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (''Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail'' or CFDT).\n\nDuring [[May 1968 in France]], the CGT was criticized by the far-left because its leader [[Georges S\u00e9guy]] had signed the [[Grenelle agreements]] with Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], it was assimilated as a betrayal of the revolution.\n\nIn the 1970s, it supported the \"Union of Left\" (alliance between the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) and [[Parti Radical de Gauche]] (PRG)).\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[1978 French legislative elections|1978 legislative election]], the alliance with the CFDT (who were more linked with the Socialist Party and turned right after the abandon of the \"autogestion\" (self-rule) and class struggle) was broken.\n\n==== The 1980s ====\n\nThe election of [[Henri Krasucki]] in 1982, followed by the resignation of the Communist ministers ([[Charles Fiterman]], [[Marcel Rigout]] and [[Jack Ralite]]) two years later, after the substitution of [[Laurent Fabius]] as Prime minister to [[Pierre Mauroy]], led to an initial radicalisation of the confederation.\n\nHowever, at the end of his term (1982\u20131992), Krasucki began to distance himself from the PCF.<ref name=R89_07>[[Pascal Rich\u00e9]], [http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/21/en-pronant-la-negociation-la-cgt-peut-faire-bouger-le-syndicalisme En pr\u00f4nant la n\u00e9gociation, la CGT \"peut faire bouger le syndicalisme\"], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 21 November 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis successor, [[Louis Vianet]], did the same, going as far as resigning from the political bureau of the party.<ref name=R89_07/>\n\nThus, during the 1990s, under the leadership of [[Louis Viannet]] and [[Bernard Thibault]], the CGT cut its organic links with the French Communist Party.

Depending on jurisdiction and university, these may be either undergraduate-entry (most of Europe, Asia, South America and Oceania), or [[Graduate Entry Program|graduate-entry programs]] (mainly Australia, Philippines and North America). Some jurisdictions and universities provide both undergraduate entry programs and graduate entry programs (Australia, South Korea).\n\nIn general, initial training is taken at [[medical school]]. Traditionally initial medical education is divided between ''preclinical'' and ''clinical'' studies. The former consists of the basic sciences such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]]. The latter consists of teaching in the various areas of clinical medicine such as [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practice]] and [[surgery]].\n\nThere has been a proliferation of programmes that combine medical training with research (M.D./Ph.D.) or management programmes (M.D./ MBA), although this has been criticised because extended interruption to clinical study has been shown to have a detrimental effect on ultimate clinical knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dyrbye LN|author2=Thomas MR|author3=Natt N|author4=Rohren CH|title=Prolonged Delays for Research Training in Medical School are Associated with Poorer Subsequent Clinical Knowledge|journal=J Gen Intern Med|date=2007|pmid=17492473|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0200-x|volume=22|pages=1101\u20136|issue=8|pmc=2305740}}</ref>\n\n==Postgraduate education==\n\nFollowing completion of entry-level training, newly graduated doctors are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted; this is most often of one-year duration and may be referred to as an \"internship\" or \"provisional registration\" or \"[[Residency (medicine)|residency]]\".\n\n[[File:D\u011bkan\u00e1t 1.LF UK.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Dean's office at the [[First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|First Faculty of Medicine]], [[Charles University]], [[Prague]]]]\n\nFurther training in a particular field of medicine may be undertaken. In the U.S., further specialized training, completed after residency is referred to as \"fellowship\".  In some jurisdictions, this is commenced immediately following completion of entry-level training, while other jurisdictions require junior doctors to undertake generalist (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing specialisation.\n\nEducation theory itself is becoming an integral part of postgraduate medical training. Formal qualifications in education are also becoming the norm for medical educators, such that there has been a rapid increase in the number of available graduate programs in medical education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page: master's degree in health professions education programs.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=September 2013|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1399|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e31829decf6|pmid=23982511}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page.

Among some institutions and for some students, it may be 6 years (including the selection of an intercalated BSc\u2014taking one year\u2014at some point after the pre-clinical studies).  All programs culminate in the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] degree (abbreviated MBChB, MBBS, MBBCh, BM, etc.). This is followed by 2 clinical foundation years afterward, namely F1 and F2, similar to internship training. Students register with the UK [[General Medical Council]] at the end of F1. At the end of F2, they may pursue further years of study. The system in Australia is very similar, with registration by the Australian Medical Council (AMC).\n\nIn the US and Canada, a potential medical student must first complete an undergraduate degree in any subject before applying to a graduate medical school to pursue an ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) program.  U.S. medical schools are almost all four-year programs.  Some students opt for the research-focused M.D./Ph.D. dual degree program, which is usually completed in 7\u201310 years. There are certain courses that are pre-requisite for being accepted to medical school, such as general [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]], [[English language|English]], labwork, etc. The specific requirements vary by school.\n\nIn Australia, there are two pathways to a medical degree. Students can choose to take a five- or six-year undergraduate medical degree [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS or BMed) as a first tertiary degree directly after secondary school graduation, or first complete a bachelor's degree (in general three years, usually in the medical sciences) and then apply for a four-year [[Graduate Medical Program|graduate entry]] [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/pathways/medicine/#registration|title=Medicine - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surgeons.org/becoming-a-surgeon/surgery-as-a-career/pathways-through-specialty-medical-training/|title=Pathways through specialty medical training|last=(RACS)|first=Royal Australasian College of Surgeons|website=www.surgeons.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n\nSee:{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* North America\n**[[Medical school in Canada|Medical education in Canada]]\n**[[Medical education in Panama]]\n**[[Medical education in Mexico]]\n**[[Medical education in the United States]]\n* Europe\n**[[Medical education in France]]\n**[[Medical education in Norway]]\n**[[Medical education in the United Kingdom]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Asia/Middle East/Oceania\n**[[Medical education in Australia]]\n**[[Medical education in china|Medical education in China]]\n**[[Medical education in Hong Kong]]\n**[[Medical College (India)|Medical education in India]]\n**[[Medical education in Jordan]]\n**[[Medical education in the Philippines]]\n* Africa\n**[[Medical education in South Africa]]\n**[[Medical education in Uganda]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Integration with [[health policy]] ==\nAs medical professional stakeholders in the field of health care (i.e. entities integrally involved in the health care system and affected by reform), the practice of medicine (i.e. diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disease) is directly affected by the ongoing changes in both national and local health policy and economics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Michael L.|title=Introduction: Health Policy and Health Care Economics Observed|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=149\u2013151|doi=10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.01.001|pmid=18513623|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nThere is a growing call for health professional training programs to not only adopt more rigorous health policy education and leadership training,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=R.

Depending on jurisdiction and university, these may be either undergraduate-entry (most of Europe, Asia, South America and Oceania), or [[Graduate Entry Program|graduate-entry programs]] (mainly Australia, Philippines and North America). Some jurisdictions and universities provide both undergraduate entry programs and graduate entry programs (Australia, South Korea).\n\nIn general, initial training is taken at [[medical school]]. Traditionally initial medical education is divided between ''preclinical'' and ''clinical'' studies. The former consists of the basic sciences such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]]. The latter consists of teaching in the various areas of clinical medicine such as [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practice]] and [[surgery]].\n\nThere has been a proliferation of programmes that combine medical training with research (M.D./Ph.D.) or management programmes (M.D./ MBA), although this has been criticised because extended interruption to clinical study has been shown to have a detrimental effect on ultimate clinical knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dyrbye LN|author2=Thomas MR|author3=Natt N|author4=Rohren CH|title=Prolonged Delays for Research Training in Medical School are Associated with Poorer Subsequent Clinical Knowledge|journal=J Gen Intern Med|date=2007|pmid=17492473|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0200-x|volume=22|pages=1101\u20136|issue=8|pmc=2305740}}</ref>\n\n==Postgraduate education==\n\nFollowing completion of entry-level training, newly graduated doctors are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted; this is most often of one-year duration and may be referred to as an \"internship\" or \"provisional registration\" or \"[[Residency (medicine)|residency]]\".\n\n[[File:D\u011bkan\u00e1t 1.LF UK.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Dean's office at the [[First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|First Faculty of Medicine]], [[Charles University]], [[Prague]]]]\n\nFurther training in a particular field of medicine may be undertaken. In the U.S., further specialized training, completed after residency is referred to as \"fellowship\".  In some jurisdictions, this is commenced immediately following completion of entry-level training, while other jurisdictions require junior doctors to undertake generalist (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing specialisation.\n\nEducation theory itself is becoming an integral part of postgraduate medical training. Formal qualifications in education are also becoming the norm for medical educators, such that there has been a rapid increase in the number of available graduate programs in medical education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page: master's degree in health professions education programs.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=September 2013|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1399|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e31829decf6|pmid=23982511}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page.

Among some institutions and for some students, it may be 6 years (including the selection of an intercalated BSc\u2014taking one year\u2014at some point after the pre-clinical studies).  All programs culminate in the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] degree (abbreviated MBChB, MBBS, MBBCh, BM, etc.). This is followed by 2 clinical foundation years afterward, namely F1 and F2, similar to internship training. Students register with the UK [[General Medical Council]] at the end of F1. At the end of F2, they may pursue further years of study. The system in Australia is very similar, with registration by the Australian Medical Council (AMC).\n\nIn the US and Canada, a potential medical student must first complete an undergraduate degree in any subject before applying to a graduate medical school to pursue an ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) program.  U.S. medical schools are almost all four-year programs.  Some students opt for the research-focused M.D./Ph.D. dual degree program, which is usually completed in 7\u201310 years. There are certain courses that are pre-requisite for being accepted to medical school, such as general [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]], [[English language|English]], labwork, etc. The specific requirements vary by school.\n\nIn Australia, there are two pathways to a medical degree. Students can choose to take a five- or six-year undergraduate medical degree [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS or BMed) as a first tertiary degree directly after secondary school graduation, or first complete a bachelor's degree (in general three years, usually in the medical sciences) and then apply for a four-year [[Graduate Medical Program|graduate entry]] [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/pathways/medicine/#registration|title=Medicine - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surgeons.org/becoming-a-surgeon/surgery-as-a-career/pathways-through-specialty-medical-training/|title=Pathways through specialty medical training|last=(RACS)|first=Royal Australasian College of Surgeons|website=www.surgeons.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n\nSee:{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* North America\n**[[Medical school in Canada|Medical education in Canada]]\n**[[Medical education in Panama]]\n**[[Medical education in Mexico]]\n**[[Medical education in the United States]]\n* Europe\n**[[Medical education in France]]\n**[[Medical education in Norway]]\n**[[Medical education in the United Kingdom]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Asia/Middle East/Oceania\n**[[Medical education in Australia]]\n**[[Medical education in china|Medical education in China]]\n**[[Medical education in Hong Kong]]\n**[[Medical College (India)|Medical education in India]]\n**[[Medical education in Jordan]]\n**[[Medical education in the Philippines]]\n* Africa\n**[[Medical education in South Africa]]\n**[[Medical education in Uganda]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Integration with [[health policy]] ==\nAs medical professional stakeholders in the field of health care (i.e. entities integrally involved in the health care system and affected by reform), the practice of medicine (i.e. diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disease) is directly affected by the ongoing changes in both national and local health policy and economics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Michael L.|title=Introduction: Health Policy and Health Care Economics Observed|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=149\u2013151|doi=10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.01.001|pmid=18513623|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nThere is a growing call for health professional training programs to not only adopt more rigorous health policy education and leadership training,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=R.
