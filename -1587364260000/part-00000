The EP featured four non-album tracks. It was issued on 15 November 1985, two weeks prior to another EP, ''[[Echoes in a Shallow Bay]]''. The two EP sets, which featured complementary artwork, were also released as a combined double EP in a gatefold cover and as an eight-track CD. The EP was reissued in 1991 as part of ''[[The Box Set (Cocteau Twins)|The Box Set]]'' and in 2005 as part of the singles/EP collection ''[[Lullabies to Violaine]]''.\n\n==Release details==\nThe band did not originally intend to release these songs to the general public, presumably explaining the decision to release the material on EPs, rather than as what would have been their fourth album. The tracks on ''Tiny Dynamine'' and ''Echoes in a Shallow Bay'' were initially recorded to test the production capacities of a new studio. When the band decided the material was strong enough for release, they completed the recording process and issued the finished product on two EPs.\n\n\"Pink Orange Red\" and \"Plain Tiger\" were performed live. An acoustic version of \"Pink Orange Red\" appeared on the 1995 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Twinlights]]'', and a remastered version appeared on the 2000 compilation ''[[Stars and Topsoil]]''.\n\nMany of the titles on the two EPs seem to have some link with [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths). Most are obscure, but the [[dynamine]] is a genus of nymphalid butterflies found in South America, the [[plain tiger]] is a common Asian butterfly and the lyrics to \"Melonella\" (on ''Echoes In A Shallow Bay'') are simply a recounting of various Lepidopteric [[family (biology)|family]] names such as [[Hesperiidae]] and [[Papilionidae]].\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by Cocteau Twins.\n\n===12\": 4AD / BAD 510 (UK) ===\n\n# \"Pink Orange Red\" - 4:41\n# \"Ribbed and Veined\" - 4:00\n# \"Plain Tiger\" - 4:01\n# \"Sultitan Itan\" - 3:53\n\n=== CD: 4AD / BAD 510 CD (UK) ===\n\n# \"Pink Orange Red\" - 4:41\n# \"Ribbed and Veined\" - 4:00\n# \"Plain Tiger\" - 4:01\n# \"Sultitan Itan\" - 3:53\n# \"Great Spangled Fritillary\" - 4:02\n# \"Melonella\" - 4:05\n# \"Pale Clouded White\" - 4:59\n# \"Eggs and Their Shells\" - 3:06\n\n* Tracks 5-8 from ''[[Echoes in a Shallow Bay]]'' EP\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Elizabeth Fraser]] - [[Singing|vocals]]\n*[[Robin Guthrie]] - [[guitar]]\n*[[Simon Raymonde]] - [[bass guitar]]\n\n==Release Notes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n* Produced by Cocteau Twins.

The resort included a 31-floor tower, inspired by the design of the [[Space Needle]] tower in [[Seattle]]. Frank Caroll, the project's original owner, purchased the property in 1961. Fremont Construction began work on the tower that September, while Caroll opened the adjacent Landmark Plaza shopping center and Landmark Apartments by the end of the year. The tower's completion was expected for early 1963, but because of a lack of financing, construction was stopped in 1962, with the resort approximately 80 percent complete. Up to 1969, the [[Topping out|topped-off]] tower was the [[List of tallest buildings in Nevada|tallest building in Nevada]] until the completion of the [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino|International Hotel]] across the street.\n\nIn 1966, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Central Teamsters Pension Fund]] provided a $5.5 million construction loan to finish the project, with ownership transferred to a group of investors that included Caroll and his wife. The Landmark's completion and opening was delayed several more times. In April 1968, Caroll withdrew his request for a gaming license after he was charged with [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] against the project's interior designer. The Landmark was put up for sale that month.\n\nBillionaire [[Howard Hughes]], through [[Hughes Tool Company]], purchased the Landmark in 1969 at a cost of $17.3 million. Hughes spent approximately $3 million to add his own touches to the resort before opening it on July 1, 1969, with 400 [[slot machine]]s and 503 hotel rooms. In addition to a {{convert|14000|sqft|abbr=on}} ground-floor casino, the resort also had a second, smaller casino on the 29th floor; it was the first high-rise casino in Nevada. Aside from the second casino, the five-story [[cupola]] dome at the top of the tower also featured restaurants, lounges, and a night club.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Landmark became known for its performances by [[country music]] artists. The resort also played host to celebrities such as [[Danny Thomas]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. However, the resort suffered financial problems after its opening and underwent several ownership changes, none of which resulted in success. The Landmark entered bankruptcy in 1985, and ultimately closed on August 8, 1990, unable to compete with new megaresorts. The [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]] purchased the property in September 1993, and demolished the resort in November 1995, to add a 2,200-space parking lot for its convention center. In 2019, work was underway on a convention center expansion which includes the former site of the Landmark.\n\n== History ==\nFrank Caroll, also known as Frank Caracciolo,<ref>{{cite news|title=Howard Hughes confirms offer to buy Tower hotel|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11422529/redlands_daily_facts/|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=Redlands Daily Facts|date=October 24, 1968|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929092236/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11422529/redlands_daily_facts/|archivedate=September 29, 2017}}</ref> was a building developer from Kansas City.

The resort included a 31-floor tower, inspired by the design of the [[Space Needle]] tower in [[Seattle]]. Frank Caroll, the project's original owner, purchased the property in 1961. Fremont Construction began work on the tower that September, while Caroll opened the adjacent Landmark Plaza shopping center and Landmark Apartments by the end of the year. The tower's completion was expected for early 1963, but because of a lack of financing, construction was stopped in 1962, with the resort approximately 80 percent complete. Up to 1969, the [[Topping out|topped-off]] tower was the [[List of tallest buildings in Nevada|tallest building in Nevada]] until the completion of the [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino|International Hotel]] across the street.\n\nIn 1966, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Central Teamsters Pension Fund]] provided a $5.5 million construction loan to finish the project, with ownership transferred to a group of investors that included Caroll and his wife. The Landmark's completion and opening was delayed several more times. In April 1968, Caroll withdrew his request for a gaming license after he was charged with [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] against the project's interior designer. The Landmark was put up for sale that month.\n\nBillionaire [[Howard Hughes]], through [[Hughes Tool Company]], purchased the Landmark in 1969 at a cost of $17.3 million. Hughes spent approximately $3 million to add his own touches to the resort before opening it on July 1, 1969, with 400 [[slot machine]]s and 503 hotel rooms. In addition to a {{convert|14000|sqft|abbr=on}} ground-floor casino, the resort also had a second, smaller casino on the 29th floor; it was the first high-rise casino in Nevada. Aside from the second casino, the five-story [[cupola]] dome at the top of the tower also featured restaurants, lounges, and a night club.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Landmark became known for its performances by [[country music]] artists. The resort also played host to celebrities such as [[Danny Thomas]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. However, the resort suffered financial problems after its opening and underwent several ownership changes, none of which resulted in success. The Landmark entered bankruptcy in 1985, and ultimately closed on August 8, 1990, unable to compete with new megaresorts. The [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]] purchased the property in September 1993, and demolished the resort in November 1995, to add a 2,200-space parking lot for its convention center. In 2019, work was underway on a convention center expansion which includes the former site of the Landmark.\n\n== History ==\nFrank Caroll, also known as Frank Caracciolo,<ref>{{cite news|title=Howard Hughes confirms offer to buy Tower hotel|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11422529/redlands_daily_facts/|accessdate=September 28, 2017|work=Redlands Daily Facts|date=October 24, 1968|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929092236/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11422529/redlands_daily_facts/|archivedate=September 29, 2017}}</ref> was a building developer from Kansas City.
