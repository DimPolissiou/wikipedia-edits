As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>\n\nIn the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>\n\nAASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>\n\nSome two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.\n\n===Signage===\nRoute numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.  Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.

Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>\n\nIn the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>\n\nAASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>\n\nSome two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.\n\n===Signage===\nRoute numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.

Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.

Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

He was born in [[Mannheim]], [[German Empire|Germany]].\n\n==Early career==\nRohr, known primarily by his nickname \"Ossi\", began his career in the 1920s as a striker for hometown clubs ''FC Ph\u00f6nix Mannheim'' and later for [[VfR Mannheim]]. He was quickly marked as a talented striker with a natural instinct for scoring goals.  Fueled by the desire to display his talents at a higher level, he signed with [[FC Bayern Munich]] in 1930.  In his first season with FC Bayern, Rohr and his teammates barely missed out on the final round of the German Championship.  In his second season with the club, FC Bayern went on to defeat [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in the final and claim its first German Championship with a 2\u20130 victory.  Ossi Rohr, who scored one of the two goals in the match against Eintracht, was German Champion at the young age of 20 years.  The following year, Bayern's fortunes were significantly poorer, resulting in a mid-table finish within [[Bavaria]].  This lackluster finish encouraged Rohr to continue his career elsewhere.\n\nAt the age of 19, Rohr received his first [[German national football team|German national team]] call-up by German manager [[Otto Nerz]].  There he found himself on the pitch with stars such as [[Ernst Kuzorra]] and [[Richard Hofmann]].  He played in a total of four national team matches through March 1933, receiving his first cap a year earlier against [[Swiss national football team|Switzerland]] (2\u20130) in March 1932. He later scored two goals in a 4\u20133 win against [[Swedish national football team|Sweden]], one goal in a 1\u20133 loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and two goals in a 3\u20133 draw with [[France national football team|France]]. With five goals in four matches,<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/orohr-intl.html | title = Oskar 'Ossi' Rohr - Goals in International Matches | first = Matthias | last = Arnhold | date = 25 August 2016 | accessdate = 26 August 2016 | publisher = [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]}}</ref> Rohr looked to be on the verge of a very successful national career.\n\n==Success Abroad==\nDuring the summer of 1933, Rohr transferred to [[Grasshoppers Z\u00fcrich]] in the [[Axpo Super League|Swiss League]], where he would go on to win the [[Swiss Cup]].  Although football results were important to him, Rohr's real mission was to earn a living playing football.  The pursuit of money convinced him to transfer to [[Ligue 1|French League]] side [[Racing Strasbourg]].  Due to his numerous transfers, football magazine \"Der Fu\u00dfball\" referred to Rohr as ''\"the Gladiator, whom sells himself abroad.\"\n\nThis antagonism towards Rohr only endeared him even more to the press and fans in the [[Alsace]].  During the 1934\u201335 season, he proved his worth scoring 20 goals in 22 matches while leading Strasbourg to runner-up in the French Championship.  The following season Rohr scored at an even higher rate, netting 28 goals in 28 matches.  This performance saw him end up second on the French goal scoring list, with Strasbourg finishing third in the league. Although only finishing 6th in the league during the 1936\u201337 season, Rohr did obtain a [[French Cup]] runners-up medal with Strasbourg, as well as becoming the French League scoring champion with 30 goals.  The following season he would finish again in second on the goal scoring list with 25 goals.  With 117 Ligue 1 goals, Rohr is still the all-time goal scorer at Racing Strasbourg.  He is still fondly remembered by fans of the club.\n\n==War Years==\nThe start of World War II in 1939, as well as the occupation of various parts of France by the German Army in 1940, troubled Rohr and he decided to flee to [[S\u00e8te]] in southern, unoccupied France where he live until 1942.  During this time, the [[Third Reich]] declared him [[Persona non grata]]. It is unknown if he played at local club FC S\u00e8te during this time period; he was however, not listed on the players roster during the 1941\u201342 season.  Additionally disputed is whether Rohr served as a member of the [[French Foreign Legion]] between 1940\u20131942.\n\nIn November 1942, he was sentenced to a three-month prison term after his arrest by French police in [[Marseille]] for \"anti-French or communist propaganda.\"  He was handed over to the authorities by his nephew, [[Philip Rohr]].  He served his sentence at the Strasbourg Citadel, after which he was handed over to German authorities.  The [[Gestapo]] interned him in a concentration camp at Karlsruhe-Kieslau; two months later he was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].  After arriving at the Eastern Front, Rohr was permitted to join a German Army football team, enabling him to perform the one task he truly enjoyed; scoring goals.  Shortly before the end of the war, a German pilot recognized him from his football days and offered him a flight back to Germany.\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the war ended, Rohr decided to remain in Germany instead of returning to Strasbourg.

He was born in [[Mannheim]], [[German Empire|Germany]].\n\n==Early career==\nRohr, known primarily by his nickname \"Ossi\", began his career in the 1920s as a striker for hometown clubs ''FC Ph\u00f6nix Mannheim'' and later for [[VfR Mannheim]]. He was quickly marked as a talented striker with a natural instinct for scoring goals.  Fueled by the desire to display his talents at a higher level, he signed with [[FC Bayern Munich]] in 1930.  In his first season with FC Bayern, Rohr and his teammates barely missed out on the final round of the German Championship.  In his second season with the club, FC Bayern went on to defeat [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in the final and claim its first German Championship with a 2\u20130 victory.  Ossi Rohr, who scored one of the two goals in the match against Eintracht, was German Champion at the young age of 20 years.  The following year, Bayern's fortunes were significantly poorer, resulting in a mid-table finish within [[Bavaria]].  This lackluster finish encouraged Rohr to continue his career elsewhere.\n\nAt the age of 19, Rohr received his first [[German national football team|German national team]] call-up by German manager [[Otto Nerz]].  There he found himself on the pitch with stars such as [[Ernst Kuzorra]] and [[Richard Hofmann]].  He played in a total of four national team matches through March 1933, receiving his first cap a year earlier against [[Swiss national football team|Switzerland]] (2\u20130) in March 1932. He later scored two goals in a 4\u20133 win against [[Swedish national football team|Sweden]], one goal in a 1\u20133 loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and two goals in a 3\u20133 draw with [[France national football team|France]]. With five goals in four matches,<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/orohr-intl.html | title = Oskar 'Ossi' Rohr - Goals in International Matches | first = Matthias | last = Arnhold | date = 25 August 2016 | accessdate = 26 August 2016 | publisher = [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]}}</ref> Rohr looked to be on the verge of a very successful national career.\n\n==Success Abroad==\nDuring the summer of 1933, Rohr transferred to [[Grasshoppers Z\u00fcrich]] in the [[Axpo Super League|Swiss League]], where he would go on to win the [[Swiss Cup]].  Although football results were important to him, Rohr's real mission was to earn a living playing football.  The pursuit of money convinced him to transfer to [[Ligue 1|French League]] side [[Racing Strasbourg]].  Due to his numerous transfers, football magazine \"Der Fu\u00dfball\" referred to Rohr as ''\"the Gladiator, whom sells himself abroad.\"\n\nThis antagonism towards Rohr only endeared him even more to the press and fans in the [[Alsace]].  During the 1934\u201335 season, he proved his worth scoring 20 goals in 22 matches while leading Strasbourg to runner-up in the French Championship.  The following season Rohr scored at an even higher rate, netting 28 goals in 28 matches.  This performance saw him end up second on the French goal scoring list, with Strasbourg finishing third in the league. Although only finishing 6th in the league during the 1936\u201337 season, Rohr did obtain a [[French Cup]] runners-up medal with Strasbourg, as well as becoming the French League scoring champion with 30 goals.  The following season he would finish again in second on the goal scoring list with 25 goals.  With 117 Ligue 1 goals, Rohr is still the all-time goal scorer at Racing Strasbourg.  He is still fondly remembered by fans of the club.\n\n==War Years==\nThe start of World War II in 1939, as well as the occupation of various parts of France by the German Army in 1940, troubled Rohr and he decided to flee to [[S\u00e8te]] in southern, unoccupied France where he live until 1942.  During this time, the [[Third Reich]] declared him [[Persona non grata]]. It is unknown if he played at local club FC S\u00e8te during this time period; he was however, not listed on the players roster during the 1941\u201342 season.  Additionally disputed is whether Rohr served as a member of the [[French Foreign Legion]] between 1940\u20131942.\n\nIn November 1942, he was sentenced to a three-month prison term after his arrest by French police in [[Marseille]] for \"anti-French or communist propaganda.\"  He was handed over to the authorities by his nephew, [[Philip Rohr]].  He served his sentence at the Strasbourg Citadel, after which he was handed over to German authorities.  The [[Gestapo]] interned him in a concentration camp at Karlsruhe-Kieslau; two months later he was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].  After arriving at the Eastern Front, Rohr was permitted to join a German Army football team, enabling him to perform the one task he truly enjoyed; scoring goals.  Shortly before the end of the war, a German pilot recognized him from his football days and offered him a flight back to Germany.\n\n==Post war==\nAfter the war ended, Rohr decided to remain in Germany instead of returning to Strasbourg.  Until  1949 he continued to play in the first division of German football (Oberliga S\u00fcd) for [[VfR Mannheim]] (1945\u201346, 7 matches, 3 goals), [[TSV Schwaben Augsburg]] (1945\u201346, 15 matches, 8 goals) and [[SV Waldhof Mannheim|SV Waldhof]] (1948\u201349, 17 matches, 5 goals) as well as for (Oberliga S\u00fcdwest) [[FK Pirmasens]] (1947\u201348, 21 matches, 11 goals). At VfR Rohr briefly played in the same side as his nephew [[Philipp Rohr|Philipp]].  After his retirement, he worked as a clerk for the Mannheim city prosecutors office.\n \n[[Gernot Rohr]], grandnephew of Oskar Rohr, would eventually also play for [[FC Bayern Munich|FC Bayern]] as well as in the French League with [[Girondins Bordeaux]]; Gernot even became a French citizen in 1982 and worked as a football manager until 2005 in the same country where his great uncle, Oskar Rohr, made his name as the greatest goal scorer of the 1930s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.spowo.net/index_news.php?Aktion=news_lesen&news_ID=1453&news_monat=04&news_jahr=2007/ Article in \"SportWoche\" (in German)]\n* {{Fussballdaten|rohroskar}}\n* {{WorldFootball.net|oskar-rohr}}\n* {{NFT player|id=17743}}\n\n{{Ligue 1 top scorers}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rohr, Oskar}}\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Mannheim]]\n[[Category:People from the Grand Duchy of Baden]]\n[[Category:German footballers]]\n[[Category:Germany international footballers]]\n[[Category:Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich players]]\n[[Category:FC Bayern Munich footballers]]\n[[Category:Ligue 1 players]]\n[[Category:RC Strasbourg Alsace players]]\n[[Category:FC S\u00e8te 34 players]]\n[[Category:German expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in France]]\n[[Category:SV Waldhof Mannheim players]]\n[[Category:Association football forwards]]\n[[Category:VfR Mannheim players]]\n[[Category:Footballers from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:FK Pirmasens players]]\n", "name_user": "S.A.
