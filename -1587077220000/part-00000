It bordered the [[Balochistan]] and [[Pashtunistan]] regions to the west, [[Kashmir]] to the north, the [[Hindi Belt]] to the east, and [[Rajasthan]] and [[Sindh]] to the south.\n\nThe people of the Punjab today are called [[Punjabis]], and their principal language is [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. The main religion of the Pakistani Punjab region is [[Islam]]. The main religion of the Indian Punjab region is [[Sikhism]]. Other religious groups are [[Christianity]], [[Jainism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Ravidassia]]. The Punjab region was the [[Cradle of civilization|cradle]] for the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. The region had numerous [[Indo-Aryan migration|migration]] by the [[Indo-Aryan peoples]].

But, in truth, that final word is never, to my knowledge, used by the Indians in proper names compounded in this way; on the other hand, there exist multiple Persian names which end with that word, e.g., ''Doab'' and ''Nilab''. Therefore it is probable that the name Penjab, which is today found in all geographical books, is of more recent origin and is to be attributed to the Muslim kings of India, among whom the Persian language was mostly in use. That the Indian name Panchanada is ancient and genuine is evident from the fact that it is already seen in the ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata'', the most ancient Indian poems, and that no other exists in addition to it among the Indians; for ''Panch\u00e1la'', which English translations of the ''Ramayana'' render with Penjab,&nbsp;... is the name of another region, entirely distinct from Pentapotamia, as we shall see below.|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XbBCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA3}}{{whose translation|reason=has several mistakes - looks like Google translation}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1-last=Latif|author1-first=Syad Muhammad|title=History of the Panj\u00e1b from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Time|year=1891|publisher=[[Calcultta Central Press Company]]|page=1|quote=The Panj\u00e1b, the Pentapotamia of the Greek historians, the north-western region of the empire of Hindost\u00e1n, derives its name from two Persian words, ''panj'' (five), an ''\u00e1b'' (water, having reference to the five rivers which confer on the country its distinguishing features.\" |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RzBAAQAAMAAJ&pg=PR1}}</ref><ref name=\"Khalid\">{{cite journal|author1-last=Khalid|author1-first=Kanwal|title=Lahore of Pre Historic Era|journal=Journal of the Research Society of Pakistan |volume=52|issue=2|page=73|year=2015|quote=The earliest mention of five rivers in the collective sense was found in Yajurveda and a word Panchananda was used, which is a Sanskrit word to describe a land where five rivers meet.

In 1758, Punjab came under the rule of [[Marathas]], who captured the region by defeating the Afghan forces of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]]. Following [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against Marathas, Durranis reconsolidated its power and dominion over the Punjab region, and Kashmir Valley. Abdali's Indian invasion weakened the Maratha influence. After the death of Ahmad Shah, the Punjab was freed from the Afghan rule by Sikhs for a brief period between 1773 and 1818.

Muslim empires ruled the Punjab for approximately 1,000 years. The period was also notable for the emergence of [[Guru Nanak]] (1469\u20131539), the founder of [[Sikhism]].\n\nThe Afghan forces of [[Durrani Empire]] also known as [[Durrani Empire|Afghan Empire]] under the command of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] entered Punjab in 1749, and captured Punjab, with Lahore being governed by [[Afghans|Pashtuns]], and Kashmir regions. In 1758, Punjab came under the rule of [[Marathas]], who captured the region by defeating the Afghan forces of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]]. Following [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against Marathas, Durranis reconsolidated its power and dominion over the Punjab region, and Kashmir Valley. Abdali's Indian invasion weakened the Maratha influence. After the death of Ahmad Shah, the Punjab was freed from the Afghan rule by Sikhs for a brief period between 1773 and 1818. At the time of the formation of the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]] in 1748 at [[Amritsar]], the Punjab had been divided into 36 areas and 12 separate Sikh principalities, called [[misl]]. From this point onward, the beginnings of a Punjabi [[Sikh Empire]] emerged. Out of the 36 areas, 22 were united by [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]].

Both east and west Punjab produce a relatively high proportion of India and Pakistan's food output respectively.\n\nThe region has been used for extensive wheat farming. In addition, rice, cotton, [[sugarcane]], fruit, and vegetables are also grown.\n\nThe agricultural output of the Punjab region in Pakistan contributes significantly to Pakistan's GDP. Both Indian and Pakistani Punjab are considered to have the best infrastructure of their respective countries. Indian Punjab has been estimated to be the second richest state in India.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-04-08/chandigarh/28336153_1_northern-states-capita-income-total-software-exports \"Punjab second richest state in country: CII\"], ''The Times of India'', 8 April 2004.</ref> Pakistani Punjab produces 68% of Pakistan's food grain production.<ref>[http://www.infopak.gov.pk/punjab.aspx Pakistani government statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308122328/http://www.infopak.gov.pk/punjab.aspx |date=8 March 2007 }}.

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Fitzgerald tried to continue working on his fourth novel, but by this point it had become clear that Zelda had an extreme mental illness as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. By 1930 she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. Fitzgerald had her treated at [[Prangins clinic]] in [[Switzerland]] They returned to America in September 1931.<ref name=\"life_of_fitzgerald\"/> But once again, February 1932, she was hospitalized at the Phipps Clinic at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_f_scott_fitzgerald_in_baltimore/|title = F.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Scott and Zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in January of the following year and Fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with [[Lois Moran]].

His short story, ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', was the basis for a [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|2008 film]]. ''Tender Is the Night'' was the subject of the [[Tender Is the Night (film)|eponymous 1962 film]], and made into a television miniseries in 1985. ''The Beautiful and Damned'' was filmed in [[The Beautiful and Damned (film)|1922]] and 2010.

His main interest was [[demography]], which possibly influenced his professional choice as a [[statistician]] at [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company|Metropolitan Life Insurance]].\n\nOne of Lotka's earliest publications, in 1912, proposed a solution to [[Ronald Ross]]'s second [[malaria]] model. In 1923, he published a thorough five-part analysis and extension of both Ross's malaria models. The fourth part in the series, co-authored by F. R. Sharpe, modeled the time lag for pathogen incubation. Lotka published ''Elements of Physical Biology'' in 1925, one of the first books on [[mathematical biology]] after [[D'Arcy Thompson]]'s ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. He is also known for his [[energetics]] perspective on [[evolution]]. Lotka proposed that [[natural selection]] was, at its root, a struggle among organisms for available energy; [[Lotka's principle]] states that organisms that survive and prosper are those that capture and use [[energy]] more efficiently than its competitors. Lotka extended his energetics framework to human society. In particular, he suggested that the shift in reliance from [[solar energy]] to nonrenewable energy would pose unique and fundamental challenges to society. These theories made Lotka an important forerunner to the development of [[biophysical economics]] and [[ecological economics]], advanced by [[Frederick Soddy]], [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] and others.<ref>Cleveland, Cutler (Lead Author); Peter Saundry (Topic Editor). 2008. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Lotka,_Alfred_James \"Lotka, Alfred James\"].

First published in the Encyclopedia of Earth September 15, 2006; Last revised December 1, 2008; Retrieved August 3, 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Elements of physical biology ===\nWhile at Johns Hopkins, Lotka completed his book ''Elements of Physical Biology'' (1925), in which he extended the work of [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst]]. His first book summarizes his previous work and organizes his ideas of unity and universality of physical laws, making his works accessible to other scientists. Although the book covered a large amount of topics, from energetics of evolution (see below) to the physical nature of consciousness, the author is primarily known today for the [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation]] of population dynamics.<!--this and the next section seem the right and sensible structure here, but much of their thunder has been stolen by the overlong introduction just above: needs reorg to reduce repetition-->\n\n===Energetics of evolution===\nHis earlier work was centered on energetics and applications of [[thermodynamics]] in [[life sciences]].\n\nLotka proposed the theory that the [[Darwinian]] concept of [[natural selection]] could be quantified as a physical law. The law that he proposed was that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. The general systems ecologist [[Howard T. Odum]] later applied Lotka's proposal as a central guiding feature of his work in [[ecosystem ecology]]. Odum called Lotka's law the [[maximum power principle]].\n\n===Demography and public health===\nLotka's work in mathematical demography began in 1907 with the publication of articles in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[American Journal of Science]]''. He published several dozen articles on the subject over more than two decades, culminating with ''Th\u00e9orie Analytique des Associations Biologiques'' (Analytical Theory of Biological Associations). The 45-page Part 1, titled ''Principes'', was published in 1934; the 149-page Part 2, titled ''Analyse demographique avec application particuliere a l'espece humaine'', was published in 1939; both by [[\u00c9ditions Hermann|Hermann & Cie]], Paris.\n\n===Bibliometrics===\nWithin the field of bibliometrics, particularly that part devoted to studying scientific publications, Lotka is noted for contributing \"[[Lotka's law]]\". The law, which Lotka discovered, relates to the productivity of scientists. As noted by W. G. Poitier in 1981: \"The Lotka distribution is based on an inverse square law where the number of authors writing ''n'' papers is 1/''n''<sup>2</sup> of the number of authors writing one paper.

His main interest was [[demography]], which possibly influenced his professional choice as a [[statistician]] at [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company|Metropolitan Life Insurance]].\n\nOne of Lotka's earliest publications, in 1912, proposed a solution to [[Ronald Ross]]'s second [[malaria]] model. In 1923, he published a thorough five-part analysis and extension of both Ross's malaria models. The fourth part in the series, co-authored by F. R. Sharpe, modeled the time lag for pathogen incubation. Lotka published ''Elements of Physical Biology'' in 1925, one of the first books on [[mathematical biology]] after [[D'Arcy Thompson]]'s ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. He is also known for his [[energetics]] perspective on [[evolution]]. Lotka proposed that [[natural selection]] was, at its root, a struggle among organisms for available energy; [[Lotka's principle]] states that organisms that survive and prosper are those that capture and use [[energy]] more efficiently than its competitors. Lotka extended his energetics framework to human society. In particular, he suggested that the shift in reliance from [[solar energy]] to nonrenewable energy would pose unique and fundamental challenges to society. These theories made Lotka an important forerunner to the development of [[biophysical economics]] and [[ecological economics]], advanced by [[Frederick Soddy]], [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] and others.<ref>Cleveland, Cutler (Lead Author); Peter Saundry (Topic Editor). 2008. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Lotka,_Alfred_James \"Lotka, Alfred James\"].

His first book summarizes his previous work and organizes his ideas of unity and universality of physical laws, making his works accessible to other scientists. Although the book covered a large amount of topics, from energetics of evolution (see below) to the physical nature of consciousness, the author is primarily known today for the [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation]] of population dynamics.<!--this and the next section seem the right and sensible structure here, but much of their thunder has been stolen by the overlong introduction just above: needs reorg to reduce repetition-->\n\n===Energetics of evolution===\nHis earlier work was centered on energetics and applications of [[thermodynamics]] in [[life sciences]].\n\nLotka proposed the theory that the [[Darwinian]] concept of [[natural selection]] could be quantified as a physical law. The law that he proposed was that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. The general systems ecologist [[Howard T. Odum]] later applied Lotka's proposal as a central guiding feature of his work in [[ecosystems]] [[ecology]]. Odum called Lotka's law the [[maximum power principle]].\n\n===Demography and public health===\nLotka's work in mathematical demography began in 1907 with the publication of articles in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[American Journal of Science]]''. He published several dozen articles on the subject over more than two decades, culminating with ''Th\u00e9orie Analytique des Associations Biologiques'' (Analytical Theory of Biological Associations). The 45-page Part 1, titled ''Principes'', was published in 1934; the 149-page Part 2, titled ''Analyse demographique avec application particuliere a l'espece humaine'', was published in 1939; both by [[\u00c9ditions Hermann|Hermann & Cie]], Paris.\n\n===Bibliometrics===\nWithin the field of bibliometrics, particularly that part devoted to studying scientific publications, Lotka is noted for contributing \"[[Lotka's law]]\". The law, which Lotka discovered, relates to the productivity of scientists. As noted by W. G. Poitier in 1981: \"The Lotka distribution is based on an inverse square law where the number of authors writing ''n'' papers is 1/''n''<sup>2</sup> of the number of authors writing one paper. Each subject area can have associated with it an exponent representing its specific rate of author productivity.\" Lotka's work sparked additional inquiries, eventually seminally contributing to the field of [[scientometrics]]\u2014the scientific study of scientific publications.\n\nHe teamed up with [[Louis Israel Dublin]], another statistician at Metropolitan Life, to write three books on demography and [[public health]]: ''The Money Value of a Man'' (1930), ''Length of Life'' (1936), and ''Twenty-five Years of Health Progress'' (1937).\n\n==Honors==\n*President of the [[Population Association of America]] (1938\u20131939)<ref name=Smith/>\n*President of the [[American Statistical Association]] (1942)<ref name=Smith/>\n*Vice president of the [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3070046 Union for the Scientific Investigation of Population Problems]\n*Chairman of the [[United States National Committee of the Union]]\n*Fellow of [[American Public Health Association]]\n*Fellow of [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations]] (for predation)\n* [[Lotka\u2013Volterra inter-specific competition equations]]\n* [[Lotka's law]] (a special case of [[Zipf's law]])\n* [[Euler\u2013Lotka equation]]\n* [[Energy accounting]]\n* [[Biophysical economics]]\n* [[Bioeconomics (biophysical)|Bioeconomics]]\n* [[Energy economics]]\n* [[Howard T.

Barnwell was the [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|349th]] [[bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. He was also the first president of what is now [[Boise State University]].\n\n==Life==\nMiddleton S. Barnwell was born September 9, 1882 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. He was graduated from [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]], with an associate degree and earned his Bachelor's in Divinity and later honorary doctorate from the Episcopal [[Virginia Theological Seminary]]. Barnwell served as the assistant rector at Christ Chapel in [[Baltimore]] in 1909. In 1911, he became rector of St. Andrew's Church in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. While serving St. Andrew's, Barnwell married Margaret Thorne Lighthall (1889\u20131960).<ref name=\"finearts\">[http://finearts.boisestate.edu/content/pioneersarticle.cfm?article_id=45 Boise State University: Bishop Barnwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609174403/http://finearts.boisestate.edu/content/pioneersarticle.cfm?article_id=45 |date=2010-06-09 }}</ref>\n\nHe worked at the Church of the Advent in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], from 1913 to 1923. Barnwell then became field secretary to the Protestant Episcopal Church and then was consecrated Bishop of [[Idaho]] in 1925.\n\nDuring this time in the late 1920s and early 30s, Bishop Barnwell ran St. Margaret's School, a secondary girls' academy in [[Boise, Idaho]]. With the Depression, more girls began to attend public school. Bishop Barnwell advocated that the academy become a junior college so that local high school graduates could begin their college education without out-of-state costs. In February, 1932, he began working to form a junior college out of St. Margaret's. While he found no local support, Barnwell did secure funding from The Episcopal Church. September 6, 1932, [[Boise Junior College]] opened its doors to about 75 students and fourteen faculty members (eight of whom were full-time).<ref name=\"finearts\"/> He told its first graduates,<blockquote>All achievement begins in vision and continues through labor and through faith which is the most misunderstood word in the English language. Faith is not believing something you can't prove, faith is seeing something which is as yet invisible. And that's the sort of faith which we began this school.</blockquote>Bishop Barnwell served as the college's president from 1932 until 1934. At that time he recommended that Boise Junior College become a public institution. The school is now [[Boise State University]].\n\nBarnwell had served in as Bishop of Idaho for nearly a decade when the call for a bishop coadjutor went out from the Diocese of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The election of a successor to [[Frederick F. Reese|Bishop F. F. Reese]] took two conventions to be decided. On August 30, 1934, a special convention was held at Grace Church, [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]] and failed in twelve ballots to elect a new bishop. A second session met January 15, 1935 at St. Paul's, [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and took nine more ballots to elect Barnwell as  the fifth Bishop of the Diocese of Georgia.\n\nAt the time of his election, there were 16 parishes, 21 organized missions, 13 unorganized missions, five mission stations and one parochial mission. The still segregated church records noted 5,391 white and 1,029 black communicants. During his tenure as bishop, which lasted until 1954 the Diocese grew to 8,156 total communicants with two more churches becoming parishes and four additional missions created.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Episcopal Church in Georgia 1733\u20131957, by Henry Thomas Malone, published by The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Atlanta, 1960</ref>\n\nOn the 10th year of his consecration as bishop of Georgia, he told the Diocese<blockquote> The happiest and most useful relationship for a Bishop or Priest is that of Friend to his people. It means trust\u2014and service\u2014and love. And beyond this there is nothing else.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote> He served as Bishop of Georgia from 1936 to 1954.\n\nOn the occasion of his retirement he said of serving as bishop that a bishop needed, \"robust health and a good driving ability\" and for a large diocese like Georgia one should be \"either celibate, or a man who is very unhappily married...for he will live on the highway.\" He went on to speak of \"relentless weekends\" visiting the scattered churches of the Diocese and \"in between he tries to make friends with his wife and others who live in his home town.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He died in Savannah on May 6, 1957. Bishop Barnwell and his wife Maggie had no children. She died in 1960. The couple is buried at Savannah's Bonaventure cemetery.\n\nHe was succeeded by [[Albert R.

Barnwell was the [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|349th]] [[bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. He was also the first president of what is now [[Boise State University]].\n\n==Life==\nMiddleton S. Barnwell was born September 9, 1882 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. He was graduated from [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]], with an associate degree and earned his Bachelor's in Divinity and later honorary doctorate from the Episcopal [[Virginia Theological Seminary]]. Barnwell served as the assistant rector at Christ Chapel in [[Baltimore]] in 1909. In 1911, he became rector of St. Andrew's Church in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. While serving St. Andrew's, Barnwell married Margaret Thorne Lighthall (1889\u20131960).<ref name=\"finearts\">[http://finearts.boisestate.edu/content/pioneersarticle.cfm?article_id=45 Boise State University: Bishop Barnwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609174403/http://finearts.boisestate.edu/content/pioneersarticle.cfm?article_id=45 |date=2010-06-09 }}</ref>\n\nHe worked at the Church of the Advent in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], from 1913 to 1923. Barnwell then became field secretary to the Protestant Episcopal Church and then was consecrated Bishop of [[Idaho]] in 1925.\n\nDuring this time in the late 1920s and early 30s, Bishop Barnwell ran St. Margaret's School, a secondary girls' academy in [[Boise, Idaho]]. With the Depression, more girls began to attend public school. Bishop Barnwell advocated that the academy become a junior college so that local high school graduates could begin their college education without out-of-state costs. In February, 1932, he began working to form a junior college out of St. Margaret's. While he found no local support, Barnwell did secure funding from The Episcopal Church. September 6, 1932, [[Boise Junior College]] opened its doors to about 75 students and fourteen faculty members (eight of whom were full-time).<ref name=\"finearts\"/> He told its first graduates,<blockquote>All achievement begins in vision and continues through labor and through faith which is the most misunderstood word in the English language. Faith is not believing something you can't prove, faith is seeing something which is as yet invisible. And that's the sort of faith which we began this school.</blockquote>Bishop Barnwell served as the college's president from 1932 until 1934. At that time he recommended that Boise Junior College become a public institution. The school is now [[Boise State University]].\n\nBarnwell had served in as Bishop of Idaho for nearly a decade when the call for a bishop coadjutor went out from the Diocese of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The election of a successor to [[Frederick F. Reese|Bishop F. F. Reese]] took two conventions to be decided. On August 30, 1934, a special convention was held at Grace Church, [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]] and failed in twelve ballots to elect a new bishop. A second session met January 15, 1935 at St. Paul's, [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and took nine more ballots to elect Barnwell as  the fifth Bishop of the Diocese of Georgia.\n\nAt the time of his election, there were 16 parishes, 21 organized missions, 13 unorganized missions, five mission stations and one parochial mission. The still segregated church records noted 5,391 white and 1,029 black communicants. During his tenure as bishop, which lasted until 1954 the Diocese grew to 8,156 total communicants with two more churches becoming parishes and four additional missions created.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Episcopal Church in Georgia 1733\u20131957, by Henry Thomas Malone, published by The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Atlanta, 1960</ref>\n\nOn the 10th year of his consecration as bishop of Georgia, he told the Diocese<blockquote> The happiest and most useful relationship for a Bishop or Priest is that of Friend to his people. It means trust\u2014and service\u2014and love. And beyond this there is nothing else.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/></blockquote> He served as Bishop of Georgia from 1936 to 1954.\n\nOn the occasion of his retirement he said of serving as bishop that a bishop needed, \"robust health and a good driving ability\" and for a large diocese like Georgia one should be \"either celibate, or a man who is very unhappily married...for he will live on the highway.\" He went on to speak of \"relentless weekends\" visiting the scattered churches of the Diocese and \"in between he tries to make friends with his wife and others who live in his home town.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He died in Savannah on May 6, 1957. Bishop Barnwell and his wife Maggie had no children. She died in 1960. The couple is buried at Savannah's Bonaventure cemetery.\n\nHe was succeeded by [[Albert R. Stuart]] as Bishop of Georgia.\n\n==References and sources==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*The Episcopal Church in Georgia 1733\u20131957, by Henry Thompson Malone published by The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Atlanta, 1960\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.honeycreek.org/ Honey Creek, the Camp and Conference Center of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia] has a Barnwell wing to the camp's lodge in honor of the Rt.

Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18 plus extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 18, and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical Edwards syndrome.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Ultrasound]] can increase suspicion for the condition, which can be confirmed by [[amniocentesis]].<ref name=Or2008/>\n\nLevels of PAPP-A, AFP, uE3, free \u03b2-hCG, all of which are generally decreased during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lab-lamartine.pt/website/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=133&Itemid=392 |title=Prenatal Diagnose |url-status=dead |access-date=2018-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817055837/http://www.lab-lamartine.pt/website/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=133&Itemid=392 |archive-date=2018-08-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nAbout 95% of pregnancies that are affected do not result in a live birth.<ref name=\"emed\" /> Major causes of death include [[apnea]] and heart abnormalities.

The additional chromosome usually occurs before [[Fertilisation|conception]]. The effects of the extra copy vary greatly, depending on the extent of the extra copy, genetic history, and chance. Edwards syndrome occurs in all human populations, but is more prevalent in female offspring.<ref name=\"emed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic652.htm#section~Introduction|title=Introduction to Trisomy 18|last=Chen, MD|first=Harold|publisher=EMedicine|accessdate=2008-07-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804190753/http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic652.htm#section~Introduction|archivedate=2008-08-04}}</ref>\n\nA healthy egg and/or sperm cell contains individual chromosomes, each of which contributes to the 23 pairs of chromosomes needed to form a normal cell with a typical human [[karyotype]] of 46 chromosomes. Numerical errors can arise at either of the two [[meiotic]] divisions and cause the failure of a chromosome to segregate into the daughter cells ([[nondisjunction]]). This results in an extra chromosome, making the [[haploid]] number 24 rather than 23. Fertilization of eggs or insemination by sperm that contain an extra chromosome results in trisomy, or three copies of a chromosome rather than two.<ref>For a description of human karyotype see {{cite web|editor=Mittleman, A. |year=1995 |url=http://www.iscn1995.org/ |title=An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature |accessdate=2006-06-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707183834/http://www.iscn1995.org/ |archivedate=2006-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTrisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) is caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event. With nondisjunction, a [[gamete]] (''i.e.'', a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 18; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the [[embryo]] has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 18.\n\nA small percentage of cases occur when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy of chromosome 18, resulting in a mixed population of cells with a differing number of chromosomes. Such cases are sometimes called [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] Edwards syndrome. Very rarely, a piece of chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or after conception. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18 plus extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 18, and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical Edwards syndrome.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Ultrasound]] can increase suspicion for the condition, which can be confirmed by [[amniocentesis]].<ref name=Or2008/>\n\nLevels of PAPP-A, AFP, uE3, free \u03b2-hCG, all of which are generally decreased during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lab-lamartine.pt/website/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=133&Itemid=392 |title=Prenatal Diagnose |url-status=dead |access-date=2018-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817055837/http://www.lab-lamartine.pt/website/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=133&Itemid=392 |archive-date=2018-08-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nAbout 95% of pregnancies that are affected do not result in a live birth.<ref name=\"emed\" /> Major causes of death include [[apnea]] and heart abnormalities.
