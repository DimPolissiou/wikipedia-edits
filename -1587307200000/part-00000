By that period, pikemen would primarily defend their unit's [[musketeer]]s from enemy cavalry.]]\n\nA '''pike''' is a [[pole weapon]], a very long thrusting [[spear]] formerly used extensively by [[infantry]]. Pikes were used regularly in European warfare from the [[Late Middle Ages]]{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=151}} to the early 18th century, and were wielded by foot soldiers deployed in close quarters, until their replacement by the [[bayonet]]. The pike found extensive use with [[Landsknecht]] armies and [[Swiss mercenaries]], who employed it as their main weapon and used it in [[pike square]] formations. A similar weapon, the [[sarissa]], was also used by [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[phalanx]] infantry to great effect. Generally, a spear becomes a pike when it is too long to be wielded with one hand in combat.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Pike square img 3655.jpg|thumb|Re-enactment during the 2009 Escalade in Geneva.]]\nThe pike was a long weapon, varying considerably in size, from {{convert|3|to|7.5|m|0|abbr=off}} long. It was approximately {{convert|2.5|-|6|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, with sixteenth-century military writer Sir John Smythe recommending lighter rather than heavier pikes.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Everything you ever wanted to know about Pikes but were afraid to ask... |url=http://www.renaissancewarfare.com/1_4_Pike.html |publisher= |date= |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> It had a wooden shaft with an iron or steel spearhead affixed. The shaft near the head was often reinforced with metal strips called \"cheeks\" or langets. When the troops of opposing armies both carried the pike, it often grew in a sort of [[arms race]], getting longer in both shaft and head length to give one side's pikemen an edge in combat.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The extreme length of such weapons required a strong wood such as well-seasoned ash for the pole, which was tapered towards the point to prevent the pike from sagging on the ends, although drooping or slight flection of the shaft was always a problem in pike handling. It is a common mistake to refer to a bladed polearm as a pike; such weapons are more generally [[halberd]]s, [[glaive]]s or [[voulge]]s.\n\nThe great length of the pikes allowed a great concentration of spearheads to be presented to the enemy, with their wielders at a greater distance, but also made pikes unwieldy in close combat. This meant that pikemen had to be equipped with an additional, shorter weapon such as a [[dagger]] or [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] in order to defend themselves should the fighting degenerate into a [[melee]]. In general, however, pikemen attempted to avoid such disorganized combat, in which they were at a disadvantage. To compound their difficulties in a melee, the pikeman often did not have a shield, or had only a small shield which would be of limited use in close-quarters fighting.\n\n==Tactics==\n[[File:Pike square img 3645.jpg|thumb|First rank with pikes at \"charge for horse\" static defensive posture, ready to draw swords if needed. Second rank holding their pikes at \"charge\" for delivering thrusts.]]\n[[File:Pike square img 3653.jpg|thumb|First rank with pikes at \"charge\", second rank holding pikes at \"port\". In real action first 3 - 4 ranks will hold their pikes at \"charge\" (their points projecting forward from the formation front), and those behind will hold weapons at \"port\" (to avoid injuring front rank friendlies with their points).]]\n\nThe pike, being unwieldy, was typically used in a deliberate, defensive manner, often alongside other missile and [[melee weapon]]s. However, better-trained troops were capable of using the pike in an aggressive attack with each rank of pikemen being trained to hold their pikes so that they presented enemy infantry with four or five layers of spearheads bristling from the front of the formation.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nAs long as it kept good order, such a formation could roll right over enemy infantry but it did have weaknesses. The men were all moving forward facing in a single direction and could not turn quickly or efficiently to protect the vulnerable flanks or rear of the formation. Nor could they maintain cohesion over uneven ground, as the Scots discovered to their cost at the [[Battle of Flodden]]. The huge block of men carrying such unwieldy spears could be difficult to maneuver in any way other than straightforward movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nAs a result, such mobile pike formations sought to have supporting troops protect their flanks or would maneuver to smash the enemy before they could be outflanked themselves. There was also the risk that the formation would become disordered, leading to a confused melee in which pikemen had the vulnerabilities mentioned above.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nAccording to Sir John Smythe, there were two ways for two opposing pike formations to confront one another: cautious or aggressive. The cautious approach involved fencing at the length of the pike, while the aggressive approach involved quickly closing distance, with each of the first five ranks giving a single powerful thrust. In the aggressive approach, the first rank would then immediately resort to swords and daggers if the thrusts from the first five ranks failed to break the opposing pike formation. Smythe considered the cautious approach laughable.{{sfn|''Art Military''|2011}}\n\nAlthough primarily a military weapon, the pike could be surprisingly effective in single combat and a number of 16th-century sources explain how it was to be used in a dueling situation; fencers of the time often practiced with and competed against each other with long staves in place of pikes. George Silver considered the {{convert|18|ft|m}} pike one of the more advantageous weapons for single combat in the open, giving it odds over all weapons shorter than {{convert|8|ft|m}} or the sword and dagger/shield combination.{{sfn|Silver|1599}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient Europe===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Makedonische phalanx.png|thumb|[[Macedonian phalanx]]]]\n{{main|Sarissa}}\nAlthough very long spears had been used since the dawn of organized warfare (notably illustrated in art showing Sumerian and Minoan warriors and hunters), the earliest recorded use of a pike-like weapon in the tactical method described above involved the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] sarissa, used by the troops of [[Alexander the Great]]'s father, [[Philip II of Macedon]], and successive dynasties, which dominated warfare for several centuries in many countries. <!-- As \"pike\" is a European name for this type of weapon, this page focuses on the use of the pike in Europe. Pikes were also probably used for hunting and fishing. For more information on its classical usage in the Hellenistic world, see the entry for [[sarissa]].-->\n\nAfter the fall of the last successor of Macedon, the pike largely fell out of use for the next 1000 or so years. The one exception to this appears to have been in Germany, where [[Tacitus]] recorded Germanic tribesmen in the 2nd century AD as using \"over-long spears\". He consistently refers to the spears used by the Germans as being \"massive\" and \"very long\" suggesting that he is describing in essence a pike. [[Caesar]], in his [[De Bello Gallico]], describes the [[Helvetii]] as fighting in a tight, phalanx-like formation with spears jutting out over their shields. Caesar was probably describing an early form of the [[shieldwall]] so popular in later times.\n\n===Medieval Europe revival===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the principal users of the pike were urban militia troops such as the [[Flemings]] or the peasant array of the lowland [[Scottish people|Scots]]. For example, the Scots used a spear formation known as the ''[[schiltron]]'' in several battles during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] including the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, and the Flemings used their ''geldon'' long spear to absorb the attack of French knights at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302, before other troops in the Flemish formation counterattacked the stalled knights with [[goedendag]]s. Both battles were seen by contemporaries as stunning victories of commoners over superbly equipped, mounted, military professionals, where victory was owed to the use of the pike and the brave resistance of the commoners who wielded them.\n\nThese formations were essentially immune to the attacks of mounted men-at-arms as long as the knights obligingly threw themselves on the spear wall and the foot soldiers remained steady under the morale challenge of facing a cavalry charge, but the closely packed nature of pike formations rendered them vulnerable to enemy archers and crossbowmen who could shoot them down with impunity, especially when the pikemen did not have adequate armor. Many defeats, such as at [[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke]] and [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]], were suffered by the militia pike armies when faced by cunning foes who employed their archers and crossbowmen to thin the ranks of the pike blocks before charging in with their (often dismounted) men-at-arms.\n\n[[File:Schlacht bei Dorneck.jpg|thumb|Contemporary woodcut of the [[Battle of Dornach]].]] \nMedieval pike formations tended to have better success when they operated in an aggressive fashion. The Scots at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] (1297), for example, utilized the momentum of their charge to overrun an English army while the Englishmen were crossing a narrow bridge. At the [[Battle of Laupen]] (1339), [[Bern]]ese pikemen overwhelmed the infantry forces of the opposing Habsburg/Burgundian army with a massive charge before wheeling over to strike and rout the Austro-Burgundian horsemen as well. At the same time however such aggressive action required considerable tactical cohesiveness or suitable terrain to protect the vulnerable flanks of the pike formations especially from the attack of mounted [[man-at-arms]], when these features not available Medieval militia pikes often suffered costly failures such as at Battles of [[Battle of Mons-en-Pevele|Mons-en-Pevele]] (1304), [[Battle of Cassel (1328)|Cassel]] (1328), [[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke]] (1382) and [[Battle of Oth\u00e9e|Othee]] (1408). The constant success of the [[Swiss mercenaries]] in the later period was attributed to their extreme discipline and tactical unity due to semi-professional nature, allowing a pike block to somewhat alleviate the threat presented by flanking attacks.\n\nIt was not uncommon for aggressive pike formations to be composed of dismounted [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], as at the [[Battle of Sempach]] (1386), where the dismounted Austrian vanguard, using their lances as pikes, had some initial success against their predominantly [[halberd]]-equipped Swiss adversaries. Dismounted Italian men-at-arms also used the same method to defeat the Swiss at the [[Battle of Arbedo]] (1422). Equally, well-armored Scottish nobles (accompanied even by King [[James IV]]) were recorded as forming the leading ranks of Scottish pike blocks at the [[Battle of Flodden]], incidentally rendering the whole formation resistant to English archery.\n\n===Renaissance Europe heyday===\n[[File:Bad-war.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss]] and [[Landsknecht]] pikemen fight at \"[[push of pike]]\" during the [[Italian Wars]].]]\n[[File:Slag om Grolle 2008-1 - Een eenheid piekeniers doet exercities bij de kampementen.jpg|thumb|Pikemen exercising during the [[Battle of Grolle]].]]\n\nThe [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss]] solved the pike's earlier problems and brought a renaissance to pike warfare in the 15th century, establishing strong training regimens to ensure they were masters of handling the ''Spiess'' (the German term for \"skewer\") on maneuvers and in combat; they also introduced marching to drums for this purpose. This meant that the pike blocks could rise to the attack, making them less passive and more aggressive formations, but sufficiently well trained that they could go on the defensive when attacked by cavalry. German soldiers known as [[Landsknecht]]s later adopted Swiss methods of pike handling.\n\nThe [[Scottish people|Scots]] predominantly used shorter spears in their [[schiltron]] formation; their attempt to adopt the longer Continental pike was dropped for general use after its ineffective use led to humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Flodden]].\n\nSuch Swiss and Landsknecht phalanxes also contained men armed with two-handed swords, or ''[[Zweih\u00e4nder]]'', and [[halberd]]iers for close combat against both infantry and attacking cavalry.\n\nThe Swiss were confronted with the German ''Landsknecht'' who used similar tactics as the Swiss, but more pikes in the more difficult ''deutschen Stoss'' (holding a pike that had its weight in the lower 1/3 at the end with two hands), which was utilized in a more flexible attacking column.\n\nThe high military reputation of the Swiss and the ''Landsknechts'' again led to the employment of mercenary units across Europe in order to train other armies in their tactics. These two, and others who had adopted their tactics, faced off in several wars, leading to a series of developments as a result.{{sfn|Schaufelberger|1987|date=November 2017}}\n\nThese formations had great successes on the battlefield, starting with the astonishing victories of the [[Swiss cantons]] against [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in the [[Burgundian Wars]], in which the Swiss participated in 1476 and 1477. In the battles of [[Battle of Grandson|Grandson]], [[Battle of Morat|Morat]] and [[Battle of Nancy|Nancy]], the Swiss not only successfully resisted the attacks of enemy knights, as the relatively passive Scottish and Flemish infantry squares had done in the earlier Middle Ages, but also marched to the attack with great speed and in good formation, their attack columns steamrolling the Burgundian forces, sometimes with great massacre.\n\nThe deep pike attack column remained the primary form of effective infantry combat for the next forty years, and the [[Swabian War]] saw the first conflict in which both sides had large formations of well-trained pikemen. After that war, its combatants\u2014the Swiss (thereafter generally serving as [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenaries]]) and their Landsknecht imitators\u2014would often face each other again in the [[Italian Wars]], which would become in many ways the military proving ground of the Renaissance.\n\n===Ancient China===\nPikes and long halberds were in use in ancient China from the [[Warring States period]] since the 5th century BC. Infantrymen used a variety of long polearm weapons, but the most popular was the [[dagger-axe]], pike-like long spear, and the [[ji (polearm)|''ji'']]. The dagger-axe and ''ji'' came in various lengths, from 9 to 18 feet; the weapon consisted of a thrusting spear with a slashing blade appended to it. Dagger-axes and ''ji'' were an extremely popular weapon in various kingdoms, especially for the Qin state and [[Qin Dynasty]], and possibly the succeeding Han Dynasty, who produced 18-foot-long halberd and pike-like weapons, as well as 22 foot long pikes during the [[Han-Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]].By the Song dynasty, pikes around 3 meters long were standard issue for infantry all the way until the Republic of China''An Army Reborn'' (Terracotta Army) Documentary Video (August 12, 2017) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctoDUdpRwzM]</ref>\n\n===Classical Japan===\nDuring the continuous European development of the pike, Japan experienced a parallel evolution of pole weapons.\n\nIn [[History of Japan|Classical Japan]], the Japanese style of warfare was generally fast-moving and aggressive, with far shallower formations than their European equivalents. The [[naginata]] and [[yari]] were more commonly used than swords for Japanese [[ashigaru]] foot soldiers and dismounted [[samurai]] due to their greater reach. Naginata, first used around 750 AD, had curved sword-like blades on wooden shafts with often spiked metal counterweights. They were typically used with a slashing action and forced the introduction of [[Suneate|shin guards]] as cavalry battles became more important. Yari were spears of varying lengths; their straight blades usually had sharpened edges or protrusions from the central blade, and were fitted to a hollowed shaft with an extremely long tang.\n\n===Medieval Japan===\nDuring the later half of the 16th century in [[History of Japan|Medieval Japan]], pikes used were generally {{convert|4.5|to|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, but sometimes up to 10 meters in length. By this point pikemen were becoming the main forces in armies. They formed lines, combined with [[arquebusier]]s and [[spearmen]]. Formations were generally only two or three rows deep.\n\nTrans-Atlantic armies appear to have possessed spears of pike dimensions, but in the absence for most of their existence of any cavalry threat did not develop the same traditions of massed close-order pike formations.\n\nThe rise of [[firearms]] and [[artillery]] in the 16th century made the large formations consisting entirely of pikemen vulnerable to being shot down despite their close-combat power. The decline of the combat column of pikemen was starkly displayed at the terrible [[Battle of Bicocca]] in 1522, for instance, where arquebusiers contributed to the heavy defeat of a force of Swiss pikemen.\n\n==Pike and shot==\n[[File:BourtangeExerzieren2010.ogg|thumb|right|250px|A re-enactment of the [[Thirty Years' War]] with Pikiner training at the [[Bourtange]] [[star fort]].]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Italian Wars, from the end of the 15th century to the late 16th century, most European armies adopted the use of the pike, often in conjunction with primitive firearms such as the [[arquebus]] and [[caliver]], to form large pike and shot formations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nThe quintessential example of this development was the Spanish [[Tercio]], which consisted of a large square of pikemen with small, mobile squadrons of arquebusiers moving along its perimeter, as well as traditional men-at-arms. These three elements formed a mutually supportive combination of tactical roles: the arquebusiers harried the enemy line, the pikemen protected the arquebusiers from enemy cavalry charges, and the men-at-arms, typically armed with swords and javelins, fought off enemy pikemen when two opposing squares made contact. The Tercio deployed smaller numbers of pikemen than the huge Swiss and Landsknecht columns, and their formation ultimately proved to be much more flexible on the battlefield.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nMixed formations of men quickly became the norm for European infantrymen, with many, but not all, seeking to imitate the Tercio; in England, a combination of [[bill (weapon)|bill]]men, [[longbow]]men, and men-at-arms remained the norm, though this changed when the supply of [[yew]] on the island dwindled.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nThe percentage of men who were armed with firearms in Tercio-like formations steadily increased as firearms advanced in technology. This advance is believed to be the demise of cavalry when in fact it revived it. In the late sixteenth into the 17th century, smaller pike formations were used, invariably defending attached musketeers, often as a central block with two sub-units of shooters, called \"sleeves of shot\", on either side of the pikes. Although the cheaper and versatile infantry increasingly adopted firearms, cavalry's proportion in the army remained high.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651) the [[New Model Army]] (1646\u20131660) initially had two musketeers for each pikeman.{{sfn|Firth|1972|p=70}} By about 1650 the New Model Army had all but stopped using pikemen. One of the advantages that the New Model Army gained by this was mobility\u2014musketeers who wore no armour marched on average about {{convert|15|mi|km}} a day which was about {{convert|3\u20135|mi|km}} more than pikemen could manage.{{sfn|Carpenter|2005|p=53}}\n\nTwo musketeers for each pikeman was not the agreed mix used throughout Europe, and when in 1658 [[Oliver Cromwell]], by then the [[Lord Protector (Cromwell)|Lord Protector]], sent a contingent of the New Model Army to Flanders to support his French allies under the terms of their treaty of friendship (the [[Treaty of Paris (1657)|Treaty of Paris, 1657]]) he supplied regiments with equal numbers of musketeers and pikemen.{{sfn|Firth|1898|pp=76\u201377}} On the battlefield, the musketeers lacked protection against enemy cavalry, and the two types of foot soldier supported each other.\n\nThe post [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] [[English_Army#Restoration|English Army]] used pikemen and by 1697 (the last year of the [[Nine Years' War]]) English infantry battalions fighting in the Low Countries still had two musketeers to every pikemen and fought in the now traditional style of pikemen five ranks deep in the centre, with six ranks of musketeers on each side.{{sfn|Chandler|Beckett|2003|p=65}}\n\nAccording to [[John Kersey the younger|John Kersey]] in 1706, the pike was typically {{convert|14|to|16|ft|m}} in length.{{sfn|Phillips|1706|date=November 2017}}\n\n==End of the pike era==\n[[File:Batalla de rocroi por Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Rocroi]] (1643) marked the end of the supremacy of the Spanish [[Tercio]]s, painting by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]] [[:es:Rocroi, el \u00faltimo tercio|picture]].]]\nThe late 17th century saw the decline of the pike in most European armies. This started with the development of the [[plug bayonet]], followed by the socket [[bayonet]].  This adds a long blade (up to 2&nbsp;ft [60.96&nbsp;cm]) to the end of the musket, allowing the musket to act as a pike-like weapon when held out with both hands. Although they didn't have the full reach of pikes, bayonets were effective against cavalry charges, which used to be the main weakness of musketeer formations; pikemen were no longer needed to protect musketeers from cavalry. Furthermore, improvements in artillery caused most European armies to abandon large formations in favor of multiple staggered lines, both to minimize casualties and to present a larger frontage for volley fire. Thick hedges of bayonets proved to be an effective [[anti-cavalry]] solution, and improved musket [[firepower]] was now so deadly that combat was often decided by shooting alone.\n\n[[File:Pikeman 1668.png|thumb|upright|An English Pikeman (1668), with steel cap, [[corselet]], and [[tassets]].]]\nA common end date for the use of the pike in infantry formations is 1700, such as the Prussian and Austrian armies. Other armies, such as the Swedish and the Russian, continued to use it for several decades afterward (the Swedes of King [[Charles XII]] in particular using it to great effect until 1721). During the [[American Revolution]] (1775-1783), pikes called \"trench spears\" made by local blacksmiths saw limited use until enough bayonets could be procured for general use by both [[Continental Army]] and attached [[militia]] units.\n\nThroughout the [[Napoleon I|Napoleonic]] era, the [[spontoon]], a kind of shortened pike with side-wings, was retained as a symbol by some NCOs; in practice it was probably more useful for gesturing and signaling than as a weapon.\n\nAs late as Poland's [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] in 1794, the pike reappeared as a child of necessity which became, for a short period, a surprisingly effective weapon on the battlefield. In this case, General [[Thaddeus Kosciuszko]], facing a shortage of [[firearm]]s and [[bayonet]]s to arm landless [[serf]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] recruited straight from the wheat fields, had their [[sickle]]s and [[scythe]]s heated and straightened out into something resembling crude \"[[war scythe]]s\". These weaponized agricultural accouterments were then used in battle as both slicing weapons, as well as makeshift pikes. The [[peasant]] \"pikemen\" armed with these crude instruments played a pivotal role in securing a near impossible victory against a far larger and better equipped Russian army at the [[Battle of Rac\u0142awice]] on April 4 of that year.\n\nCivilian pikeman played a similar role, though outnumbered and outgunned, in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rising]] in Ireland four years later. Here, especially in the [[Wexford Rebellion]] and in [[Dublin]], the pike was useful mainly as a weapon by men and women fighting on foot against [[cavalry]] armed with guns.\n\nImprovised pikes, made from [[bayonet]]s on poles, were used by escaped convicts during the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion|Castle Hill rebellion]] of 1804.\n\nAs late as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], at the dawn of the 19th century, even the Russian [[militia]] (mostly landless peasants, like the Polish partisans before them) could be found carrying shortened pikes into battle. As the 19th century progressed, the obsolete pike would still find a use in such countries as [[Ireland]], [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[Eureka Stockade|Australia]], generally in the hands of desperate peasant [[rebellion|rebel]]s who did not have access to firearms. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] planned to arm a rebel [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] army in America largely with pikes.\n\nOne attempt to resurrect the pike as a primary infantry weapon occurred during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) when the [[Confederate States of America]] planned to recruit twenty regiments of pikemen in 1862. In April 1862 it was authorised that every Confederate infantry regiment would include two companies of pikemen, a plan supported by [[Robert E. Lee]]. Many pikes were produced but were never used in battle and the plan to include pikemen in the army was abandoned.\n\nShorter versions of pikes called ''boarding pikes'' were also used on warships\u2014typically to repel [[boarding (attack)|boarding]] parties\u2014as late as the third quarter of the 19th century (1850\u20131875). [[File:US Navy 110823-N-AU127-179 Chief selectees perform boarding pike drills on the USS Constitution.jpg|thumb|American petty officers reenact boarding pike drills]]\n\nThe great [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] warrior king [[Kamehameha I, King of Hawaii|Kamehameha I]] had an elite force of men armed with very long spears who seem to have fought in a manner identical to European pikemen, despite the usual conception of his people's general disposition for individualistic dueling as their method of close combat. It is not known whether Kamehameha himself introduced this tactic or if it was taken from the use of traditional Hawaiian weapons.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe pike was issued as a [[British Home Guard]] weapon in 1942 after the [[War Office]] acted on a letter from Winston Churchill saying ''\"every man must have a weapon of some kind, be it only a mace or pike\"''. However, these hand-held weapons never left the stores after the pikes had \"generated an almost universal feeling of anger and disgust from the ranks of the Home Guard, demoralised the men and led to questions being asked in both Houses of Parliament\".{{sfn|''home-guard''|1998}} The pikes, made from obsolete [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] [[rifle]] [[bayonet]] blades welded to a steel tube, took the name of ''\"Croft's Pikes\"'' after [[Henry Page Croft]], the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] who attempted to defend the fiasco by stating that they were a \"silent and effective weapon\".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nIn Spain, beginning in 1715 and ending in 1977, there were night guards in cities called ''serenos'' who carried a short pike (1.5 meters (4.9 feet)) called ''chuzo''.\n\nPikes live on today only in ceremonial roles, being used to carry the [[colours and guidons|colours]] of an [[infantry]] regiment and with the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], or by some of the infantry units on duty during their rotation as guard<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIS_PLn_pg Cambio della guardia al Quirinale - Infantry Passing out Parade] 8:41</ref> for the [[President of the Italian Republic]] at the [[Quirinale]], in [[Rome]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pike square]]\n*[[Push of pike]]\n*[[Lance]]\n* [[Kontos (weapon)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web |title=On the Push of Pike |website=Art Military |date=21 October 2011 |url=https://artmilitary.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/on-the-push-of-pike/ |ref={{sfnref|Art Military|2011}} |access-date=17 November 2017}}\n*{{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Stanley D.

By that period, pikemen would primarily defend their unit's [[musketeer]]s from enemy cavalry.]]\n\nA '''pike''' is a [[pole weapon]], a very long thrusting [[spear]] formerly used extensively by [[infantry]]. Pikes were used regularly in European warfare from the [[Late Middle Ages]]{{sfn|Verbruggen|1997|p=151}} to the early 18th century, and were wielded by foot soldiers deployed in close quarters, until their replacement by the [[bayonet]]. The pike found extensive use with [[Landsknecht]] armies and [[Swiss mercenaries]], who employed it as their main weapon and used it in [[pike square]] formations. A similar weapon, the [[sarissa]], was also used by [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[phalanx]] infantry to great effect. Generally, a spear becomes a pike when it is too long to be wielded with one hand in combat.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Pike square img 3655.jpg|thumb|Re-enactment during the 2009 Escalade in Geneva.]]\nThe pike was a long weapon, varying considerably in size, from {{convert|3|to|7.5|m|0|abbr=off}} long. It was approximately {{convert|2.5|-|6|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, with sixteenth-century military writer Sir John Smythe recommending lighter rather than heavier pikes.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Everything you ever wanted to know about Pikes but were afraid to ask... |url=http://www.renaissancewarfare.com/1_4_Pike.html |publisher= |date= |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> It had a wooden shaft with an iron or steel spearhead affixed. The shaft near the head was often reinforced with metal strips called \"cheeks\" or langets. When the troops of opposing armies both carried the pike, it often grew in a sort of [[arms race]], getting longer in both shaft and head length to give one side's pikemen an edge in combat.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The extreme length of such weapons required a strong wood such as well-seasoned ash for the pole, which was tapered towards the point to prevent the pike from sagging on the ends, although drooping or slight flection of the shaft was always a problem in pike handling. It is a common mistake to refer to a bladed polearm as a pike; such weapons are more generally [[halberd]]s, [[glaive]]s or [[voulge]]s.\n\nThe great length of the pikes allowed a great concentration of spearheads to be presented to the enemy, with their wielders at a greater distance, but also made pikes unwieldy in close combat. This meant that pikemen had to be equipped with an additional, shorter weapon such as a [[dagger]] or [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] in order to defend themselves should the fighting degenerate into a [[melee]]. In general, however, pikemen attempted to avoid such disorganized combat, in which they were at a disadvantage. To compound their difficulties in a melee, the pikeman often did not have a shield, or had only a small shield which would be of limited use in close-quarters fighting.\n\n==Tactics==\n[[File:Pike square img 3645.jpg|thumb|First rank with pikes at \"charge for horse\" static defensive posture, ready to draw swords if needed. Second rank holding their pikes at \"charge\" for delivering thrusts.]]\n[[File:Pike square img 3653.jpg|thumb|First rank with pikes at \"charge\", second rank holding pikes at \"port\". In real action first 3 - 4 ranks will hold their pikes at \"charge\" (their points projecting forward from the formation front), and those behind will hold weapons at \"port\" (to avoid injuring front rank friendlies with their points).]]\n\nThe pike, being unwieldy, was typically used in a deliberate, defensive manner, often alongside other missile and [[melee weapon]]s. However, better-trained troops were capable of using the pike in an aggressive attack with each rank of pikemen being trained to hold their pikes so that they presented enemy infantry with four or five layers of spearheads bristling from the front of the formation.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nAs long as it kept good order, such a formation could roll right over enemy infantry but it did have weaknesses. The men were all moving forward facing in a single direction and could not turn quickly or efficiently to protect the vulnerable flanks or rear of the formation. Nor could they maintain cohesion over uneven ground, as the Scots discovered to their cost at the [[Battle of Flodden]]. The huge block of men carrying such unwieldy spears could be difficult to maneuver in any way other than straightforward movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nAs a result, such mobile pike formations sought to have supporting troops protect their flanks or would maneuver to smash the enemy before they could be outflanked themselves. There was also the risk that the formation would become disordered, leading to a confused melee in which pikemen had the vulnerabilities mentioned above.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nAccording to Sir John Smythe, there were two ways for two opposing pike formations to confront one another: cautious or aggressive. The cautious approach involved fencing at the length of the pike, while the aggressive approach involved quickly closing distance, with each of the first five ranks giving a single powerful thrust. In the aggressive approach, the first rank would then immediately resort to swords and daggers if the thrusts from the first five ranks failed to break the opposing pike formation. Smythe considered the cautious approach laughable.{{sfn|''Art Military''|2011}}\n\nAlthough primarily a military weapon, the pike could be surprisingly effective in single combat and a number of 16th-century sources explain how it was to be used in a dueling situation; fencers of the time often practiced with and competed against each other with long staves in place of pikes. George Silver considered the {{convert|18|ft|m}} pike one of the more advantageous weapons for single combat in the open, giving it odds over all weapons shorter than {{convert|8|ft|m}} or the sword and dagger/shield combination.{{sfn|Silver|1599}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient Europe===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Makedonische phalanx.png|thumb|[[Macedonian phalanx]]]]\n{{main|Sarissa}}\nAlthough very long spears had been used since the dawn of organized warfare (notably illustrated in art showing Sumerian and Minoan warriors and hunters), the earliest recorded use of a pike-like weapon in the tactical method described above involved the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] sarissa, used by the troops of [[Alexander the Great]]'s father, [[Philip II of Macedon]], and successive dynasties, which dominated warfare for several centuries in many countries. <!-- As \"pike\" is a European name for this type of weapon, this page focuses on the use of the pike in Europe. Pikes were also probably used for hunting and fishing. For more information on its classical usage in the Hellenistic world, see the entry for [[sarissa]].-->\n\nAfter the fall of the last successor of Macedon, the pike largely fell out of use for the next 1000 or so years. The one exception to this appears to have been in Germany, where [[Tacitus]] recorded Germanic tribesmen in the 2nd century AD as using \"over-long spears\". He consistently refers to the spears used by the Germans as being \"massive\" and \"very long\" suggesting that he is describing in essence a pike. [[Caesar]], in his [[De Bello Gallico]], describes the [[Helvetii]] as fighting in a tight, phalanx-like formation with spears jutting out over their shields. Caesar was probably describing an early form of the [[shieldwall]] so popular in later times.\n\n===Medieval Europe revival===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the principal users of the pike were urban militia troops such as the [[Flemings]] or the peasant array of the lowland [[Scottish people|Scots]]. For example, the Scots used a spear formation known as the ''[[schiltron]]'' in several battles during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] including the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, and the Flemings used their ''geldon'' long spear to absorb the attack of French knights at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302, before other troops in the Flemish formation counterattacked the stalled knights with [[goedendag]]s. Both battles were seen by contemporaries as stunning victories of commoners over superbly equipped, mounted, military professionals, where victory was owed to the use of the pike and the brave resistance of the commoners who wielded them.\n\nThese formations were essentially immune to the attacks of mounted men-at-arms as long as the knights obligingly threw themselves on the spear wall and the foot soldiers remained steady under the morale challenge of facing a cavalry charge, but the closely packed nature of pike formations rendered them vulnerable to enemy archers and crossbowmen who could shoot them down with impunity, especially when the pikemen did not have adequate armor. Many defeats, such as at [[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke]] and [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]], were suffered by the militia pike armies when faced by cunning foes who employed their archers and crossbowmen to thin the ranks of the pike blocks before charging in with their (often dismounted) men-at-arms.\n\n[[File:Schlacht bei Dorneck.jpg|thumb|Contemporary woodcut of the [[Battle of Dornach]].]] \nMedieval pike formations tended to have better success when they operated in an aggressive fashion. The Scots at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] (1297), for example, utilized the momentum of their charge to overrun an English army while the Englishmen were crossing a narrow bridge. At the [[Battle of Laupen]] (1339), [[Bern]]ese pikemen overwhelmed the infantry forces of the opposing Habsburg/Burgundian army with a massive charge before wheeling over to strike and rout the Austro-Burgundian horsemen as well. At the same time however such aggressive action required considerable tactical cohesiveness or suitable terrain to protect the vulnerable flanks of the pike formations especially from the attack of mounted [[man-at-arms]], when these features not available Medieval militia pikes often suffered costly failures such as at Battles of [[Battle of Mons-en-Pevele|Mons-en-Pevele]] (1304), [[Battle of Cassel (1328)|Cassel]] (1328), [[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke]] (1382) and [[Battle of Oth\u00e9e|Othee]] (1408). The constant success of the [[Swiss mercenaries]] in the later period was attributed to their extreme discipline and tactical unity due to semi-professional nature, allowing a pike block to somewhat alleviate the threat presented by flanking attacks.\n\nIt was not uncommon for aggressive pike formations to be composed of dismounted [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], as at the [[Battle of Sempach]] (1386), where the dismounted Austrian vanguard, using their lances as pikes, had some initial success against their predominantly [[halberd]]-equipped Swiss adversaries. Dismounted Italian men-at-arms also used the same method to defeat the Swiss at the [[Battle of Arbedo]] (1422). Equally, well-armored Scottish nobles (accompanied even by King [[James IV]]) were recorded as forming the leading ranks of Scottish pike blocks at the [[Battle of Flodden]], incidentally rendering the whole formation resistant to English archery.\n\n===Renaissance Europe heyday===\n[[File:Bad-war.jpg|thumb|[[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss]] and [[Landsknecht]] pikemen fight at \"[[push of pike]]\" during the [[Italian Wars]].]]\n[[File:Slag om Grolle 2008-1 - Een eenheid piekeniers doet exercities bij de kampementen.jpg|thumb|Pikemen exercising during the [[Battle of Grolle]].]]\n\nThe [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss]] solved the pike's earlier problems and brought a renaissance to pike warfare in the 15th century, establishing strong training regimens to ensure they were masters of handling the ''Spiess'' (the German term for \"skewer\") on maneuvers and in combat; they also introduced marching to drums for this purpose. This meant that the pike blocks could rise to the attack, making them less passive and more aggressive formations, but sufficiently well trained that they could go on the defensive when attacked by cavalry. German soldiers known as [[Landsknecht]]s later adopted Swiss methods of pike handling.\n\nThe [[Scottish people|Scots]] predominantly used shorter spears in their [[schiltron]] formation; their attempt to adopt the longer Continental pike was dropped for general use after its ineffective use led to humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Flodden]].\n\nSuch Swiss and Landsknecht phalanxes also contained men armed with two-handed swords, or ''[[Zweih\u00e4nder]]'', and [[halberd]]iers for close combat against both infantry and attacking cavalry.\n\nThe Swiss were confronted with the German ''Landsknecht'' who used similar tactics as the Swiss, but more pikes in the more difficult ''deutschen Stoss'' (holding a pike that had its weight in the lower 1/3 at the end with two hands), which was utilized in a more flexible attacking column.\n\nThe high military reputation of the Swiss and the ''Landsknechts'' again led to the employment of mercenary units across Europe in order to train other armies in their tactics. These two, and others who had adopted their tactics, faced off in several wars, leading to a series of developments as a result.{{sfn|Schaufelberger|1987|date=November 2017}}\n\nThese formations had great successes on the battlefield, starting with the astonishing victories of the [[Swiss cantons]] against [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in the [[Burgundian Wars]], in which the Swiss participated in 1476 and 1477. In the battles of [[Battle of Grandson|Grandson]], [[Battle of Morat|Morat]] and [[Battle of Nancy|Nancy]], the Swiss not only successfully resisted the attacks of enemy knights, as the relatively passive Scottish and Flemish infantry squares had done in the earlier Middle Ages, but also marched to the attack with great speed and in good formation, their attack columns steamrolling the Burgundian forces, sometimes with great massacre.\n\nThe deep pike attack column remained the primary form of effective infantry combat for the next forty years, and the [[Swabian War]] saw the first conflict in which both sides had large formations of well-trained pikemen. After that war, its combatants\u2014the Swiss (thereafter generally serving as [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenaries]]) and their Landsknecht imitators\u2014would often face each other again in the [[Italian Wars]], which would become in many ways the military proving ground of the Renaissance.\n\n===Ancient China===\nPikes and long halberds were in use in ancient China from the [[Warring States period]] since the 5th century BC. Infantrymen used a variety of long polearm weapons, but the most popular was the [[dagger-axe]], pike-like long spear, and the [[ji (polearm)|''ji'']]. The dagger-axe and ''ji'' came in various lengths, from 9 to 18 feet; the weapon consisted of a thrusting spear with a slashing blade appended to it. Dagger-axes and ''ji'' were an extremely popular weapon in various kingdoms, especially for the Qin state and [[Qin Dynasty]], and possibly the succeeding Han Dynasty, who produced 18-foot-long halberd and pike-like weapons, as well as 22 foot long pikes during the [[Han-Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]].By the Song dynasty, pikes around 3 meters long were standard issue for infantry all the way until the Republic of China''An Army Reborn'' (Terracotta Army) Documentary Video (August 12, 2017) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctoDUdpRwzM]</ref>\n\n===Classical Japan===\nDuring the continuous European development of the pike, Japan experienced a parallel evolution of pole weapons.\n\nIn [[History of Japan|Classical Japan]], the Japanese style of warfare was generally fast-moving and aggressive, with far shallower formations than their European equivalents. The [[naginata]] and [[yari]] were more commonly used than swords for Japanese [[ashigaru]] foot soldiers and dismounted [[samurai]] due to their greater reach. Naginata, first used around 750 AD, had curved sword-like blades on wooden shafts with often spiked metal counterweights. They were typically used with a slashing action and forced the introduction of [[Suneate|shin guards]] as cavalry battles became more important. Yari were spears of varying lengths; their straight blades usually had sharpened edges or protrusions from the central blade, and were fitted to a hollowed shaft with an extremely long tang.\n\n===Medieval Japan===\nDuring the later half of the 16th century in [[History of Japan|Medieval Japan]], pikes used were generally {{convert|4.5|to|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, but sometimes up to 10 meters in length. By this point pikemen were becoming the main forces in armies. They formed lines, combined with [[arquebusier]]s and [[spearmen]]. Formations were generally only two or three rows deep.\n\nTrans-Atlantic armies appear to have possessed spears of pike dimensions, but in the absence for most of their existence of any cavalry threat did not develop the same traditions of massed close-order pike formations.\n\nThe rise of [[firearms]] and [[artillery]] in the 16th century made the large formations consisting entirely of pikemen vulnerable to being shot down despite their close-combat power. The decline of the combat column of pikemen was starkly displayed at the terrible [[Battle of Bicocca]] in 1522, for instance, where arquebusiers contributed to the heavy defeat of a force of Swiss pikemen.\n\n==Pike and shot==\n[[File:BourtangeExerzieren2010.ogg|thumb|right|250px|A re-enactment of the [[Thirty Years' War]] with Pikiner training at the [[Bourtange]] [[star fort]].]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Italian Wars, from the end of the 15th century to the late 16th century, most European armies adopted the use of the pike, often in conjunction with primitive firearms such as the [[arquebus]] and [[caliver]], to form large pike and shot formations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nThe quintessential example of this development was the Spanish [[Tercio]], which consisted of a large square of pikemen with small, mobile squadrons of arquebusiers moving along its perimeter, as well as traditional men-at-arms. These three elements formed a mutually supportive combination of tactical roles: the arquebusiers harried the enemy line, the pikemen protected the arquebusiers from enemy cavalry charges, and the men-at-arms, typically armed with swords and javelins, fought off enemy pikemen when two opposing squares made contact. The Tercio deployed smaller numbers of pikemen than the huge Swiss and Landsknecht columns, and their formation ultimately proved to be much more flexible on the battlefield.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nMixed formations of men quickly became the norm for European infantrymen, with many, but not all, seeking to imitate the Tercio; in England, a combination of [[bill (weapon)|bill]]men, [[longbow]]men, and men-at-arms remained the norm, though this changed when the supply of [[yew]] on the island dwindled.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nThe percentage of men who were armed with firearms in Tercio-like formations steadily increased as firearms advanced in technology. This advance is believed to be the demise of cavalry when in fact it revived it. In the late sixteenth into the 17th century, smaller pike formations were used, invariably defending attached musketeers, often as a central block with two sub-units of shooters, called \"sleeves of shot\", on either side of the pikes. Although the cheaper and versatile infantry increasingly adopted firearms, cavalry's proportion in the army remained high.{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=all of the paragraph}}\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] (1642\u20131651) the [[New Model Army]] (1646\u20131660) initially had two musketeers for each pikeman.{{sfn|Firth|1972|p=70}} By about 1650 the New Model Army had all but stopped using pikemen. One of the advantages that the New Model Army gained by this was mobility\u2014musketeers who wore no armour marched on average about {{convert|15|mi|km}} a day which was about {{convert|3\u20135|mi|km}} more than pikemen could manage.{{sfn|Carpenter|2005|p=53}}\n\nTwo musketeers for each pikeman was not the agreed mix used throughout Europe, and when in 1658 [[Oliver Cromwell]], by then the [[Lord Protector (Cromwell)|Lord Protector]], sent a contingent of the New Model Army to Flanders to support his French allies under the terms of their treaty of friendship (the [[Treaty of Paris (1657)|Treaty of Paris, 1657]]) he supplied regiments with equal numbers of musketeers and pikemen.{{sfn|Firth|1898|pp=76\u201377}} On the battlefield, the musketeers lacked protection against enemy cavalry, and the two types of foot soldier supported each other.\n\nThe post [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] [[English_Army#Restoration|English Army]] used pikemen and by 1697 (the last year of the [[Nine Years' War]]) English infantry battalions fighting in the Low Countries still had two musketeers to every pikemen and fought in the now traditional style of pikemen five ranks deep in the centre, with six ranks of musketeers on each side.{{sfn|Chandler|Beckett|2003|p=65}}\n\nAccording to [[John Kersey the younger|John Kersey]] in 1706, the pike was typically {{convert|14|to|16|ft|m}} in length.{{sfn|Phillips|1706|date=November 2017}}\n\n==End of the pike era==\n[[File:Batalla de rocroi por Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Rocroi]] (1643) marked the end of the supremacy of the Spanish [[Tercio]]s, painting by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]] [[:es:Rocroi, el \u00faltimo tercio|picture]].]]\nThe late 17th century saw the decline of the pike in most European armies. This started with the development of the [[plug bayonet]], followed by the socket [[bayonet]].  This adds a long blade (up to 2&nbsp;ft [60.96&nbsp;cm]) to the end of the musket, allowing the musket to act as a pike-like weapon when held out with both hands. Although they didn't have the full reach of pikes, bayonets were effective against cavalry charges, which used to be the main weakness of musketeer formations; pikemen were no longer needed to protect musketeers from cavalry. Furthermore, improvements in artillery caused most European armies to abandon large formations in favor of multiple staggered lines, both to minimize casualties and to present a larger frontage for volley fire. Thick hedges of bayonets proved to be an effective [[anti-cavalry]] solution, and improved musket [[firepower]] was now so deadly that combat was often decided by shooting alone.\n\n[[File:Pikeman 1668.png|thumb|upright|An English Pikeman (1668), with steel cap, [[corselet]], and [[tassets]].]]\nA common end date for the use of the pike in infantry formations is 1700, such as the Prussian and Austrian armies. Other armies, such as the Swedish and the Russian, continued to use it for several decades afterward (the Swedes of King [[Charles XII]] in particular using it to great effect until 1721). During the [[American Revolution]] (1775-1783), pikes called \"trench spears\" made by local blacksmiths saw limited use until enough bayonets could be procured for general use by both [[Continental Army]] and attached [[militia]] units.\n\nThroughout the [[Napoleon I|Napoleonic]] era, the [[spontoon]], a kind of shortened pike with side-wings, was retained as a symbol by some NCOs; in practice it was probably more useful for gesturing and signaling than as a weapon.\n\nAs late as Poland's [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] in 1794, the pike reappeared as a child of necessity which became, for a short period, a surprisingly effective weapon on the battlefield. In this case, General [[Thaddeus Kosciuszko]], facing a shortage of [[firearm]]s and [[bayonet]]s to arm landless [[serf]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] recruited straight from the wheat fields, had their [[sickle]]s and [[scythe]]s heated and straightened out into something resembling crude \"[[war scythe]]s\". These weaponized agricultural accouterments were then used in battle as both slicing weapons, as well as makeshift pikes. The [[peasant]] \"pikemen\" armed with these crude instruments played a pivotal role in securing a near impossible victory against a far larger and better equipped Russian army at the [[Battle of Rac\u0142awice]] on April 4 of that year.\n\nCivilian pikeman played a similar role, though outnumbered and outgunned, in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rising]] in Ireland four years later. Here, especially in the [[Wexford Rebellion]] and in [[Dublin]], the pike was useful mainly as a weapon by men and women fighting on foot against [[cavalry]] armed with guns.\n\nImprovised pikes, made from [[bayonet]]s on poles, were used by escaped convicts during the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion|Castle Hill rebellion]] of 1804.\n\nAs late as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], at the dawn of the 19th century, even the Russian [[militia]] (mostly landless peasants, like the Polish partisans before them) could be found carrying shortened pikes into battle. As the 19th century progressed, the obsolete pike would still find a use in such countries as [[Ireland]], [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[Eureka Stockade|Australia]], generally in the hands of desperate peasant [[rebellion|rebel]]s who did not have access to firearms. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] planned to arm a rebel [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] army in America largely with pikes.\n\nOne attempt to resurrect the pike as a primary infantry weapon occurred during the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865) when the [[Confederate States of America]] planned to recruit twenty regiments of pikemen in 1862. In April 1862 it was authorised that every Confederate infantry regiment would include two companies of pikemen, a plan supported by [[Robert E. Lee]]. Many pikes were produced but were never used in battle and the plan to include pikemen in the army was abandoned.\n\nShorter versions of pikes called ''boarding pikes'' were also used on warships\u2014typically to repel [[boarding (attack)|boarding]] parties\u2014as late as the third quarter of the 19th century (1850-1875).

It is not known whether Kamehameha himself introduced this tactic or if it was taken from the use of traditional Hawaiian weapons.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe pike was issued as a [[British Home Guard]] weapon in 1942 after the [[War Office]] acted on a letter from Winston Churchill saying ''\"every man must have a weapon of some kind, be it only a mace or pike\"''. However, these hand-held weapons never left the stores after the pikes had \"generated an almost universal feeling of anger and disgust from the ranks of the Home Guard, demoralised the men and led to questions being asked in both Houses of Parliament\".{{sfn|''home-guard''|1998}} The pikes, made from obsolete [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] [[rifle]] [[bayonet]] blades welded to a steel tube, took the name of ''\"Croft's Pikes\"'' after [[Henry Page Croft]], the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] who attempted to defend the fiasco by stating that they were a \"silent and effective weapon\".{{sfn|MacKenzie|1995|pp=97-100}}\n\nIn Spain, beginning in 1715 and ending in 1977, there were night guards in cities called ''serenos'' who carried a short pike (1.5 meters (4.9 feet)) called ''chuzo''.\n\nPikes live on today only in ceremonial roles, being used to carry the [[colours and guidons|colours]] of an [[infantry]] regiment and with the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], or by some of the infantry units on duty during their rotation as guard<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIS_PLn_pg Cambio della guardia al Quirinale - Infantry Passing out Parade] 8:41</ref> for the [[President of the Italian Republic]] at the [[Quirinale]], in [[Rome]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pike square]]\n*[[Push of pike]]\n*[[Lance]]\n* [[Kontos (weapon)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web |title=On the Push of Pike |website=Art Military |date=21 October 2011 |url=https://artmilitary.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/on-the-push-of-pike/ |ref={{sfnref|Art Military|2011}} |access-date=17 November 2017}}\n*{{cite book |last=Carpenter |first=Stanley D.

{"title_page": "Degree distribution", "text_new": "{{Network Science}}\n[[File:Enwiki-degree-distribution.png|thumb|right|320px|In/out degree distribution for Wikipedia's hyperlink graph (logarithmic scales)]]\nIn the study of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] and [[complex network|networks]], the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of a node in a network is the number of connections it has to other nodes and the '''degree distribution''' is the [[probability distribution]] of these degrees over the whole network.\n\n==Definition==\nThe [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of a node in a network (sometimes referred to incorrectly as the [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]]) is the number of connections or [[Edge (graph theory)#Graph|edges]] the node has to other nodes. If a network is [[directed graph|directed]], meaning that edges point in one direction from one node to another node, then nodes have two different degrees, the in-degree, which is the number of incoming edges, and the out-degree, which is the number of outgoing edges.\n\nThe degree distribution ''P''(''k'') of a network is then defined to be the fraction of nodes in the network with degree ''k''.  Thus if there are ''n'' nodes in total in a network and ''n''<sub>''k''</sub> of them have degree ''k'', we have ''P''(''k'') = ''n''<sub>''k''</sub>/''n''.\n\nThe same information is also sometimes presented in the form of a ''cumulative degree distribution'', the fraction of nodes with degree smaller than ''k'', or even the ''complementary cumulative degree distribution'', the fraction of nodes with degree greater than or equal to ''k'' (1 - ''C'') if one considers ''C'' as the ''cumulative degree distribution'';  i.e. the complement of ''C''.\n\n== Observed degree distributions ==\nThe degree distribution is very important in studying both real networks, such as the [[Internet]] and [[social networks]], and theoretical networks.  The simplest network model, for example, the (Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model) [[random graph]], in which each of ''n'' nodes is independently connected (or not) with probability ''p'' (or 1 \u2212 ''p''), has a [[binomial distribution]] of degrees ''k'':\n\n:<math>\nP(k) = {n-1\\choose k} p^k (1 - p)^{n-1-k},\n</math>\n\n(or [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] in the limit of large ''n'', if the average degree <math>\\langle k\\rangle=p(n-1)</math> is held fixed). Most networks in the real world, however, have degree distributions very different from this. Most are highly [[Skewness|right-skewed]], meaning that a large majority of nodes have low degree but a small number, known as \"hubs\", have high degree. Some networks, notably the Internet, the [[world wide web]], and some social networks were argued to have degree distributions that approximately follow a [[power law]]: <math>\nP(k)\\sim k^{-\\gamma}\n</math>, where ''\u03b3'' is a constant.

{"title_page": "List of paradoxes", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\nThis is a '''list of paradoxes''', grouped thematically. The grouping is approximate, as paradoxes may fit into more than one category. This list collects only scenarios that have been called a [[paradox]] by at least one source and have their own article. Although considered paradoxes, some of these are simply based on fallacious reasoning ([[falsidical]]), or an unintuitive solution ([[Veridical paradox|veridical]]). Informally, the term ''paradox'' is often used to describe a counter-intuitive result.\n\nHowever, some of these paradoxes qualify to fit into the mainstream perception of a paradox, which is a self-contradictory result gained even while properly applying accepted ways of [[reason]]ing. These paradoxes, often called ''[[antinomy]],'' point out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of [[truth]] and [[Definite description|description]].\n\n== Logic ==\n\n* {{bl|Barbershop paradox}}: The supposition that, 'if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction, the other assumption is also disproved' leads to paradoxical consequences. Not to be confused with the [[Barber paradox]].\n* {{bl|What the Tortoise Said to Achilles}}: If a presumption needs to be made that a specific result can be deduced from premises, then the result can never be deduced. Also known as ''Carroll's paradox'' and is not to be confused with the \"Achilles and the tortoise\" paradox by [[Zeno of Elea]].\n* {{bl|Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22}}: A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane.\n* {{bl|Drinker paradox}}: In any pub there is a customer of whom it is true to say: if that customer is drinking, everybody in the pub is drinking.\n* {{bl|Paradox of entailment}}: Inconsistent premises always make an argument valid.\n* {{bl|Lottery paradox}}: If there is one winning ticket in a large lottery, it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket, but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win.\n* {{bl|Raven paradox}}: (or Hempel's Ravens): Observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black.\n* {{bl|Ross' paradox}}: Disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred.\n* {{bl|Unexpected hanging paradox}}: The day of the hanging will be a surprise, so it cannot happen at all, so it will be a surprise. The ''surprise examination'' and [[The Bottle Imp|Bottle Imp paradox]] use similar logic.\n\n=== {{vanchor|Self-reference|Self\u2013reference}} ===\nThese paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either [[self-reference]] or [[circular reference]], in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point.\n\n* {{bl|Barber paradox}}: A male barber shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? (Russell's popularization of [[Russell's paradox|his set theoretic paradox]].)\n* {{bl|Bhartrhari's paradox}}: The thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable.\n* {{bl|Berry paradox}}: The phrase \"the first number not nameable in under ten words\" appears to name it in nine words.\n* {{bl|Crocodile dilemma}}: If a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do, how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned?\n* {{bl|Paradox of the Court}}: A law student agrees to pay his teacher after (and only after) winning his first case. The teacher then sues the student (who has not yet won a case) for payment.\n* {{bl|Curry's paradox}}: \"If this sentence is true, then Santa Claus exists.\"\n* {{bl|Epimenides paradox}}: A Cretan says: \"All Cretans are liars\". This paradox works in mainly the same way as the [[liar paradox]].\n* {{bl|Grelling\u2013Nelson paradox}}: Is the word \"heterological\", meaning \"not applicable to itself\", a heterological word? (A close relative of [[Russell's paradox]].)\n* {{bl|Hilbert-Bernays paradox}}: If there was a name for a natural number that is identical to a name of the [[successor function|successor]] of that number, there would be a natural number equal to its successor.\n* {{bl|Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox}}: By formulating an equivalent to [[Richard's paradox]], [[untyped lambda calculus]] is shown to be inconsistent.\n* {{bl|Knower paradox}}: \"This sentence is not known.\"\n* {{bl|Liar paradox}}: \"This sentence is false.\" This is the canonical self-referential paradox. Also \"Is the answer to this question 'no'?\", and \"I'm lying.\"\n**{{bl|Card paradox}}: \"The next statement is true. The previous statement is false.\" A variant of the liar paradox in which neither of the sentences employs (direct) self-reference, instead this is a case of circular reference.\n** {{bl|No-no paradox}}: Two sentences that each say the other is not true.\n** {{bl|Pinocchio paradox}}: What would happen if [[Pinocchio]] said \"My nose grows now\"?<ref>{{cite journal | last = Eldridge-Smith | first = Peter | last2 = Eldridge-Smith | first2 = Veronique | date = 13 January 2010 | title = The Pinocchio paradox | journal = Analysis | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 212\u2013215 | issn = 1467-8284 | doi = 10.1093/analys/anp173 }}<br />{{As of|2010}}, an image of Pinocchio with a speech bubble \"My nose will grow now!\" has become a minor Internet phenomenon ([https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pinocchio+paradox%22 Google search], [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pinocchio+paradox%22 Google image search]). It seems likely that this paradox has been independently conceived multiple times.</ref>\n** {{bl|Quine's paradox}}: \"'Yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation' yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation.\" Shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals.\n** {{bl|Yablo's paradox}}: An ordered infinite sequence of sentences, each of which says that all following sentences are false. While constructed to avoid self-reference, there is no consensus whether it relies on self-reference or not.\n* {{bl|Opposite Day}}: \"It is opposite day today.\" Therefore, it is not opposite day, but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day, which contradicts the fact that it has previously been stated that it is an opposite day.\n* {{bl|Richard's paradox}}: We appear to be able to use simple English to define a decimal expansion in a way that is self-contradictory.\n* {{bl|Russell's paradox}}: Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?\n* {{bl|Socratic paradox}}: \"All I know is that I know nothing.\"\n\n=== Vagueness ===\n\n* {{bl|Ship of Theseus}}: It seems like you can replace any component of a ship, and it is still the same ship. So you can replace them all, one at a time, and it is still the same ship. However, you can then take all the original pieces, and assemble them into a ship. That, too, is the same ship you began with.\n: See also {{bl|List of Ship of Theseus examples}}\n* {{bl|Sorites paradox}} (also known as the [[paradox of the heap]]): If you remove a single grain of sand from a heap, you still have a heap. Keep removing single grains, and the heap will disappear. Can a single grain of sand make the difference between heap and non-heap?\n\n== Mathematics ==\n{{See also|Category:Mathematics paradoxes|Paradoxes of set theory}}\n\n* {{bl|All horses are the same color}}: A fallacious argument by induction that appears to prove that all horses are the same color.\n* {{bl|Ant on a rubber rope}}: An ant crawling on a rubber rope can reach the end even when the rope stretches much faster than the ant can crawl.\n* {{bl|Cramer's paradox}}: The number of points of intersection of two higher-order curves can be greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve.\n* {{bl|Elevator paradox}}: Elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction, as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement.\n* {{bl|Interesting number paradox}}: The first number that can be considered \"dull\" rather than \"interesting\" becomes interesting because of that fact.\n* {{bl|Potato paradox}}: If you let potatoes consisting of 99% water dry so that they are 98% water, they lose 50% of their weight.\n* {{bl|Russell's paradox}}: Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?\n\n=== Statistics ===\n{{See also|Category:Statistical paradoxes}}\n\n* {{bl|Abelson's paradox}}: Effect size may not be indicative of practical meaning.\n* {{bl|Accuracy paradox}}: Predictive models with a given level of accuracy may have greater predictive power than models with higher accuracy.\n* {{bl|Berkson's paradox}}: A complicating factor arising in statistical tests of proportions.\n* {{bl|Freedman's paradox}}: Describes a problem in [[model selection]] where predictor variables with no explanatory power can appear artificially important.\n* {{bl|Friendship paradox}}: For almost everyone, their friends have more friends than they do.\n* {{bl|Inspection paradox}}: Why one will wait longer for a bus than one should.\n* {{bl|Lindley's paradox}}: Tiny errors in the null hypothesis are magnified when large data sets are analyzed, leading to false but highly statistically significant results.\n* {{bl|Low birth weight paradox}}: Low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate. Babies of smokers have lower average birth weight, but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies. This is a special case of Simpson's paradox.\n* {{bl|Simpson's paradox}}, or the '''{{bl|Yule\u2013Simpson effect}}''': A trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data.\n* {{bl|Will Rogers phenomenon}}: The mathematical concept of an average, whether defined as the [[mean]] or [[median]], leads to apparently paradoxical results\u2014for example, it is possible that moving an entry from an [[encyclopedia]] to a [[dictionary]] would increase the average entry length on ''both'' books.\n\n=== Probability ===\n\n[[File:Monty open door.svg|thumb|right|The [[Monty Hall problem]]: which door do you choose?]]\n\n{{See also|Category:Probability theory paradoxes}}\n\n* {{bl|Bertrand's box paradox}}: A paradox of conditional probability closely related to the Boy or Girl paradox.\n* {{bl|Bertrand's paradox (probability)|Bertrand's paradox}}: Different common-sense definitions of randomness give quite different results.\n* {{bl|Birthday problem}}: What is the chance that two people in a room have the same birthday?\n* {{bl|Borel's paradox}}: Conditional probability density functions are not invariant under coordinate transformations.\n* {{bl|Boy or Girl paradox}}: A two-child family has at least one boy. What is the probability that it has a girl?\n* '''Dartboard Puzzle:''' If a dart is guaranteed to hit a dartboard and the probability of hitting a specific point is positive, adding the infinitely many positive chances yields infinity, but the chance of hitting the dartboard is one. If the probability of hitting each point is zero, the probability of hitting anywhere on the dartboard is zero.<ref>{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=Infinity Paradoxes - Numberphile|date=2013-07-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDl7g_2x74Q|accessdate=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n* {{bl|False positive paradox}}: A test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease, but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny.\n* {{bl|Grice's paradox}}: Shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination.\n* {{bl|Monty Hall problem}}: An unintuitive consequence of conditional probability.\n* {{bl|Necktie paradox}}: A wager between two people seems to favour them both. Very similar in essence to the [[Two-envelope paradox]].\n* {{bl|Nontransitive dice}}: You can have three dice, called A, B, and C, such that A is likely to win in a roll against B, B is likely to win in a roll against C, and C is likely to win in a roll against A.\n* {{bl|Proebsting's paradox}}: The [[Kelly criterion]] is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run. Proebsting's paradox apparently shows that the Kelly criterion can lead to ruin.\n* {{bl|Sleeping Beauty problem}}: A probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached.\n* {{bl|Three cards problem}}: When pulling a random card, how do you determine the color of the underside?\n* {{bl|Three Prisoners problem}}: A variation of the [[Monty Hall problem]].\n* {{bl|Two-envelope paradox}}: You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each of which contains a positive sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains. You pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead.\n\n=== Infinity and infinitesimals ===\n\n* {{bl|Burali-Forti paradox}}: If the [[ordinal number]]s formed a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself.\n* {{bl|Cantor's paradox}}: The [[set of all sets]] would have its own [[power set]] as a subset, therefore its [[cardinality]] would be at least as great as that of its power set. But [[Cantor's theorem]] proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from. Consequently, the set of all sets would contain a subset greater than itself.\n* {{bl|Galileo's paradox}}: Though most numbers are not squares, there are no more numbers than squares. (See also [[Cantor's diagonal argument]])\n* {{bl|Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel}}: If a hotel with [[Infinite set|infinitely many]] rooms is full, it can still take in more guests.\n* {{bl|Skolem's paradox}}: [[Countable|Countably]] infinite models of [[Axiomatic set theory|set theory]] contain [[Uncountable|uncountably]] infinite sets.\n* {{bl|Zeno's paradoxes}}: \"You will never reach point B from point A as you must always get half-way there, and half of the half, and half of that half, and so on.\" (This is also a physical paradox.)\n* [[Supertask]]s may result in paradoxes such as\n:* {{bl|Benardete's paradox}}: Apparently, a man can be \"forced to stay where he is by the mere unfulfilled intentions of the gods\".\n:* {{bl|Grandi's series}}: The sum of 1-1+1-1+1-1... can be either one, zero, or one-half.\n:* {{bl|Ross\u2013Littlewood paradox}}: After alternately adding and removing balls to a vase infinitely often, how many balls remain?\n:* {{bl|Thomson's lamp}}: After flicking a lamp on and off infinitely often, is it on or off?\n\n=== Geometry and topology ===\n\n[[File:Banach-Tarski Paradox.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]: A ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two balls the same size as the original.]]\n\n* {{bl|Banach\u2013Tarski paradox}}: Cut a ball into a finite number of pieces and re-assemble the pieces to get two balls, each of equal size to the first. The [[von Neumann paradox]] is a two-dimensional analogue.\n** {{bl|Paradoxical set}}: A set that can be partitioned into two sets, each of which is equivalent to the original.\n* {{bl|Coastline paradox}}: the perimeter of a landmass is in general ill-defined.\n* {{bl|Coin rotation paradox}}: a coin rotating along the edge of an identical coin will make a full revolution after traversing only half of the stationary coin's circumference.\n* {{bl|Gabriel's Horn}}: or '''{{bl|Torricelli's trumpet}}''': A simple object with finite volume but infinite surface area. Also, the [[Mandelbrot set]] and various other [[fractal]]s are covered by a finite area, but have an infinite perimeter (in fact, there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary, which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk \"the wrong way\" around the set to reach a nearby point).\n* {{bl|Hausdorff paradox}}: There exists a countable subset C of the sphere S such that S\\C is equidecomposable with two copies of itself.\n* {{bl|Nikodym set}}: A set contained in and with the same [[Lebesgue measure]] as the [[unit square]], yet for every one of its points there is a straight line intersecting the Nikodym set only in that point.\n* {{bl|Sphere eversion}}: A sphere can, topologically, be turned inside out.\n\n== Decision theory ==\n\n* {{bl|Abilene paradox}}: People can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do, but on what they think that other people want to do, with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do, but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do.\n* {{bl|Apportionment paradox}}: Some systems of apportioning representation can have unintuitive results due to rounding\n** {{bl|Alabama paradox}}: Increasing the total number of seats might shrink one block's seats.\n** {{bl|New states paradox}}: Adding a new state or voting block might increase the number of votes of another.\n** {{bl|Population paradox}}: A fast-growing state can lose votes to a slow-growing state.\n* {{bl|Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's paradox}}: Given more than two choices, no system can have all the attributes of an ideal [[voting system]] at once.\n* {{bl|Buridan's ass}}: How can a [[rationality|rational]] choice be made between two outcomes of equal [[Value theory|value]]?\n* {{bl|Chainstore paradox}}: Even those who know better play the so-called chain store game in an irrational manner.\n* {{bl|Decision-making paradox}}: Selecting the best decision-making method is a decision problem in itself.\n* {{bl|Ellsberg paradox}}: People exhibit [[ambiguity aversion]] (as distinct from [[risk aversion]]), in contradiction with [[expected utility]] theory.\n* {{bl|Fenno's paradox}}: The belief that people generally disapprove of the United States Congress as a whole, but support the Congressman from their own Congressional district.\n* {{bl|Fredkin's paradox}}: The more similar two choices are, the more time a decision-making agent spends on deciding.\n* {{bl|Green paradox}}: Policies intending to reduce future CO<sub>2</sub> emissions may lead to increased emissions in the present.\n* {{bl|Hedgehog's dilemma}}: or '''Lover's paradox''' Despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm.\n* {{bl|Inventor's paradox}}: It is easier to solve a more general problem that covers the specifics of the sought-after solution.\n* {{bl|Kavka's toxin puzzle}}: Can one ''intend'' to drink the non-deadly toxin, if the intention is the only thing needed to get the reward?\n*'''[[Motivation crowding theory]]:''' Adding incentives for some behavior can sometimes backfire and actually result in less of that behavior.\n* {{bl|Morton's fork}}: a type of false dilemma in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion. \n* {{bl|Navigation paradox}}: Increased navigational precision may result in increased collision risk.\n* {{bl|Newcomb's paradox}}: How do you play a game against an [[omniscient]] opponent?\n* {{bl|Paradox of tolerance}}: Should one tolerate intolerance if intolerance would destroy the possibility of tolerance?\n* {{bl|Paradox of voting}}: Also known as the Downs paradox. For a rational, self-interested voter the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits, so why do people keep voting?\n* {{bl|Parrondo's paradox}}: It is possible to play two losing games alternately to eventually win.\n* {{bl|Prevention paradox}}: For one person to benefit, many people have to change their behavior \u2013 even though they receive no benefit, or even suffer, from the change.\n* {{bl|Prisoner's dilemma}}: Two people might not cooperate even if it is in both their best interests to do so.\n* {{bl|Voting paradox}}: Also known as Condorcet's paradox and paradox of voting. A group of separately rational individuals may have preferences that are irrational in the aggregate.\n* {{bl|Willpower paradox}}: Those who kept their minds open were more goal-directed and more motivated than those who declared their objective to themselves.\n\n== Physics ==\n{{details|Physical paradox}}\n\n[[File:Tea Leaf Paradox Stirring.ogv|thumb|A demonstration of the [[tea leaf paradox]]]]\n\n* {{bl|Cool tropics paradox}}: A contradiction between modelled estimates of tropical temperatures during warm, ice-free periods of the Cretaceous and Eocene, and the lower temperatures that proxies suggest were present.\n* {{bl|Irresistible force paradox}}: What would happen if an unstoppable force hit an immovable object?\n* {{bl|Paradox of place}}: If everything that exists has a place, that place must have a place, and so on ad infinitum.\n* {{bl|Paradox of the grain of millet}}: When a grain of millet falls it makes no sound, but when a thousand grains fall they do, thus many of nothing become something.\n* {{bl|The moving rows}}: Suppose two rows are moving past a stationary row in opposite directions, if a member of a moving row moves past a member of the stationary row in an indivisible instant of time, they move past two members of the row that is moving in the other direction in this instant of time.\n\n=== Astrophysics ===\n\n* {{bl|Algol paradox}}: In some binary star systems the partners seem to have different ages, even though they are thought to have formed at the same time.\n* {{bl|Faint young Sun paradox}}: The contradiction between existence of liquid water early in the Earth's history and the expectation that the output of the young Sun would have been insufficient to melt ice on Earth.\n* {{bl|GZK paradox}}: [[Extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s have been observed that seem to violate the [[Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin limit]], which is a consequence of [[special relativity]].\n* {{bl|Galactic Center#paradox of youth in Galactic Center|Paradox of youth}}: Compared to theory, there is an overabundance of young stars close to the supermassive black hole in the [[Galactic Center]].\n* '''Olbers' paradox''': see {{slink||Cosmology}}\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\n\n* {{bl|Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise|Achilles and the tortoise}}: If the tortoise is ahead of Achilles, by the time Achilles reaches the tortoise's current position, the tortoise will have moved a bit further ahead, which goes on indefinitely.\n* {{bl|Archer's paradox}}: An archer must, in order to hit his target, not aim directly at it, but slightly to the side. Not to be confused with the arrow paradox.\n* {{bl|Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Arrow_paradox|Arrow paradox}} If we divide time into discrete 0-duration slices, no motion is happening in each of them, so taking them all as a whole, motion is impossible.\n* {{bl|Hydrostatic paradox}}: A massive battleship can float in a few litres of water.\n* {{bl|Aristotle's wheel paradox}}: Rolling joined concentric wheels seem to trace the same distance with their circumferences, even though the circumferences are different.\n* {{bl|Carroll's paradox}}: The angular momentum of a stick should be zero, but is not.\n* {{bl|D'Alembert's paradox}}: Flow of an [[viscosity|inviscid]] fluid produces no net force on a solid body.\n*{{bl|Knudsen paradox}}: Based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, one would expect the mass flux in a channel to decrease with increasing Knudsen number, but there is a distinct minimum around [[Knudsen number]] 0.8.\n* {{bl|Denny's paradox}}: Surface-dwelling [[arthropod]]s (such as the [[water strider]]) should not be able to propel themselves horizontally.\n* {{bl|Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Dichotomy_paradox|Dichotomy paradox}}: To reach its target, an airborne arrow must first reach an infinite number of midpoints between its current position and the target.\n* {{bl|Elevator paradox (physics)|Elevator paradox}}: Even though hydrometers are used to measure fluid density, a hydrometer will not indicate changes of fluid density caused by changing atmospheric pressure.\n* {{bl|Feynman sprinkler}}: Which way does a sprinkler rotate when submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding fluid?\n* {{bl|Norton's dome}}: Are there non-deterministic systems in Newtonian mechanics?\n* {{bl|Painlev\u00e9 paradox}}: Rigid-body dynamics with contact and friction is inconsistent.\n* {{bl|Tea leaf paradox}}: When a cup of tea is stirred, the leaves assemble in the center, even though centrifugal force pushes them outward.\n* {{bl|Upstream contamination}}: When a fluid is poured from a higher container onto a lower one, particles can climb up the falling water.\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n\n* {{bl|Bentley's paradox}}: In a Newtonian universe, gravitation should pull all matter into a single point.\n* {{bl|Boltzmann brain}}: If the universe we observe resulted from a random thermodynamic fluctuation, it would be vastly more likely to be a simple one than the complex one we observe.

The grouping is approximate, as paradoxes may fit into more than one category. This list collects only scenarios that have been called a [[paradox]] by at least one source and have their own article. Although considered paradoxes, some of these are simply based on fallacious reasoning ([[falsidical]]), or an unintuitive solution ([[Veridical paradox|veridical]]). Informally, the term ''paradox'' is often used to describe a counter-intuitive result.\n\nHowever, some of these paradoxes qualify to fit into the mainstream perception of a paradox, which is a self-contradictory result gained even while properly applying accepted ways of [[reason]]ing. These paradoxes, often called ''[[antinomy]],'' point out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of [[truth]] and [[Definite description|description]].\n\n== Logic ==\n\n* {{bl|Barbershop paradox}}: The supposition that, 'if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction, the other assumption is also disproved' leads to paradoxical consequences. Not to be confused with the [[Barber paradox]].\n* {{bl|What the Tortoise Said to Achilles}}: If a presumption needs to be made that a specific result can be deduced from premises, then the result can never be deduced.

The name signifies that the lists were originally made on paper index cards, compiled by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] before he became director of the FBI.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/> The Index List was used to track U.S. citizens and others believed by the FBI to be dangerous to [[national security]], and was subdivided into various divisions which generally were rated based on different classes of danger the subject was thought to represent. There is no indication the FBI stopped adding names onto its Index List before September 11, 2001.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, the date which the FBI folded its Index List into the [[Terrorist Screening Database]] (TSDB) is unknown, while the FBI consolidates the TSDB from other lists and manages its information. The TSDB is currently available to all U.S. national security agencies, while select information contained on the TSDB is forwarded to other nation states and international security agencies.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n== General Intelligence Division ==\nAround the time of [[World War I]] and the [[First Red Scare]], [[William J. Flynn]] of the Bureau of Investigation had [[J. Edgar Hoover]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} set up a General Intelligence Division (GID). Hoover used his experience working as a [[librarian|library clerk]] at the National Archives to set up the system using extensive [[cross-referencing]].\n\nThe GID took files from the Bureau of Investigations (later renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and 'systematized' them via index cards; according to Walker and contrary to evidence, the cards covered 200,000 people.<ref name=walker1/> But by 1939, Hoover had more than 10 million people 'Indexed' in the FBI's domestic file system.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/>\n\nAlthough the GID was shut down in 1924 after objections from people such as [[William J. Donovan]] who called into question its constitutionality,<ref name=riebling1/> Hoover and the FBI continued to expand the Index system for use by the agency, by Hoover, and by Hoover's political associates well into the 1970s. Today, the Index files covering untold numbers of Americans are still accessible by the FBI and its 29 field offices.\n\nTitles to numerous Index catalogs include:<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/> The Reserve Index, for influential people to be \"arrested and held\" in case of a national emergency; The Custodial Index, which included 110,000 Japanese Americans that were held in internment prison camps during World War II; The Sexual Deviant Index; The Agitator Index; The Communist Index; and The Administrative Index, which compiled several other earlier indexes.\n\nEven though a complete list of Index titles is currently unavailable, Hoover and the FBI used their Index system to catalog Native American and African American liberation movements during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as Vietnam War protesters and other college students.\n\n== Custodial Detention Index ==\nThe '''Custodial Detention Index''' ('''CDI'''), or '''Custodial Detention List''' was formed in 1939\u20131941, in the frame of a program called variously the \"Custodial Detention Program\" or \"Alien Enemy Control\".\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover described it as having come from his resurrected General Intelligence Division in Washington. According to Hoover, it created large numbers of files on \"individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in subversive activities\", including espionage, and enabled the Bureau to immediately identify potential threats.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/> Congressmen [[Vito Marcantonio]] called it \"terror by index cards\". Senator [[George W. Norris]] complained as well.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/>\n\nThe Custodial Detention Index was a list of suspects and potential subversives, classified as \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\"; the ones classified as \"A\" were destined to be immediately arrested and interned at the outbreak of war. Category A were leaders of Axis-related organizations, category B were members deemed \"less dangerous\" and category C were sympathizers. The actual assignment of the categories was, however, based on the perceived individual commitment to the person's native country, rather than the actual potential to cause harm; leaders of cultural organizations could be classified as \"A\".\n\nThe program involved creation of individual dossiers from secretly obtained information, including unsubstantiated data and in some cases, even hearsay and unsolicited phone tips, and information acquired without judicial warrants by [[mail cover]]s and [[postal interception|interception of mail]], [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s and covert searches. While the program targeted primarily Japanese, Italian, and German \"[[enemy alien]]s\", it also included some native-born American citizens. The program was run without Congress-approved legal authority, with no [[judicial oversight]] and outside of the official legal boundaries of the FBI. A person against which an accusation was made was investigated and eventually placed on the index; it was not removed until the person died. Getting on the list was easy; getting off of it was virtually impossible.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~apreston/Taken_Into_Custody.html \n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031128111253/http://www.uvm.edu/~apreston/Taken_Into_Custody.html\n  |title=Taken Into Custody: the Internment of German and Italian Americans during World War II\n  |last1=Preston \n  |first1=Audra \n  |archive-date=28 November 2003 \n  |website=uvm.edu\n  |publisher=[[University of Vermont]] personal homepage\n  |accessdate=18 April 2020\n}}</ref> According to the press releases at the beginning of the war, one of the purposes of the program was to demonstrate the diligence and vigilance of the government by following, arresting and isolating a previously identified group of people with allegedly documented sympathies for [[Axis powers]] and potential for [[espionage]] or [[fifth column]] activities.

The name signifies that the lists were originally made on paper index cards, compiled by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] before he became director of the FBI.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/> The Index List was used to track U.S. citizens and others believed by the FBI to be dangerous to [[national security]], and was subdivided into various divisions which generally were rated based on different classes of danger the subject was thought to represent. There is no indication the FBI stopped adding names onto its Index List before September 11, 2001.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, the date which the FBI folded its Index List into the [[Terrorist Screening Database]] (TSDB) is unknown, while the FBI consolidates the TSDB from other lists and manages its information. The TSDB is currently available to all U.S. national security agencies, while select information contained on the TSDB is forwarded to other nation states and international security agencies.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n\n== General Intelligence Division ==\nAround the time of [[World War I]] and the [[First Red Scare]], [[William J. Flynn]] of the Bureau of Investigation had [[J. Edgar Hoover]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} set up a General Intelligence Division (GID). Hoover used his experience working as a [[librarian|library clerk]] at the National Archives to set up the system using extensive [[cross-referencing]].\n\nThe GID took files from the Bureau of Investigations (later renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and 'systematized' them via index cards; according to Walker and contrary to evidence, the cards covered 200,000 people.<ref name=walker1/> But by 1939, Hoover had more than 10 million people 'Indexed' in the FBI's domestic file system.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/>\n\nAlthough the GID was shut down in 1924 after objections from people such as [[William J. Donovan]] who called into question its constitutionality,<ref name=riebling1/> Hoover and the FBI continued to expand the Index system for use by the agency, by Hoover, and by Hoover's political associates well into the 1970s. Today, the Index files covering untold numbers of Americans are still accessible by the FBI and its 29 field offices.\n\nTitles to numerous Index catalogs include:<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/> The Reserve Index, for influential people to be \"arrested and held\" in case of a national emergency; The Custodial Index, which included 110,000 Japanese Americans that were held in internment prison camps during World War II; The Sexual Deviant Index; The Agitator Index; The Communist Index; and The Administrative Index, which compiled several other earlier indexes.\n\nEven though a complete list of Index titles is currently unavailable, Hoover and the FBI used their Index system to catalog Native American and African American liberation movements during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as Vietnam War protesters and other college students.\n\n== Custodial Detention Index ==\nThe '''Custodial Detention Index''' ('''CDI'''), or '''Custodial Detention List''' was formed in 1939\u20131941, in the frame of a program called variously the \"Custodial Detention Program\" or \"Alien Enemy Control\".\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover described it as having come from his resurrected General Intelligence Division in Washington. According to Hoover, it created large numbers of files on \"individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in subversive activities\", including espionage, and enabled the Bureau to immediately identify potential threats.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/> Congressmen [[Vito Marcantonio]] called it \"terror by index cards\". Senator [[George W. Norris]] complained as well.<ref name=\"Gentry91\"/>\n\nThe Custodial Detention Index was a list of suspects and potential subversives, classified as \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\"; the ones classified as \"A\" were destined to be immediately arrested and interned at the outbreak of war. Category A were leaders of Axis-related organizations, category B were members deemed \"less dangerous\" and category C were sympathizers. The actual assignment of the categories was, however, based on the perceived individual commitment to the person's native country, rather than the actual potential to cause harm; leaders of cultural organizations could be classified as \"A\".\n\nThe program involved creation of individual dossiers from secretly obtained information, including unsubstantiated data and in some cases, even hearsay and unsolicited phone tips, and information acquired without judicial warrants by [[mail cover]]s and [[postal interception|interception of mail]], [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s and covert searches. While the program targeted primarily Japanese, Italian, and German \"[[enemy alien]]s\", it also included some native-born American citizens. The program was run without Congress-approved legal authority, with no [[judicial oversight]] and outside of the official legal boundaries of the FBI. A person against which an accusation was made was investigated and eventually placed on the index; it was not removed until the person died. Getting on the list was easy; getting off of it was virtually impossible.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~apreston/Taken_Into_Custody.html \n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031128111253/http://www.uvm.edu/~apreston/Taken_Into_Custody.html\n  |title=Taken Into Custody: the Internment of German and Italian Americans during World War II\n  |last1=Preston \n  |first1=Audra \n  |archive-date=28 November 2003 \n  |website=uvm.edu\n  |publisher=[[University of Vermont]] personal homepage\n  |accessdate=18 April 2020\n}}</ref> According to the press releases at the beginning of the war, one of the purposes of the program was to demonstrate the diligence and vigilance of the government by following, arresting and isolating a previously identified group of people with allegedly documented sympathies for [[Axis powers]] and potential for [[espionage]] or [[fifth column]] activities. The list was later used for [[Japanese American internment]] after Roosevelt's [[Executive Order 9066]].{{fact|date=October 2018}} Although some say Hoover actually opposed those measures,<ref>{{cite web \n  |url=http://www.asian-nation.org/internment.shtml \n  |title=Construction and Destruction: Japanese American Internment\n  |last1=Le\n  |first1=C.N.\n  |date=2020 \n  |website=asian-nation.org \n  |publisher=Dr. C.N.

The party mainly followed a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] and nationalist political agenda throughout the latter half of the 20th century, but later moderated its views under the leadership of [[Devlet Bah\u00e7eli]], who took over after T\u00fcrke\u015f's death in 1997. The party's youth wing is the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Gray Wolves]] (''Bozkurtlar'') organization, which is also known as the \"Nationalist Hearths\" (''\u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131'').{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} T\u00fcrke\u015f, who is widely revered by Turkish nationalists as the founder of the idealist movement, is commonly referred to as \"Chieftain\" (''Ba\u015fbu\u011f'') by his supporters.\n\nAlparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f founded the party after criticizing the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) for moving too far away from the nationalist principles of their founder [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], claiming that he would not have founded the MHP had the CHP not deviated from Atat\u00fcrk's ideology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulkuocaklari.org.tr/biz-kimiz-saday-alisov.html|title=Biz Kimiz? \u2013 Ahmet \u015eefki Kuzulu - \u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131 E\u011fitim ve K\u00fclt\u00fcr Vakf\u0131|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302233245/http://www.ulkuocaklari.org.tr/biz-kimiz-saday-alisov.html|archive-date=2017-03-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although T\u00fcrke\u015f failed to win any elections, the MHP won enough seats in the [[1973 Turkish general election|1973]] and [[1977 Turkish general election|1977 general election]] to take part in two coalition governments led by [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] (AP) leader [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]]. T\u00fcrke\u015f served as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey]] between 1975 and 1977 in what was referred to as the [[39th government of Turkey|First Nationalist Front]] government and again between 1977 and 1978 in the [[41st government of Turkey|Second Nationalist Front]]. After T\u00fcrke\u015f's death and the [[1997 Nationalist Movement Party Extraordinary Congress|election]] of Devlet Bah\u00e7eli as his successor, the party moderated its views and adopted a more mainstream nationalist agenda. The party under Bah\u00e7eli's leadership won 18% of the vote and 129 seats in the [[1999 Turkish general election|1999 general election]], its best ever result, coming second only to the [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party]] (DSP). Bah\u00e7eli subsequently became Deputy Prime Minister after [[57th government of Turkey|entering a coalition]] with the DSP and the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] (ANAP), though his calls for an early election resulted in the government's collapse in 2002. In the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 general election]], the MHP fell below the 10% [[election threshold]] and lost all of its parliamentary representation after the newly formed [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) won a plurality.\n\nSince the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]], in which the MHP won back its parliamentary representation with 14.27% of the vote and 71 seats, the party has strongly opposed the [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] between the government and Kurdish separatist militants and has been fiercely critical of the governing AKP over government corruption and authoritarianism. Nevertheless, the MHP has often been referred to critics as the \"AKP's lifeline\", having either openly or covertly helped the AKP in situations such as the [[2007 Turkish presidential election|2007 presidential election]], repealing the headscarf ban and the [[Turkish Parliament Speaker election, June\u2013July 2015|June\u2013July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/turkiye/levent-gok-mhpnin-akpye-can-simidi-olduguna-herkes-tanik-oldu-124609|title=Levent G\u00f6k: MHP'nin, AKP'ye can simidi oldu\u011funa herkes tan\u0131k oldu|date=30 July 2015}}</ref> In the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]], the party's vote fell to 13% and won 53 seats, though increased to 16.3% and 80 seats in the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Having consistently maintained third-party status in Parliament since 2007, the MHP halved its parliamentary representation to win 40 seats with 11.9% of the vote in the [[November 2015 Turkish general election|November 2015 general election]], becoming the fourth largest party in Parliament behind the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP). The MHP supported a 'Yes' vote in the [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017 referendum]], and formed the [[People's Alliance (Turkey)|People's Alliance]] electoral pact with the AKP for the [[2019 Turkish general election|2018 Turkish general election]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Reuters]]|date=21 February 2018|title=Erdogan's AKP says to ally with nationalists for 2019 elections|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-election-regulation/erdogans-akp-says-to-ally-with-nationalists-for-2019-elections-idUSKCN1G52DP}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Before 1980===\nIn 1965, nationalist politician and ex-[[Colonel]] Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f, who had trained in the [[United States]] for [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]], founded the [[Operation Gladio#Turkey|Turkish Gladio]] [[Special Warfare Department]], gained control of the conservative rural [[Republican Villagers Nation Party]] ({{lang-tr|Cumhuriyet\u00e7i K\u00f6yl\u00fc Millet Partisi}}, CKMP).

The MHP used to be described as a neo-fascist party<ref name=\"Arikan1999_122\"/><ref>{{Cite book |first=Tim |last=Jacoby |title=Fascism, Civility and the Crisis of the Turkish State |work=Political Civility in the Middle East |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |page=112}}</ref> linked to extremist and violent militias.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Colleen |last=Sullivan |title=Grey Wolves |work=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism |edition=Second |publisher=Sage |year=2011 |page=236}}</ref> Since the 1990s it has, under the leadership of Devlet Bah\u00e7eli, gradually moderated its programme, turning from [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic]] to [[cultural nationalism]] and conservatism and stressing the unitary nature of the Turkish state. Notably, it has moved from strict, [[Kemalism|Kemalist]]-style secularism to a more pro-Islamic stance, and has &ndash; at least in public statements &ndash; accepted the rules of [[parliamentary democracy]]. Some scholars{{who|date=June 2015}} doubt the sincerity and credibility of this turn and suspect the party of still pursuing a [[fascism|fascist]] agenda behind a more moderate and pro-democratic fa\u00e7ade. Nevertheless, MHP's mainstream overture has strongly increased its appeal to voters and it has grown to the country's third-strongest party,<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Peter |last1=Davies |first2=Paul |last2=Jackson |title=The Far Right in Europe: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Greenwood |year=2008 |page=358}}</ref> continuously represented in the National Assembly since 2007 with voter shares well above the 10% threshold.\n\n===Opposition to the HDP===\nDue to their ideological differences, the MHP is strongly opposed to any form of dialogue with the left-wing Kurdish nationalist Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which Devlet Bah\u00e7eli has often opposed by voting against in Parliament. A notable example was in the June\u2013July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections, where the MHP declared that they would not support any candidate and cast blank votes after the HDP announced support for the Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate [[Deniz Baykal]]. The MHP also ruled out any prospect of a coalition government that receives support from the HDP after the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]], even rejecting CHP leader [[Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu|Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu's]] offer of Bah\u00e7eli becoming Prime Minister in such a coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/kilicdaroglundan-bahceliye-akpnin-koltuk-degnekcisi,301539|title=K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu'ndan Bah\u00e7eli'ye: AKP'nin koltuk de\u011fnek\u00e7isi!}}</ref> MHP deputy leader [[Celal Adan]] claimed that 'even using our party's name in the same sentence as the HDP will be counted as cruelty by us.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cihan.com.tr/tr/partimiz-ile-hdpnin-ayni-cumle-icinde-kullanilmasini-bile-zul-sayariz-1806290.htm|title='Partimiz ile HDP'nin ayn\u0131 c\u00fcmle i\u00e7inde kullan\u0131lmas\u0131n\u0131 bile zul sayar\u0131z'|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063321/https://www.cihan.com.tr/tr/partimiz-ile-hdpnin-ayni-cumle-icinde-kullanilmasini-bile-zul-sayariz-1806290.htm|archive-date=2015-11-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn early September 2015, the MHP and the HDP both voted against the new [[2015 interim election government of Turkey|interim election government]] ministers from taking their oaths of office, causing speculation of whether the MHP was dropping their harsh stance against the HDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/politika/chp-mhp-ve-hdp-ayni-oyu-verdi-tbmmde-yemin-krizi-cikti-1427432/|title=CHP, MHP ve HDP ayn\u0131 oyu verdi, TBMM'de yemin krizi \u00e7\u0131kt\u0131}}</ref> However, [[Semih Yal\u00e7\u0131n]] downplayed any notions of an alliance between the two parties, stating that \"a broken clock will still show the correct time once a day, the HDP can sometimes take a correct decision in Parliament.

The MHP promised to improve the situation of Turkey\u2019s working poor by lifting taxes on diesel and fertiliser, raising the net minimum wage to $518, giving a $37 transportation subsidy to every minimum wage worker, and giving those who cannot afford a house an additional $92 per month in rental aid. The MHP said these policies would allow a minimum wage earner living in a big city to earn as much an extra $646 annually.\n\nThe MHP stated that their economic policies would create 700,000 jobs, increase the national income per person to $13.3K, and increase exports to $238 billion while keeping annual growth at 5.2 percent between 2016 and 2019.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn July 2015, amidst [[Xinjiang conflict#2015 anti-China protests in Turkey|a wave of protests]] against the [[Xinjiang conflict]], MHP-affiliated ''[[\u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131|\u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fc]]'' attacked [[South Korea]]n tourists on Istanbul's [[Sultanahmet Square]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Koreans and Chinese 'both have slanted eyes,' Turkey's nationalist leader says over attacks on tourists |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/koreans-and-chinese-both-have-slanted-eyes-turkeys-nationalist-leader-says-over-attacks-on-tourists.aspx |date=6 July 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> In an interview to Turkish columnist [[Ahmet Hakan]], MHP leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli played the attacks down,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ahmet Hakan |title=Koreans and Chinese 'both have slanted eyes,' Turkey's nationalist leader says over attacks on tourists |work=[[H\u00fcrriyet Daily News]] |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/koreans-and-chinese-both-have-slanted-eyes-turkeys-nationalist-leader-says-over-attacks-on-tourists.aspx |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015|author-link=Ahmet Hakan }}</ref> stating that \"These are young kids.

The party mainly followed a [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] and nationalist political agenda throughout the latter half of the 20th century, but later moderated its views under the leadership of [[Devlet Bah\u00e7eli]], who took over after T\u00fcrke\u015f's death in 1997. The party's youth wing is the [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Gray Wolves]] (''Bozkurtlar'') organization, which is also known as the \"Nationalist Hearths\" (''\u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131'').{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} T\u00fcrke\u015f, who is widely revered by Turkish nationalists as the founder of the idealist movement, is commonly referred to as \"Chieftain\" (''Ba\u015fbu\u011f'') by his supporters.\n\nAlparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f founded the party after criticizing the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) for moving too far away from the nationalist principles of their founder [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], claiming that he would not have founded the MHP had the CHP not deviated from Atat\u00fcrk's ideology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulkuocaklari.org.tr/biz-kimiz-saday-alisov.html|title=Biz Kimiz? \u2013 Ahmet \u015eefki Kuzulu - \u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131 E\u011fitim ve K\u00fclt\u00fcr Vakf\u0131|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302233245/http://www.ulkuocaklari.org.tr/biz-kimiz-saday-alisov.html|archive-date=2017-03-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although T\u00fcrke\u015f failed to win any elections, the MHP won enough seats in the [[1973 Turkish general election|1973]] and [[1977 Turkish general election|1977 general election]] to take part in two coalition governments led by [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] (AP) leader [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]]. T\u00fcrke\u015f served as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey]] between 1975 and 1977 in what was referred to as the [[39th government of Turkey|First Nationalist Front]] government and again between 1977 and 1978 in the [[41st government of Turkey|Second Nationalist Front]]. After T\u00fcrke\u015f's death and the [[1997 Nationalist Movement Party Extraordinary Congress|election]] of Devlet Bah\u00e7eli as his successor, the party moderated its views and adopted a more mainstream nationalist agenda. The party under Bah\u00e7eli's leadership won 18% of the vote and 129 seats in the [[1999 Turkish general election|1999 general election]], its best ever result, coming second only to the [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party]] (DSP). Bah\u00e7eli subsequently became Deputy Prime Minister after [[57th government of Turkey|entering a coalition]] with the DSP and the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] (ANAP), though his calls for an early election resulted in the government's collapse in 2002. In the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 general election]], the MHP fell below the 10% [[election threshold]] and lost all of its parliamentary representation after the newly formed [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) won a plurality.\n\nSince the [[2007 Turkish general election|2007 general election]], in which the MHP won back its parliamentary representation with 14.27% of the vote and 71 seats, the party has strongly opposed the [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] between the government and Kurdish separatist militants and has been fiercely critical of the governing AKP over government corruption and authoritarianism. Nevertheless, the MHP has often been referred to critics as the \"AKP's lifeline\", having either openly or covertly helped the AKP in situations such as the [[2007 Turkish presidential election|2007 presidential election]], repealing the headscarf ban and the [[Turkish Parliament Speaker election, June\u2013July 2015|June\u2013July 2015 parliamentary speaker elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/turkiye/levent-gok-mhpnin-akpye-can-simidi-olduguna-herkes-tanik-oldu-124609|title=Levent G\u00f6k: MHP'nin, AKP'ye can simidi oldu\u011funa herkes tan\u0131k oldu|date=30 July 2015}}</ref> In the [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]], the party's vote fell to 13% and won 53 seats, though increased to 16.3% and 80 seats in the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|June 2015 general election]]. Having consistently maintained third-party status in Parliament since 2007, the MHP halved its parliamentary representation to win 40 seats with 11.9% of the vote in the [[November 2015 Turkish general election|November 2015 general election]], becoming the fourth largest party in Parliament behind the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP).

He described himself in these words: \"I am a fighter against oppression and injustice, whether practised by bureaucrats, zamindars, capitalists or those of high caste. I have fought all my life against oppression against inhumanity and may God give me strength to fight on till the last\".\n\nGanesh Shankar was born in a Hindu [[Kayastha]] family at Hathgaon/Hathgam in Fatehpur District . This is also the birthplace of renowned Urdu poet Shri Iqbal Verma and it is said, this was populated by Saint Parashar. His father Jai Narain, also spelled as Jainarayan, was a teacher in a middle school namely Anglo Vernacular School<ref>{{cite book|title= Ganesh Shankar Vidharthi Samajik Chetna Ke sarthi|author=Neeraj Shukla|publisher=Lokvani Prakashan Delhi|page=25|isbn=9789381487853}}</ref> in Mungaoli which is now the tehsil of Ashoknagar district of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. He was poor but a deeply religious [[Hindu]] and dedicated to high ideals. It was under him that Ganesh Shankar received his early schooling and passed the high school examination privately in 1907 after studying in [[Mungeli|Mungaoli]] and [[Vidisha]]. His admission register is available in this school. He could not study further due to poverty and became a clerk in the currency office and later a teacher in high school in [[Kanpur]]. At age 16, he also wrote his first book ''Hamari Atmogsargart'' and wed his wife Chandraprakashwati Vidyarthi on 4 June 1909.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/ganesh-shankar-vidyarthi-penman-in-the-battle-against-communalism/15905350.shtml|title=Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi: Penman in the battle against communalism|date=18 April 2015|publisher=merinews.com|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis real interest, however, was in journalism and public life and he came early under the influence of the nationalist upsurge, which was taking place in the country. He became an agent of the well-known revolutionary Hindi and Urdu journals \u2013 Karamyogi and Swarajya and also began to contribute to them. He adopted the pen-name 'Vidyarthi' \u2013 the seeker of knowledge. He attracted the notice of Pt. Mahabir Prasad Dwiwedi, the doyen of Hindi journalism who offered him the job of a sub-editor in his famous literary monthly, \"The Saraswati\", in 1911. Ganesh Shankar, however, was more interested in current affairs and politics and therefore joined the Hindi weekly \"Abhyudaya\" a political journal of the time. He thus served his apprenticeship under two of the greatest figures in Hindi literature and journalism of the time.\n\nIn 1913 Ganesh Shankar came back to Kanpur and launched his career of a crusading journalist and freedom fighter, which was only to end with his death 18 years later. He founded 'Pratap', his famous revolutionary weekly, which identified itself with the cause of the oppressed wherever they might be and ''Pratap'' would prove to be widespread as its circulation jumped from five hundred in 1913 to six hundred in 1916.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burton |first1=Antoinette |authorlink1=Antoinette Burton |last2=Hofmeyr |first2=Isabel |date=2014 |title=Ten Books That Shaped the British Empire: Creating an Imperial Commons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwedBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT200|publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |page= |isbn=978-0822375920 }}</ref> It was through this paper that he waged his famous fights for the oppressed peasants of [[Rae Bareli]], the workers of the [[Kanpur]] mills and the downtrodden people of Indian states.

His blood is the cement that will ultimately bind the two communities. No pact will bind our hearts. But heroism such as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi showed is bound in the end to melt the stoniest hearts, melt them into one.
