Since the second challenge (third episode) of Season 1, the program team will assign the captain '''(\uc8fc\uc7a5)''' of the period in response to the performance of the members of the previous challenge, and the captain will receive an armband. Prior to arriving at the location, members will wear eye masks, and the staff will lead the members to the start point in the large secret room. After fulfilling the instructions of the staff, the members can remove the eye mask. In each challenge, members need to use the clues in the room to gradually explore the large secret room until all members escape from the location.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape/3/Contents/Html|title=Introduction to Great Escape (Season 1)|website=tvN|lang=ko|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719084306/http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape/3/Contents/Html|archivedate=19 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEach challenge has a different theme, and members will learn about the context of the background story from the clues during the exploration. In addition to finding and cracking the clues, members may need to interact with the story characters played by the staff (such as helping the character, leading the character to escape, etc.) before they can escape from the large secret room. There is no stipulated time limit for each escape challenge, it will only end when all members and story characters (if any) have successfully escaped.\n\nFor Season 2, a major change being added to the show is that there is a possibility of failure to escape. The recording of the challenge ends once it happens. Another added change is that there is a possibility that cast member(s) would get eliminated in the midst of escaping, based on situations (e.g. \"dead\" or \"missing\" during the attempt) and the decisions of the production team. The eliminated cast member(s) will get off from work.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape2/7/Contents/Html|title=Introduction to Great Escape (Season 2)|website=tvN|lang=ko|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719084414/http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape2/7/Contents/Html|archivedate=19 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> There is no longer any assignment of the captain '''(\uc8fc\uc7a5)'''.\n\n==Slogan==\nThe slogan of the show is '''\"\ub098\uac00\uc57c\uc0b0\ub2e4\"''' (Escape and Survive) as shown in the promotional poster for Season 1.\n\n==Airtime==\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!Season!!Airdate!!Broadcast Start Time\n|-\n|1||1 July \u2013 23 September 2018||rowspan=3|Sundays 10:40 pm (KST)\n|-\n|2||17 March \u2013 9 June 2019\n|-\n|3||1 March 2020 \u2013 present\n|-\n|}\n{{-}}\n==Cast==\n===Season 1===\n{{hidden begin\n|title=List of Cast (Season 1)\n|titlestyle=background:lightGray\n}}\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!

each phase of the escape challenge, the members first gather in the bus. Since the second challenge (third episode) of Season 1, the program team will assign the captain '''(\uc8fc\uc7a5)''' of the period in response to the performance of the members of the previous challenge, and the captain will receive an armband. Prior to arriving at the location, members will wear eye masks, and the staff will lead the members to the start point in the large secret room. After fulfilling the instructions of the staff, the members can remove the eye mask. In each challenge, members need to use the clues in the room to gradually explore the large secret room until all members escape from the location.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape/3/Contents/Html|title=Introduction to Great Escape (Season 1)|website=tvN|lang=ko|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719084306/http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape/3/Contents/Html|archivedate=19 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEach challenge has a different theme, and members will learn about the context of the background story from the clues during the exploration. In addition to finding and cracking the clues, members may need to interact with the story characters played by the staff (such as helping the character, leading the character to escape, etc.) before they can escape from the large secret room. There is no stipulated time limit for each escape challenge, it will only end when all members and story characters (if any) have successfully escaped.\n\nFor Season 2, a major change being added to the show is that there is a possibility of failure to escape. The recording of the challenge ends once it happens. Another added change is that there is a possibility that cast member(s) would get eliminated in the midst of escaping, based on situations (e.g. \"dead\" or \"missing\" during the attempt) and the decisions of the production team. The eliminated cast member(s) will get off from work.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape2/7/Contents/Html|title=Introduction to Great Escape (Season 2)|website=tvN|lang=ko|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719084414/http://program.tving.com/tvn/greatescape2/7/Contents/Html|archivedate=19 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> There is no longer any assignment of the captain '''(\uc8fc\uc7a5)'''.\n\n==Slogan==\nThe slogan of the show is '''\"\ub098\uac00\uc57c\uc0b0\ub2e4\"''' (Escape and Survive) as shown in the promotional poster for Season 1.\n\n==Airtime==\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!Season!!Airdate!!Broadcast Start Time\n|-\n|1||1 July \u2013 23 September 2018||rowspan=3|Sundays 10:40 pm (KST)\n|-\n|2||17 March \u2013 9 June 2019\n|-\n|3||1 March 2020 \u2013 present\n|-\n|}\n{{-}}\n==Cast==\n===Season 1===\n{{hidden begin\n|title=List of Cast (Season 1)\n|titlestyle=background:lightGray\n}}\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. A slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0 for strings not in the language and error probability less than 1/2 for strings in the language. Loosening the error requirements further yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 1/3. '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. The broadest class of probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0. Intuitively, this is the strictest class of probabilistic problems because it demands ''no error whatsoever''. A slightly looser class is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 0 for strings not in the language and error probability less than 1/2 for strings in the language. Loosening the error requirements further yields the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine with error probability 1/3. '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown. The broadest class of probabilistic problems is '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''', the set of languages solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability of less than 1/2 for all strings.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the language <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class because it turns out that it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

{"title_page": "Courier", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{update|date=May 2016}}\n{{lead too short|date=May 2016}}\n}}\n\nA '''courier''' is a company, an employee of that company or a person who delivers a message, package or letter from one place or person to another place or person.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/courier|title=COURIER {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nCouriers are distinguished from ordinary [[mail]] services by features such as speed, security, tracking, signature, specialization and individualization of express services, and swift delivery times, which are optional for most everyday mail services. As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is normally limited to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost.\n\nCourier services operate on all scales, from within specific towns or cities, to regional, national and global services. Large courier companies include [[DHL Express|DHL]], [[Postaplus]], [[DTDC]], [[FedEx]], [[EMS International]], [[TNT Express|TNT]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[India Post]] and [[Aramex]]. These offer services worldwide, typically via a [[hub and spoke]] model.\n\nCouriers services utilizing [[Courier software|Courier Software]] provide electronic [[Proof of delivery|Proof of Delivery]] and electronic Tracking details.\n\n==Before the industrial era==\n[[File:Beato courier or postman.jpg|thumb|A [[hiyaku]] (''courier or postman''), Japan, [[hand-colouring|hand-coloured]] albumen print by [[Felice Beato]], between 1863 and 1877]]\n[[File:Courrier.jpg|thumb|Japanese military [[Bicycle messenger|bike courier]] pursued by Cossacks (1904). On foot, military couriers are known as [[runner (soldier)|runners]].]]\n\nIn ancient history, messages were hand-delivered using a variety of methods, including [[runner (soldier)|runners]], [[pigeon post|homing pigeon]]s and riders on horseback. Before the introduction of mechanized courier services, foot messengers physically ran miles to their destinations. [[Xenophon]] attributed the first use of couriers to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] prince [[Cyrus the Younger]].\n\nFamously, the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] courier [[Pheidippides]] is said to have run 26 miles from [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] to [[Athens]] to bring the news of the [[Battle of Marathon|Greek victory over the Persians]] in 490 BCE. The long-distance race known as a [[marathon]] is named for this run.\n\n=== Anabasii ===\nStarting at the time of [[Augustus]], the ancient Greeks and Romans made use of a class of horse and [[chariot]]-mounted couriers called ''anabasii'' to quickly bring messages and commands long distances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0129|title=Cyclop\u00e6dia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences: Alguazil - anagram|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref> The word ''anabasii'' comes from the Greek ''\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2'' (''adscensus'', \"mounting\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/hofmann/hof1/s0192b.html|title=Lexicon Universale: ANA-|last=Hofmann|first=Johann Jacob|website=www.uni-mannheim.de|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref> They were contemporary with the Greek ''hemeredromi'', who carried their messages by foot.\n\nIn [[Roman Britain]], [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] made use of anabasii, as documented in [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]'s memoirs (''adv. Ruffinum'', l. 3. c. 1.): \"Idcircone Cereales et Anabasii tui per diversas provincias cucurrerunt, ut laudes meas legerent?\" (\"Is it on that account that your Cereales and Anabasii circulated through many provinces, so that they might read my praises?\")\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], royal courts maintained their own messengers who were paid little more than common labourers.\n\n==Types==\nIn cities, there are often [[bicycle messenger|bicycle couriers]] or [[motorcycle courier]]s but for consignments requiring delivery over greater distance networks, this may often include [[Trucks]], [[railroads]] and [[aircraft]].\n\nMany companies who operate under a [[Just In Time (business)|Just-In-Time]] or \"JIT\" inventory method often use on-board couriers (OBCs). On-board couriers are individuals who can travel at a moment's notice anywhere in the world, usually via commercial airlines. While this type of service is the second costliest\u2014[[general aviation]] charters are far more expensive\u2014companies analyze the cost of service to engage an on-board courier versus the \"cost\" the company will realize should the product not arrive by a specified time (an assembly line stopping, untimely court filing, lost sales from product or components missing a delivery deadline, organ transplants).\n\n==By country==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe courier business in Australia is a very competitive industry and is mainly concentrated in the high population areas in and around the capital cities. With such a vast mass of land to cover the courier companies tend to transport either by air or by the main transport routes and national highways. The only large company that provides a country-wide service is Australia Post.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== China ===\nInternational courier services in China include [[TNT EXpress|TNT]], [[EMS International]], [[DHL Express|DHL]], [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]. These companies provide nominal worldwide service for both inbound and outbound shipments, connecting China to countries such as the US, Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Of the international courier services, the Dutch company TNT is considered to have the most capable local fluency and efficacy for third- and fourth- tiered cities. EMS International is a unit of China Post, and as such is not available for shipments originating outside of China.\n\nDomestic courier services include [[SF Express]], YTO Express (\u5706\u901a), E-EMS (E\u90ae\u5b9d) and many other operators of sometimes microscopic scales. E-EMS, is the special product of a co-operative arrangement between [[China Post]] and [[Alipay (payment platform)|Alipay]], which is the online payment unit of [[Alibaba Group]]. It is only available for the delivery of online purchases made using Alipay.\n\nWithin the Municipality of Beijing, TongCheng KuaiDi (\u540c\u57ce\u5feb\u9012), also a unit of China Post, provides intra-city service using [[cargo bicycles]].\n\n=== India ===\nInternational courier services in India include [[DHL]], [[The Professional Couirer's(Domestic & International )]], [[FedEx]], [[Blue Dart Express]], [[Skyroute Worldwide]], [[Ekart]], [[DTDC]], [[DABH LOGISTIC]], [[VRL Group#Cargo and Courier|VRL Courier Services]], [[Flyking Courier]], [[Shadowfax Technologies]] and Delhivery. Apart from these, several local couriers also operate across India. Almost all of these couriers can be tracked online. [[India Post]] is another major courier service with around 155 thousand branches (comprising 139 thousand (90%) in rural areas and 16 thousand (10%) in urban areas).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiapost.gov.in/VAS/Pages/AboutUs/PostOfficeNetwork.aspx|title=India Post|website=indiapost.gov.in/VAS/Pages/AboutUs/PostOfficeNetwork.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nThe main courier services available in Ireland as alternatives to the national [[An Post]] system are [[Parcel Direct Ireland]], SnapParcel, [[DHL]], UPS, [[TNT Express|TNT]], [[Dynamic Parcel Distribution|DPD]] and FedEx.\n\n===Singapore===\nThere are several international courier companies in Singapore including TNT, DHL and FedEx. Despite being a small country, demand is high for courier services. Many local courier companies have sprung up to meet this demand. Most courier companies in Singapore focus on local deliveries instead of international freight.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe genus of the UK sameday courier market stems from the London Taxi companies but soon expanded into dedicated motorcycle despatch riders with the taxi companies setting up separate arms to their companies to cover the courier work. During the late 1970s small provincial and regional companies were popping up throughout the country. Today, there are many large companies offering next-day courier services, including [[DX Group]], [[UKMail]] and UK divisions of worldwide couriers such as FedEx, DHL, Global Express Courier, UPS and TNT City Sprint.\n\nThere are many 'specialist' couriers usually for the transportation of items such as freight/palettes, sensitive documents and liquids.\n\nThe 'Man & Van'/Freelance courier business model, is highly popular in the United Kingdom, with thousands upon thousands of independent couriers and localised companies, offering next-day and same day services. This is likely to be so popular because of the low business requirements (a vehicle) and the lucrative number of items sent within the UK every day. However, since the dawn of the electronic age the way in which businesses use couriers has changed dramatically. Prior to email and the ability to create PDFs, documents represented a significant proportion of the business. However, over the past five years,{{when|date=December 2018}} documentation revenues have decreased by 50 percent. Customers are also demanding more from their courier partners. Therefore, more organisations prefer to use the services of larger organisations who are able to provide more flexibility and levels of service, which has led to another level of courier company, regional couriers. This is usually a local company which has expanded to more than one office to cover an area.\n\nSome UK couriers offer next-day services to other European countries. FedEx offers next-day air delivery to many EU countries. Cheaper 'by-road' options are also available, varying from two days' delivery time (such as France), to up to a week (former USSR countries).\n\nLarge couriers often require an account to be held (and this can include daily scheduled collections). Senders are therefore primarily in the commercial/industrial sector (and not the general public); some couriers such as DHL do however allow public sending (at higher cost than regular senders).\n\nIn recent years, the increased popularity of Black Friday in the UK has placed some firms under operational stress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7acf8a4e-9ef3-11e4-ba25-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|website=Financial Times|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe process of booking a courier has changed, it is no longer a lengthy task of making numerous calls to different courier companies to request a quote. Booking a courier is predominantly carried out online. The courier industry has been quick to adapt to our ever-changing digital landscape, meeting the needs of mobile and desktop consumers as well as e-commerce and online retailers. Offering end users access to instant online payments, parcel tracking, delivery notifications, and the convenience of door to door collection and delivery to almost any destination in the world.\n\n===United States===\n\nThe courier industry has long held an important place in [[United States]] commerce and has been involved in pivotal moments in the nation's history such as westward migration and the [[gold rush]]. [[Wells Fargo]] was founded in 1852 and rapidly became the preeminent package delivery company. The company specialised in shipping gold, packages and newspapers throughout the West, making a Wells Fargo office in every camp and settlement a necessity for commerce and connections to home. Shortly afterward, the [[Pony Express]] was established to move packages more quickly than the traditional [[stagecoach]]. It illustrated the demand for timely deliveries across the nation, a concept that continued to evolve with the [[railroad]]s, automobiles and interstate highways and which has emerged into today's courier industry.\n\nThe courier industry in United States is a $59 billion industry, with 90% of the business shared by DHL, FedEx, UPS and USA Couriers. On the other hand, regional and/or local courier and delivery services were highly diversified and tended to be smaller operations; the top 50 firms accounted for just a third of the sector's revenues.

As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is normally limited to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost.\n\nCourier services operate on all scales, from within specific towns or cities, to regional, national and global services. Large courier companies include [[DHL Express|DHL]], [[Postaplus]], [[DTDC]], [[FedEx]], [[EMS International]], [[TNT Express|TNT]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[India Post]] and [[Aramex]]. These offer services worldwide, typically via a [[hub and spoke]] model.\n\nCouriers services utilizing [[Courier software|Courier Software]] provide electronic [[Proof of delivery|Proof of Delivery]] and electronic Tracking details.\n\n==Before the industrial era==\n[[File:Beato courier or postman.jpg|thumb|''Courier or postman'', Japan, [[hand-colouring|hand-coloured]] albumen print by [[Felice Beato]], between 1863 and 1877]]\n[[File:Courrier.jpg|thumb|Japanese military [[Bicycle messenger|bike courier]] pursued by Cossacks (1904). On foot, military couriers are known as [[runner (soldier)|runners]].]]\n\nIn ancient history, messages were hand-delivered using a variety of methods, including [[runner (soldier)|runners]], [[pigeon post|homing pigeon]]s and riders on horseback. Before the introduction of mechanized courier services, foot messengers physically ran miles to their destinations. [[Xenophon]] attributed the first use of couriers to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] prince [[Cyrus the Younger]].\n\nFamously, the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] courier [[Pheidippides]] is said to have run 26 miles from [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] to [[Athens]] to bring the news of the [[Battle of Marathon|Greek victory over the Persians]] in 490 BCE. The long-distance race known as a [[marathon]] is named for this run.\n\n=== Anabasii ===\nStarting at the time of [[Augustus]], the ancient Greeks and Romans made use of a class of horse and [[chariot]]-mounted couriers called ''anabasii'' to quickly bring messages and commands long distances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0129|title=Cyclop\u00e6dia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences: Alguazil - anagram|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref> The word ''anabasii'' comes from the Greek ''\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2'' (''adscensus'', \"mounting\").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/hofmann/hof1/s0192b.html|title=Lexicon Universale: ANA-|last=Hofmann|first=Johann Jacob|website=www.uni-mannheim.de|access-date=2017-03-10}}</ref> They were contemporary with the Greek ''hemeredromi'', who carried their messages by foot.\n\nIn [[Roman Britain]], [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] made use of anabasii, as documented in [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]'s memoirs (''adv. Ruffinum'', l. 3. c. 1.): \"Idcircone Cereales et Anabasii tui per diversas provincias cucurrerunt, ut laudes meas legerent?\" (\"Is it on that account that your Cereales and Anabasii circulated through many provinces, so that they might read my praises?\")\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], royal courts maintained their own messengers who were paid little more than common labourers.\n\n==Types==\nIn cities, there are often [[bicycle messenger|bicycle couriers]] or [[motorcycle courier]]s but for consignments requiring delivery over greater distance networks, this may often include [[Trucks]], [[railroads]] and [[aircraft]].\n\nMany companies who operate under a [[Just In Time (business)|Just-In-Time]] or \"JIT\" inventory method often use on-board couriers (OBCs). On-board couriers are individuals who can travel at a moment's notice anywhere in the world, usually via commercial airlines. While this type of service is the second costliest\u2014[[general aviation]] charters are far more expensive\u2014companies analyze the cost of service to engage an on-board courier versus the \"cost\" the company will realize should the product not arrive by a specified time (an assembly line stopping, untimely court filing, lost sales from product or components missing a delivery deadline, organ transplants).\n\n==By country==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe courier business in Australia is a very competitive industry and is mainly concentrated in the high population areas in and around the capital cities. With such a vast mass of land to cover the courier companies tend to transport either by air or by the main transport routes and national highways. The only large company that provides a country-wide service is Australia Post.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== China ===\nInternational courier services in China include [[TNT EXpress|TNT]], [[EMS International]], [[DHL Express|DHL]], [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]. These companies provide nominal worldwide service for both inbound and outbound shipments, connecting China to countries such as the US, Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Of the international courier services, the Dutch company TNT is considered to have the most capable local fluency and efficacy for third- and fourth- tiered cities. EMS International is a unit of China Post, and as such is not available for shipments originating outside of China.\n\nDomestic courier services include [[SF Express]], YTO Express (\u5706\u901a), E-EMS (E\u90ae\u5b9d) and many other operators of sometimes microscopic scales. E-EMS, is the special product of a co-operative arrangement between [[China Post]] and [[Alipay (payment platform)|Alipay]], which is the online payment unit of [[Alibaba Group]]. It is only available for the delivery of online purchases made using Alipay.\n\nWithin the Municipality of Beijing, TongCheng KuaiDi (\u540c\u57ce\u5feb\u9012), also a unit of China Post, provides intra-city service using [[cargo bicycles]].\n\n=== India ===\nInternational courier services in India include [[DHL]], [[The Professional Couirer's(Domestic & International )]], [[FedEx]], [[Blue Dart Express]], [[Skyroute Worldwide]], [[Ekart]], [[DTDC]], [[DABH LOGISTIC]], [[VRL Group#Cargo and Courier|VRL Courier Services]], [[Flyking Courier]], [[Shadowfax Technologies]] and Delhivery. Apart from these, several local couriers also operate across India. Almost all of these couriers can be tracked online. [[India Post]] is another major courier service with around 155 thousand branches (comprising 139 thousand (90%) in rural areas and 16 thousand (10%) in urban areas).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiapost.gov.in/VAS/Pages/AboutUs/PostOfficeNetwork.aspx|title=India Post|website=indiapost.gov.in/VAS/Pages/AboutUs/PostOfficeNetwork.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nThe main courier services available in Ireland as alternatives to the national [[An Post]] system are [[Parcel Direct Ireland]], SnapParcel, [[DHL]], UPS, [[TNT Express|TNT]], [[Dynamic Parcel Distribution|DPD]] and FedEx.\n\n===Singapore===\nThere are several international courier companies in Singapore including TNT, DHL and FedEx. Despite being a small country, demand is high for courier services. Many local courier companies have sprung up to meet this demand. Most courier companies in Singapore focus on local deliveries instead of international freight.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe genus of the UK sameday courier market stems from the London Taxi companies but soon expanded into dedicated motorcycle despatch riders with the taxi companies setting up separate arms to their companies to cover the courier work. During the late 1970s small provincial and regional companies were popping up throughout the country. Today, there are many large companies offering next-day courier services, including [[DX Group]], [[UKMail]] and UK divisions of worldwide couriers such as FedEx, DHL, Global Express Courier, UPS and TNT City Sprint.\n\nThere are many 'specialist' couriers usually for the transportation of items such as freight/palettes, sensitive documents and liquids.\n\nThe 'Man & Van'/Freelance courier business model, is highly popular in the United Kingdom, with thousands upon thousands of independent couriers and localised companies, offering next-day and same day services. This is likely to be so popular because of the low business requirements (a vehicle) and the lucrative number of items sent within the UK every day. However, since the dawn of the electronic age the way in which businesses use couriers has changed dramatically. Prior to email and the ability to create PDFs, documents represented a significant proportion of the business. However, over the past five years,{{when|date=December 2018}} documentation revenues have decreased by 50 percent. Customers are also demanding more from their courier partners. Therefore, more organisations prefer to use the services of larger organisations who are able to provide more flexibility and levels of service, which has led to another level of courier company, regional couriers. This is usually a local company which has expanded to more than one office to cover an area.\n\nSome UK couriers offer next-day services to other European countries. FedEx offers next-day air delivery to many EU countries. Cheaper 'by-road' options are also available, varying from two days' delivery time (such as France), to up to a week (former USSR countries).\n\nLarge couriers often require an account to be held (and this can include daily scheduled collections). Senders are therefore primarily in the commercial/industrial sector (and not the general public); some couriers such as DHL do however allow public sending (at higher cost than regular senders).\n\nIn recent years, the increased popularity of Black Friday in the UK has placed some firms under operational stress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7acf8a4e-9ef3-11e4-ba25-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|author=|date=|website=Financial Times|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe process of booking a courier has changed, it is no longer a lengthy task of making numerous calls to different courier companies to request a quote. Booking a courier is predominantly carried out online. The courier industry has been quick to adapt to our ever-changing digital landscape, meeting the needs of mobile and desktop consumers as well as e-commerce and online retailers. Offering end users access to instant online payments, parcel tracking, delivery notifications, and the convenience of door to door collection and delivery to almost any destination in the world.\n\n===United States===\n\nThe courier industry has long held an important place in [[United States]] commerce and has been involved in pivotal moments in the nation's history such as westward migration and the [[gold rush]]. [[Wells Fargo]] was founded in 1852 and rapidly became the preeminent package delivery company. The company specialised in shipping gold, packages and newspapers throughout the West, making a Wells Fargo office in every camp and settlement a necessity for commerce and connections to home. Shortly afterward, the [[Pony Express]] was established to move packages more quickly than the traditional [[stagecoach]]. It illustrated the demand for timely deliveries across the nation, a concept that continued to evolve with the [[railroad]]s, automobiles and interstate highways and which has emerged into today's courier industry.\n\nThe courier industry in United States is a $59 billion industry, with 90% of the business shared by DHL, FedEx, UPS and USA Couriers.

Microfinance includes [[microcredit]], the provision of small loans to poor clients; [[savings account|savings]] and [[checking account]]s; [[microinsurance]]; and [[payment system]]s, among other branches.<ref name=\"biznewsdaily\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4286-microfinance.html|title=Microfinance: What It Is and Why It Matters|last=Caramela|first=Sammi|date=23 April 2018|website=Business News Daily|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"investopedia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microfinance.asp|last=Kagan|first=Julia|date=7 June 2018|website=Investopedia|accessdate=16 February 2019|title=Microfinance}}</ref> Microfinance services are designed to reach excluded customers, usually poorer population segments, possibly socially marginalized, or geographically more isolated, and to help them become self-sufficient.<ref name=\"investopedia\"/><ref name=\"christen-rosenberg-jayadeva\">Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg & Veena Jayadeva.  ''[[Financial institutions]] with a [[Double bottom line|double-bottom line]]:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  [[Partnership|CGAP]] Occasional Paper, July 2004, pp. 2-3.</ref>\n\nMicrofinance initially had a limited definition - the provision of microloans to poor entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to [[credit]]. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were: (1) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and (2) group-based models, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger [[social movement|movement]] whose object is \"a world in which as everyone, especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and [[Electronic funds transfer|fund transfers]].\"<ref name=\"christen-rosenberg-jayadeva\"/>\n\nProponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help poor people out of [[poverty]], including participants in the [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]]. For many, microfinance is a way to promote economic development, employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses; for others it is a way for the poor to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks. Critics often point to some of the ills of micro-credit that can create indebtedness. Due to diverse contexts in which microfinance operates, and the broad range of microfinance services, it is neither possible nor wise to have a generalized view of impacts microfinance may create. Many studies have tried to assess its impacts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feigenberg|first=Benjamin|author2=Erica M.

This is often the case when people need the services money can provide but do not have dispensable funds required for those services, forcing them to revert to other means of acquiring them.\nIn their book ''The Poor and Their Money'', Stuart Rutherford and Sukhwinder Arora cite several types of needs:\n* ''Lifecycle Needs'':  such as weddings, funerals, childbirth, education, home building, widowhood and old age.\n* ''Personal Emergencies'':  such as sickness, injury, unemployment, theft, harassment or death.\n* ''Disasters'':  such as wildfires, floods, cyclones and man-made events like war or bulldozing of dwellings.\n* ''Investment Opportunities'':  expanding a business, buying land or equipment, improving housing, securing a job, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rutherford | first1 = Stuart | last2 = Arora | first2 = Sukhwinder | title = The poor and their money: micro finance from a twenty-first century consumer's perspective | page = 4 | publisher = Practical Action | location = Warwickshire, UK | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781853396885 }}</ref>\nPeople find creative and often collaborative ways to meet these needs, primarily through creating and exchanging different forms of non-cash value. Common substitutes for cash vary from country to country but typically include livestock, grains, jewelry and precious metals.\nAs Marguerite S. Robinson describes in his book 'The Micro finance Revolution - Sustainable Finance for the Poor', the 1980s demonstrated that \"micro finance could provide large-scale outreach profitably,\" and in the 1990s, \"micro finance began to develop as an industry\" (2001, p.&nbsp;54).\nIn the 2000s, the micro [https://www.letsdiskuss.com/what-is-supply-chain-finance finance] industry's objective is to satisfy the unmet [[demand]] on a much larger scale, and to play a role in reducing poverty. While much progress has been made in developing a viable, commercial micro finance sector in the last few decades, several issues remain that need to be addressed before the industry will be able to satisfy massive worldwide demand.\nThe obstacles or challenges in building a sound commercial micro finance industry include:\n* Inappropriate donor [[subsidies]]\n* Poor regulation and supervision of deposit-taking micro finance institutions (MFIs)\n* Few MFIs that meet the needs for savings, remittances or insurance\n* Limited management capacity in MFIs\n* Institutional inefficiencies\n* Need for more dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural micro finance methodologies\n* Members lack of collateral to secure a loan\n\nMicrofinance is the proper tool to reduce income inequality, allowing citizens from lower socio-economical classes to participate in the economy. Moreover, its involvement has shown to lead to a downward trend in income inequality (Hermes, 2014).<ref>Hermes, N. (2014). Does microfinance affect income inequality? Applied Economics, 46(9), 1021-1034. doi:10.1080/00036846.2013.864039</ref>\n\n===Ways in which poor people manage their money===\n\n[[File:Saving up.jpg|thumb|Saving up]]\nRutherford argues that the basic problem that poor people face as money managers is to gather a 'usefully large' amount of money. Building a new home may involve saving and protecting diverse building materials for years until enough are available to proceed with construction. Children's schooling may be funded by buying chickens and raising them for sale as needed for expenses, uniforms, bribes, etc. Because all the value is accumulated before it is needed, this money management strategy is referred to as 'saving up'.(Hermes, 2014).<ref>Rutherford, Stuart. The poor and their money. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nOften, people don't have enough money when they face a need, so they borrow. A poor family might borrow from relatives to buy land, from a moneylender to buy rice, or from a microfinance institution to buy a sewing machine. Since these loans must be repaid by saving after the cost is incurred, Rutherford calls this 'saving down'. Rutherford's point is that microcredit is addressing only half the problem, and arguably the less important half: poor people borrow to help them save and accumulate assets. Microcredit institutions should fund their loans through savings accounts that help poor people manage their myriad risks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Saving down.jpg|left|thumb|Saving down]]\nMost needs are met through a mix of saving and credit. A benchmark impact assessment of [[Grameen Bank]] and two other large microfinance institutions in Bangladesh found that for every $1 they were lending to clients to finance rural non-farm [[micro-enterprise]], about $2.50 came from other sources, mostly their clients' savings.<ref>{{cite book | last = Khandker | first = Shahidur R. | title = Fighting poverty with microcredit: experience in Bangladesh | page = 78 | publisher = The University Press Ltd. | location = Dhaka, Bangladesh | year = 1999 | isbn = 9789840514687 }}</ref>  This parallels the experience in the West, in which family businesses are funded mostly from savings, especially during start-up.\n\nRecent studies have also shown that informal methods of saving are unsafe. For example, a study by Wright and Mutesasira in [[Uganda]] concluded that \"those with no option but to save in the informal sector are almost bound to lose some money\u2014probably around one quarter of what they save there.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Graham A.

The new paradigm places more attention on the efforts of poor people to reduce their many vulnerabilities by keeping more of what they earn and building up their assets. While they need loans, they may find it as useful to borrow for consumption as for microenterprise. A safe, flexible place to save money and withdraw it when needed is also essential for managing household and family risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Examples===\nThe microfinance project of \"saving up\" is exemplified in the slums of the south-eastern city of Vijayawada, India. This microfinance project functions as an unofficial banking system where Jyothi, a \"deposit collector\", collects money from slum dwellers, mostly women, in order for them to accumulate savings. Jyothi does her rounds throughout the city, collecting Rs5 a day from people in the slums for 220 days, however not always 220 days in a row since these women do not always have the funds available to put them into savings. They ultimately end up with Rs1000 at the end of the process. However, there are some issues with this microfinance saving program. One of the issues is that while saving, clients are actually losing part of their savings. Jyothi takes interest from each client\u2014about 20 out of every 220 payments, or Rs100 out of 1,100 or 8%. When these slum dwellers find someone they trust, they are willing to pay up to 30% to someone to safely collect and keep their savings. There is also the risk of entrusting their savings to unlicensed, informal, peripatetic collectors. However, the slum dwellers are willing to accept this risk because they are unable to save at home, and unable to use the remote and unfriendly banks in their country. This microfinance project also has many benefits, such as empowering women and giving parents the ability to save money for their children's education. This specific microfinance project is an example of the benefits and limitations of the \"saving up\" project (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThe microfinance project of \"saving through\" is shown in Nairobi, Kenya which includes a Rotating Savings and Credit Associations or ROSCAs initiative. This is a small scale example, however Rutherford (2009) describes a woman he met in Nairobi and studied her ROSCA. Everyday 15 women would save 100 shillings so there would be a lump sum of 1,500 shillings and everyday 1 of the 15 women would receive that lump sum. This would continue for 15 days and another woman within this group would receive the lump sum. At the end of the 15 days a new cycle would start. This ROSCA initiative is different from the \"saving up\" example above because there are no interest rates affiliated with the ROSCA, additionally everyone receives back what they put forth. This initiative requires trust and social capital networks in order to work, so often these ROSCAs include people who know each other and have reciprocity. The ROSCA allows for marginalized groups to receive a lump sum at one time in order to pay or save for specific needs they have.\n\n==Microfinance debates and challenges==\n\nThere are several key debates at the boundaries of microfinance.\n\n===Loan Pricing===\n[[File:A business in South Sudan benefiting from microfinance (6189731244).jpg|thumb|This shop in [[South Sudan]] was opened using money borrowed from the Finance Sudan Limited (FSL) Program. This program was established in 2006 as one of the only microfinance lenders in the country.]]\n\nBefore determining loan price one should take these two costs; Administrative costs by the bank(MFI) and transaction cost by the client/customer. Customers, on the other hand, may have expenses for travelling to the bank branch, acquiring official documents for the loan application, and loss of time when dealing with the MFI (\u201copportunity costs\u201d). Hence, from a customer's point of view the cost of a loan is not only the interest and fees she/he has to pay, but also all other transaction costs that she/he has to cover.\n\nOne of the principal challenges of microfinance is providing small loans at an affordable cost. The global average interest and fee rate is estimated at 37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/14microfinance.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | title=Banks Making Big Profits From Tiny Loans | date=2010-04-13}}</ref>  The reason for the high interest rates is not primarily cost of capital.  Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%.<ref name=\"HighRates\">{{cite web|url = http://www.kiva.org/help/interestRateComparison|title = Kiva Help - Interest Rate Comparison|publisher = Kiva.org|accessdate = October 10, 2009}}</ref>  Rather, the main reason for the high cost of microfinance loans is the high [[transaction cost]] of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance#interestRatesAreHigh |title=About Microfinance |publisher=Kiva |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable, because the cost of making each loan cannot be reduced below a certain level while still allowing the lender to cover costs such as offices and staff salaries. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa credit risk for microfinance institutes is very high, because customers need years to improve their livelihood and  face many challenges during this time. Financial institutes often do not even have a system to check the person's identity. Additionally they are unable to design new products and enlarge their business to reduce the risk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moving forward |author1=Geoffrey Muzigiti |author2=Oliver Schmidt |publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation/ dandc.eu |date=January 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/financial-inclusion-poor-sub-saharan-africa-improving-thanks-formal-sector-banks-and}}</ref> The result is that the traditional approach to microfinance has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microfinance loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Offering loans at interest and fee rates of 37% mean that borrowers who do not manage to earn at least a 37% rate of return may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans.\n\n[[File:Example of Flat Rate Loan Contract Chambak, Cambodia.JPG|thumb|Example of a loan contract, using flat rate calculation, from rural Cambodia.

Some resorted to measures such as reducing their food intake or taking children out of school in order to repay microfinance debts that had not proven sufficiently profitable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn recent years, the microfinance industry has shifted its focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably. Microfinance analyst David Roodman contends that, in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Istazk|first1=Lennon|title=Alles over een Klein Bedrag Lenen.|url=https://kleinbedraglenen.nl/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Klein bedrag lenen|date=4 July 2014}}</ref> However, global average interest rates for microfinance loans are still well above 30%.\n\nThe answer to providing microfinance services at an affordable cost may lie in rethinking one of the fundamental assumptions underlying microfinance: that microfinance borrowers need extensive monitoring and interaction with loan officers in order to benefit from and repay their loans. The P2P microlending service [[Zidisha]] is based on this premise, facilitating direct interaction between individual lenders and borrowers via an internet community rather than physical offices. Zidisha has managed to bring the cost of microloans to below 10% for borrowers, including interest which is paid out to lenders. However, it remains to be seen whether such radical alternative models can reach the scale necessary to compete with traditional microfinance programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katic |first=Gordon |url=http://www.terry.ubc.ca/2013/02/20/terry-project-podcast-21-micro-finance-lending-a-hand-to-the-poor/ |title=Micro-finance, Lending a Hand to the Poor? |publisher=Terry.ubc.ca |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Use of loans===\nPractitioners and donors from the charitable side of microfinance frequently argue for restricting microcredit to loans for productive purposes\u2014such as to start or expand a [[microenterprise]].

Although it is generally agreed that microfinance practitioners should seek to balance these goals to some extent, there are a wide variety of strategies, ranging from the minimalist profit-orientation of [[BancoSol]] in [[Bolivia]] to the highly integrated not-for-profit orientation of [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]].

Evidence shows that they are less likely to default on their loans than men. Industry data from 2006 for 704 MFIs reaching 52 million borrowers includes MFIs using the [[solidarity lending]] methodology (99.3% female clients) and MFIs using individual lending (51% female clients). The delinquency rate for solidarity lending was 0.9% after 30 days (individual lending\u20143.1%), while 0.3% of loans were written off (individual lending\u20140.9%).<ref>{{cite web| last = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| title = MicroBanking Bulletin Issue #15, Autumn, 2007, pp. 46,49| publisher = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| date = 2007-08-01| url = http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| accessdate = 2010-01-15| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152122/http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| archivedate = 2010-01-05}}</ref>  Because operating margins become tighter the smaller the loans delivered, many MFIs consider the risk of lending to men to be too high. This focus on women is questioned sometimes, however a recent study of microentrepreneurs from Sri Lanka published by the [[World Bank]] found that the return on capital for male-owned businesses (half of the sample) averaged 11%, whereas the return for women-owned businesses was 0% or slightly negative.<ref>{{cite web| last = McKenzie| first = David| title = Comments Made at IPA/FAI Microfinance Conference Oct. 17 2008 | publisher = Philanthropy Action | date = 2008-10-17| url = http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/what_is_it_about_women/| accessdate = 2008-10-17}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance's emphasis on female-oriented lending is the subject of controversy, as it is claimed that microfinance improves the status of women through an alleviation of poverty. It is argued that by providing women with initial capital, they will be able to support themselves independent of men, in a manner which would encourage sustainable growth of enterprise and eventual self-sufficiency.  This claim has yet to be proven in any substantial form. Moreover, the attraction of women as a potential investment base is precisely because they are constrained by socio-cultural norms regarding such concepts of obedience, familial duty, household maintenance and passivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bruton, Chavez & Khavul|first1=G.D., H. & S.|title=Microlending in emerging economies:building a new line of inquiry from the ground up|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2011|volume=42|issue=5|pages=718\u2013739|doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.58}}</ref> The result of these norms is that while micro-lending may enable women to improve their daily subsistence to a more steady pace, they will not be able to engage in market-oriented business practice beyond a limited scope of low-skilled, low-earning, informal work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bee|first1=Beth|title=Gender, solidarity and the paradox of microfinance: Reflections from Bolivia|journal=Gender, Place & Culture|date=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=23\u201343|doi=10.1080/0966369X.2011.535298}}</ref> Part of this is a lack of permissivity in the society; part a reflection of the added burdens of household maintenance that women shoulder alone as a result of microfinancial empowerment; and part a lack of training and education surrounding gendered conceptions of economics. In particular, the shift in norms such that women continue to be responsible for all the domestic private sphere labour as well as undertaking public economic support for their families, independent of male aid increases rather than decreases burdens on already limited persons.\n[[Image:Microfinance in Malawi.jpg|thumb|Women of Malawi posing with their savings box]]\nIf there were to be an exchange of labour, or if women's income were supplemental rather than essential to household maintenance, there might be some truth to claims of establishing long-term businesses; however when so constrained it is impossible for women to do more than pay off a current loan only to take on another in a cyclic pattern which is beneficial to the financier but hardly to the borrower.  This gender essentializing crosses over from institutionalized lenders such as the Grameen Bank into interpersonal direct lending through charitable crowd-funding operations, such as Kiva. More recently, the popularity of non-profit global online lending has grown, suggesting that a redress of gender norms might be instituted through individual selection fomented by the processes of such programs, but the reality is as yet uncertain. Studies have noted that the likelihood of lending to women, individually or in groups, is 38% higher than rates of lending to men.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ly & Mason|first1=P. & G.|title=Individual preference over development projects:evidence from microlending on Kiva|journal=Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations|date=2012|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1036\u20131055|doi=10.1007/s11266-011-9255-8}}</ref>\n\nThis is also due to a general trend for interpersonal microfinance relations to be conducted on grounds of similarity and internal/external recognition: lenders want to see something familiar, something supportable in potential borrowers, so an emphasis on family, goals of education and health, and a commitment to community all achieve positive results from prospective financiers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Allison, Davis, Short & Webb|first1=T.H., B.C., J.C., & J.W.|title=Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues|journal=Entrepreneurship|date=2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53\u201373}}</ref> Unfortunately, these labels disproportionately align with women rather than men, particularly in the developing world. The result is that microfinance continues to rely on restrictive gender norms rather than seek to subvert them through economic redress in terms of foundation change: training, business management and financial education are all elements which might be included in parameters of female-aimed loans and until they are the fundamental reality of women as a disadvantaged section of societies in developing states will go untested.\n\n====Organizations supporting this work====\n* [[FINCA International|FINCA]] <ref name=\"4Ways\" />\n*[https://nwtf.org.ph/ NWTF]\n*[https://akhuwat.org.pk/ akhuwat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://alkhidmat.org/mawakhat/ Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://www.wholeplanetfoundation.org/ Whole Planet Foundation]\n*[[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiva.org/|title=Kiva - Loans that change lives|website=Kiva|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[https://microfinancecouncil.org/ MCPI]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://microfinancecouncil.org/|title=Microfinance Council of the Philippines - Link Against Poverty|website=Microfinance Council of the Philippines|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[[Women's World Banking|Women's World Banking]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womensworldbanking.org/|title=Women's World Banking {{!}} Women's Financial Inclusion|website=Women's World Banking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits and limitations===\nMicrofinancing produces many benefits for poverty stricken and low-income households. One of the benefits is that it is very accessible. Banks today simply won't extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don't engage in small size loans typically associated with microfinancing. Through microfinancing small loans are produced and accessible.  Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the microfinancing initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving microfinancing are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, people are more likely to open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs. Overall, the benefits outline that the microfinancing initiative is set out to improve the standard of living amongst impoverished communities (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThere are also many social and financial challenges for microfinance initiatives. For example, more articulate and better-off community members may cheat poorer or less-educated neighbours. This may occur intentionally or inadvertently through loosely run organizations. As a result, many microfinance initiatives require a large amount of social capital or trust in order to work effectively. The ability of poorer people to save may also fluctuate over time as unexpected costs may take priority which could result in them being able to save little or nothing some weeks. Rates of inflation may cause funds to lose their value, thus financially harming the saver and not benefiting the collector (Rutherford, 2009).\n\n==History of microfinance==\n\nOver the past centuries, practical visionaries, from the [[Franciscan]] friars who founded the community-oriented [[pawnbroker|pawnshops]] of the 15th century to the founders of the [[Europe]]an [[credit union]] movement in the 19th century (such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]]) and the founders of the [[microcredit]] movement in the 1970s (such as [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Al Whittaker]]), have tested practices and built institutions designed to bring the kinds of opportunities and risk-management tools that financial services can provide to the doorsteps of poor people.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book| last =Helms| first =Brigit| title =Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems| publisher =[[The World Bank]]| year =2006| location =[[Washington, D.C.]]| isbn =978-0-8213-6360-7}}</ref> While the success of the [[Grameen Bank]] (which now serves over 7 million poor Bangladeshi women) has inspired the world,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} it has proved difficult to replicate this success. In nations with lower population densities, meeting the operating costs of a retail branch by serving nearby customers has proven considerably more challenging. Hans Dieter Seibel, board member of the European Microfinance Platform, is in favour of the group model. This particular model (used by many Microfinance institutions) makes financial sense, he says, because it reduces transaction costs. Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds.<ref>[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075542/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml|date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe history of microfinancing can be traced back as far as the middle of the 1800s, when the theorist [[Lysander Spooner]] was writing about the benefits of small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting the people out of poverty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Independently of Spooner, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]] founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural [[Germany]].<ref>[http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810074631/http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf|date=August 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe modern use of the expression \"microfinancing\" has roots in the 1970s when [[Grameen Bank]] of [[Bangladesh]], founded by microfinance pioneer [[Muhammad Yunus]], was starting and shaping the modern industry of microfinancing.

They receive loans and [[grants]] from [[charities]]. They buy insurance from state-owned companies. They receive funds transfers through formal or informal [[remittance]] networks. It is not easy to distinguish microfinance from similar activities. It could be claimed that a government that orders state banks to open deposit accounts for poor consumers, or a moneylender that engages in [[usury]], or a charity that runs a [[Heifer International|heifer pool]] are engaged in microfinance. Ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them, as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions. In recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions, since different institutions serve different needs.\n\nSome principles that summarize a century and a half of development practice were encapsulated in 2004 by CGAP and endorsed by the [[Group of Eight]] leaders at the G8 Summit on June 10, 2004:<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n#Poor people need not just loans but also savings, [[insurance]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]] services.\n#Microfinance must be useful to poor households: helping them raise income, build up assets and/or cushion themselves against external shocks.\n#\"Microfinance can pay for itself.\"<ref>Helms (2006), p. xi</ref>  Subsidies from donors and government are scarce and uncertain and so, to reach large numbers of poor people, microfinance must pay for itself.\n#Microfinance means building permanent local institutions.\n#Microfinance also means integrating the financial needs of poor people into a country's mainstream financial system.\n#\"The job of government is to enable financial services, not to provide them.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>Helms (2006), p. xii</ref>\n#\"Donor funds should complement private [[Financial capital|capital]], not compete with it.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n#\"The key [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] is the shortage of strong institutions and managers.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />  Donors should focus on capacity building.\n#[[Interest rate ceiling]]s hurt poor people by preventing microfinance institutions from covering their costs, which chokes off the supply of credit.\n#Microfinance institutions should measure and disclose their performance\u2014both financially and socially.\n\nMicrofinance is considered a tool for socio-economic development, and can be clearly distinguished from charity.  Families who are destitute, or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan, should be recipients of charity. Others are best served by financial institutions.\n\n==Scale of microfinance operations==\n[[File:Small Enterprise Foundation - loan officer.jpg|thumb|Two women talk about financial matters.

A benchmark was established by an analysis of 'alternative financial institutions' in the developing world in 2004.<ref>Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg & Veena Jayadeva.  ''Financial institutions with a double-bottom line:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  CGAP Occasional Paper, July 2004.</ref>  The authors counted approximately 665 million client accounts at over 3,000 institutions that are serving people who are poorer than those served by the commercial banks. Of these accounts, 120 million were with institutions normally understood to practice microfinance. Reflecting the diverse historical roots of the movement, however, they also included postal [[savings bank]]s (318 million accounts), state agricultural and [[Community development bank|development bank]]s (172 million accounts), financial [[cooperatives]] and [[credit unions]] (35 million accounts) and specialized rural banks (19 million accounts).\n\nRegionally, the highest concentration of these accounts was in [[India]] (188 million accounts representing 18% of the total national population). The lowest concentrations were in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] (14 million accounts representing 3% of the total population) and [[Africa]] (27 million accounts representing 4% of the total population, with the highest rate of penetration in West Africa, and the highest growth rate in Eastern and Southern Africa <ref>{{cite web| last = MFW4A - Microfinance | title = MFW4A - Microfinance | date = 2010-11-05 | url = http://www.mfw4a.org/access-to-finance/microfinance.html}}</ref> ). Considering that most bank clients in the developed world need several active accounts to keep their affairs in order, these figures indicate that the task the microfinance movement has set for itself is still very far from finished.\n\nBy type of service, \"savings accounts in alternative finance institutions outnumber loans by about four to one.

They served low-income and marginalized [[minority group|minority communities]]. By 2007, there were 500 microfinance organizations operating in the US with 200 lending capital.<ref name=micro />\n\nThere were three key factors that triggered the growth in domestic microfinance:\n# Change in social welfare policies and focus on economic development and job creation at the macro level.\n# Encouragement of employment, including [[self-employment]], as a strategy for improving the lives of the poor.\n# The increase in the proportion of [[Latin American]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants who came from societies where microenterprises are prevalent.\nThese factors incentivized the public and private supports to have microlending activity in the United States.<ref name=micro />\n\n===Canada===\nMicrofinance in Canada took shape through the development of credit unions. These credit unions provided financial services to the Canadians who could not get access to traditional financial means. Two separate branches of credit unions developed in Canada to serve the financially marginalized segment of the population. [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] introduced the establishment of savings and credit services in late 1900 to the [[Quebec]]ois who did not have financial access. Approximately 30 years later [[Moses Coady|Father Moses Coady]] introduced credit unions to [[Nova Scotia]]. These were the models of the modern institutions still present in Canada today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Chantelle|author2=Christian Novak|title=Low Income Entrepreneurs and their Access to Financing in Canada, Especially in the Province of Quebec/City of Montreal|date=May 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to transfer specific microfinance innovations such as [[solidarity lending]] from developing countries to Canada have met with little success.<ref>See for example Cheryl Frankiewicz ''Calmeadow Metrofund:  a Canadian experiment in sustainable microfinance'', Calmeadow Foundation, 2001.</ref>\n\nSelected microfinance institutions in Canada are:\n*'''[[Rise Asset Development]]'''\nFounded by Sandra Rotman in 2009, Rise is a Rotman and CAMH initiative that provides small business loans, leases, and lines of credit to entrepreneurs with mental health and/or addiction challenges.\n*'''[[Alterna Savings]]'''\nFormed in 2005 through the merging of the Civil Service Savings and Loan Society and the Metro Credit Union, Alterna is a financial alternative to Canadians.

Momentum provides individuals and families who want to better their financial situation take control of finances, become computer literate, secure employment, borrow and repay loans for business, and purchase homes.\n*'''[[Vancity]]'''\nFounded in 1946, Vancity is now the largest English speaking credit union in Canada.\n\n'''Limitations'''\n\nComplications specific to Canada include the need for loans of a substantial size in comparison to the ones typically seen in many international microfinance initiatives. Microfinance is also limited by the rules and limitations surrounding money-lending. For example, Canada Revenue Agency limits the loans made in these sort of transactions to a maximum of $25,000. As a result, many people look to banks to provide these loans. Also, microfinance in Canada is driven by profit which, as a result, fails to advance the social development of community members. Within marginalized or impoverished Canadian communities, banks may not be readily accessible to deposit or take out funds. These banks which would have charged little or no interest on small amounts of cash are replaced by lending companies. Here, these companies may charge extremely large interest rates to marginalized community members thus increasing the cycle of poverty and profiting off of another's loss (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nIn Canada, microfinancing competes with pay-day loans institutions which take advantage of marginalized and low-income individuals by charging extremely high, predatory interest rates. Communities with low social capital often don't have the networks to implement and support microfinance initiatives, leading  to the proliferation of pay day loan institutions. Pay day loan companies are unlike traditional microfinance in that they don't encourage collectivism and social capital building in low income communities, however exist solely for profit.\n\n==Microfinance in Pakistan==\nIn Pakistan \nAkhuwat is the world\u2019s largest Islamic micro-finance organization. Since 2001, Akhuwat has been working for poverty alleviation by empowering socially and economically marginalized segments of the society through its various poverty alleviation projects.\n\nAkhuwat aims to alleviate poverty by creating a bond of solidarity between the affluent and the marginalized. Our goal is to develop and sustain a social system based on mutual support. Akhuwat not only helps and support the poor to become self-reliant but combined with their own hard work enable them to escape the clutches of poverty.\n\n'''Philosophy of Akhuwat'''\n\nAkhuwat derives its name from \u2018mawakhaat\u2019 or brotherhood, the earliest example of which was seen in the community formed by the Ansars, citizens of Medina and the Muhajireen, who had migrated to Medina to escape religious persecution. Inspired by the spirit which induced the Medinites to share half of their wealth with the migrants, Akhuwat seeks to invoke this very concept of brotherhood through its operations. For Akhuwat, the metaphor of brotherhood entails the creation of a system based on mutual support in the society.\n\n'''Akhuwat\u2019s Values'''\n\nAkhuwat is running on the following principles:\n\nInterest-free Loans \u2013 The loan provided will be interest free since providing loans with interest is business and poverty cannot be alleviated and eradicated by doing business with the deprived.\nUse of Religious Places \u2013 Akhuwat wants to climb up the ladder of social and economic development through making Mosques, churches and religious places, the foundation. This is because in Islamic history Mosques used to be the seat of governance. In the time of Muhammad, mosques were used for worship, training and providing services. With this, comes the Transparency, Good Governance, participation and accountability.\nVolunteerism \u2013 To think beyond the confines of oneself and to think about others. Akhuwat\u2019s operations and activities rely upon the passion, energy, zeal and enthusiasm of its volunteers.\nTransforming Borrowers into Donors \u2013 Akhuwat strives to empower its borrowers, so they are in a position to be givers one day.\nNon-Discrimination on Caste, Color, Creed, Political Affiliation & Faith \u2013 Since Akhuwat strongly believes in solidarity and brotherhood. Therefore, it gives a message to cut down all the discriminatory and differential barriers in the society such as caste, color creed, political affiliation and religion.\n\n'''Core Principles'''\n\n'''INTEREST-FREE LOANS'''\n\nAkhuwat provides interest free loans to the economically poor so that they may acquire a sustainable livelihood. The organization sees interest as a barrier to widespread proliferation of capital, and a violation of all moral and ethical codes. In keeping with the principles of equity and social justice, burdening the poor with exorbitant interest rates is also viewed as undermining the overarching goal of poverty alleviation.\n\n\n==Microfinance on the Indian subcontinent==\n\nLoans to poor people by banks have many limitations including lack of security and high operating costs. As a result, microfinance was developed as an alternative to provide loans to poor people with the goal of creating financial inclusion and equality.\n\n'''[[Ela Bhatt]]''' had initiated women's own [[Self Employed Women's Association#Economic tools|SEWA Cooperative Bank]] in 1974 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, perhaps one of the first modern day microfinance institution of its kind. '''[[Muhammad Yunus]]''', a Nobel Prize winner, had introduced the concept of Micro-credit in Bangladesh in the form of the \"Grameen Bank\". The [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] (NABARD) looked at several models for offering financial services to the unbanked, especially women, and decided to experiment with a very different model, now popularly known as Self-help Groups (SHGs). In this approach, a small group of women (and men) are able to form their own little mini bank, self-governed and managed, and create links with banks [[Self-help group (finance)|SHGs]] (Self-help groups), [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and banks. SHGs are often formed and nurtured by NGOs and only after accomplishing a certain level of maturity in terms of their internal thrift and credit operations, they are able to save, and also seek credit from the banks. There is often an involvement of an NGO, or a government agency during initial training and even after the SHG-Bank linkage. The SHG-Bank linkage programme, which has been in place since 1992 in India, has savings accounts with 7.9 million SHGs, with 4.6 million SHGs having outstanding loans, with approximately $2 billion in saving with banks, and $8.9 Billion is outstanding loans, making it one of the largest microfinance program of its kind in the world (March 2016). It involves commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and cooperative banks in its operations.\n\nIn 2013, Grameen Capital India was able to loan $144 million to microfinance groups. In addition to Grameen Bank, [[Equitas Small Finance Bank|Equitas]] has been another microfinance organization in Tamil Nadu. The South and Western states are the ones attracting the greatest number of microfinance loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21569447-industry-starting-revive-road-redemption|title=Road to redemption|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance is defined as, financial services such as savings accounts, insurance funds and credit provided to poor and low income clients so as to help them increase their income, thereby improving their standard of living.\n\nIn this context the main features of microfinance are:\n\n* Loan given without security\n* Loans to those people who live below the poverty line\n* Members of SHGs may benefit from micro finance\n* Maximum limit of loan under micro finance Rs.25,000/-\n* Terms and conditions offered to poor people are decided by NGOs\n* Microfinance is different from Microcredit- under the latter, small loans are given to the borrower but under microfinance alongside many other financial services including savings accounts and insurance. Therefore, microfinance has a wider concept than microcredit.\n\nIn June 2014, CRISIL released its latest report on the Indian Microfinance Sector titled \"India's 25 Leading MFI's\".<ref>[http://indiamicrofinance.com/microfinance-companies-in-india-2014-2015-2.html Top Microfinance Institutions in India for 2014] CRISIL Report, June 2014.</ref> This list is the most comprehensive and up to date overview of the microfinance sector in India and the different microfinance institutions operating in the sub-continent.\n\nMany loan officers in India create an emotional connection with the borrowers before the loan reaches maturity by mentioning details about borrowers\u2019 personal life and family and also demonstrating affection in different ways as a strategy to generate pressure during recovery.<ref>Kar, S.

Established in 1993, the Microfinance Network provided support to members that helped steer many industry leaders to sustainability, and profitability in many of their largest markets. Today as the sector enters a new period of transition, with the rise of digital [[financial technology]] that increasingly competes with traditional microfinance institutions, the Microfinance Network provides a space to discuss opportunities and challenges that arise from emerging technological innovations in inclusive finance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://microfinancenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Future-of-Financial-Inclusion_MFN_London2017_Summary5825.pdf|title=The Future of Financial Inclusion: A Leadership Challenge|last=Velarde|display-authors=etal|first=Raul|date=April 2017|website=microfinancenetwork.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320044143/http://microfinancenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Future-of-Financial-Inclusion_MFN_London2017_Summary5825.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=|access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref> The Microfinance Network convenes once a year. Members include Al Majmoua, BRAC, BancoSol, Gentera, Kamurj, LAPO, and SOGESOL.\n\n=== Partnership for Responsible Financial Inclusion ===\nThe [https://responsiblefinancialinclusion.org/ Partnership for Responsible Financial], previously known as the Microfinance CEO Working Group, is a collaborative effort of leading international organizations and their CEOs active in the microfinance and inclusive finance space, including direct microfinance practitioners, and microfinance funders. It consists of 10 members, including Accion, Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance, BRAC, CARE USA, FINCA Impact Finance, Grameen Foundation, Opportunity International, Pro Mujer, Vision Fund International and Women's World Banking.  Harnessing the power of the CEOs and their senior managers, the PRFI advocates for responsible financial services and seeks catalytic opportunities to accelerate financial access to the unserved. As part of this focus, PRFI is responsible for setting up the Smart Campaign, in response to negative microfinance practices that indicated the mistreatment of clients in certain markets. The network is made up of the CEO working group, that meet quarterly and several subcommittee working groups dedicated to communications, social performance, digital financial services, and legal and human resources issues.....\n\n=== European Microfinance Network ===\nThe [https://www.european-microfinance.org/ European Microfinance Network] was established in response to many legal and political obstacles affecting the microfinance sector in Europe. The Network is involved in advocacy on a wide range of issues related to microfinance, micro-enterprises, social and financial exclusion, self-employment and employment creation. Its main activity is the organisation of its annual conference, which has taken place each year since 2004. The EMN has a wide network of over 100 members.\n\n=== Africa Microfinance Network (AFMIN) ===\nThe [http://www.afminetwork.org/ Africa Microfinance Network (AFMIN)] is an association of microfinance networks in Africa resulting from an initiative led by African microfinance practitioners to create and/or strengthen country-level microfinance networks for the purpose of establishing shared performance standards, institutional capacity and policy change. \nAFMIN was formally launched in November 2000 and has established its secretariat in Abidjan (Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), where AFMIN is legally recognized as an international Non-Governmental Organisation pursuant to Ivorian laws. Because of the political unrest in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, AFMIN temporarily relocated its office to Cotonou in Benin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afminetwork.org/about.html|title=AFMIN Website - About}}</ref>\n\n==Inclusive financial systems==\nThe [[microcredit]] movement that began in the 1970s has emerged and morphed into a 'financial systems' approach for creating universal financial inclusion.  While Grameen model of delivering small credit achieved a great deal, especially in urban and near-urban areas and with [[entrepreneurial]] families, its progress in delivering financial services in less densely populated rural areas was slow; creating the need for many and multiple models to emerge across the globe. The terms have evolved from Microcredit, to Microfinance, and now Financial Inclusion. Specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs) continue to expand their services, collaborating and competing with banks, credit unions, mobile money, and other informal and formal member owned institutions.\n\nThe new financial systems approach pragmatically acknowledges the richness of centuries of microfinance history and the immense diversity of institutions serving poor people in developing and developed economies today.  It is also rooted in an increasing awareness of diversity of the financial service needs of the world's poorest people, and the diverse settings in which they live and work. It also acknowledges that quality and rage of financial services are also important for the banking system to achieve fuller and deeper financial inclusion, for all. Central banks and mainstream banks are now more intimately engaging in the financial inclusion agenda than ever before, though it is a long road, with over 35-40% of worlds adults remaining outside formal banking system, and many more remaining 'under-banked'. Advent of mobile phone based money management and digital finance is changing the scenario fast; though 'social-distance' between economically poor/ social marginalized and the banking system remain large, unfortunately.\n\n;Informal financial service providers: These include moneylenders, [[pawnbrokers]], savings collectors, [[money-guards]], ROSCAs, [[ASCAs]] and input supply shops.  These continue their services because they know each other well and live in the same community, they understand each other's financial circumstances and can offer very flexible, convenient and fast services.  These services can also be costly and the choice of financial products limited and very short-term.  Informal services that involve savings are also risky; many people lose their money.\n\n;Member-owned organizations: These include [[Self-help group (finance)|self-help group]]s, [[Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs)]], [[Credit union]]s, [[CVECA]]s and a variety of other members owned and governed informal or formal financial institutions.  Informal groups, like their more traditional cousins, are generally small and local, which means they have access to good knowledge about each other's financial circumstances and can offer convenience and flexibility.  Since they are managed by poor people, their costs of operation are low.  Often, they do not need regulation and supervision, unless they grow in scale and formalize themselves by coming together to form II or III tier federations. If not prepared well, they can be 'captured' by a few influential leaders, and run the risk of members losing their savings. Experience suggests though that these informal but highly disciplined groups are very sustainable, and continue to exist even after 20\u201325 years. Formalization, as a Cooperative of Credit Union, can help create links with the banking system for more sophisticated financial products and additional capital for loans; but requires strong leadership and systems. These models are highly popular in many rural regions of countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and a platform for creating deeper financial inclusion.\n\n;NGOs: The [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]] counted 3,316 of these MFIs and [[NGO]]s lending to about 133 million clients by the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222154645/http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-22 |title=''State of the Microcredit Summit Campaign Report 2007'', Microcredit Summit Campaign, Washington, 2007. |publisher=Microcreditsummit.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2011-03-25 }}</ref>  Led by [[Grameen Bank]] and [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]], [[Prodem]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Opportunity International]], and [[FINCA International]], headquartered in Washington, DC, these NGOs have spread around the developing world in the past three decades; others, like the [[Gamelan Council]], address larger regions.  They have proven very innovative, pioneering banking techniques like [[solidarity lending]], [[village banking]] and [[mobile banking]] that have overcome barriers to serving poor populations.  However, with boards that don't necessarily represent either their capital or their customers, their governance structures can be fragile, and they can become overly dependent on external donors.\n\n;Formal financial institutions: In addition to commercial banks, these include state banks, agricultural development banks, savings banks, rural banks and non-bank financial institutions.  They are regulated and supervised, offer a wider range of financial services, and control a branch network that can extend across the country and internationally.  However, they have proved reluctant to adopt social missions, and due to their high costs of operation, often can't deliver services to poor or remote populations. The increasing use of [[alternative data]] in credit scoring, such as [[trade credit]] is increasing commercial banks' interest in microfinance.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al. ''Information Sharing and SMME Financing in South Africa'', [[Political and Economic Research Council]] (PERC), p58.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001222753/http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf |date=2008-10-01 }}</ref>\n\nWith appropriate regulation and supervision, each of these institutional types can bring leverage to solving the microfinance problem.  For example, efforts are being made to link self-help groups to commercial banks, to network member-owned organizations together to achieve [[economies of scale]] and scope, and to support efforts by commercial banks to 'down-scale' by integrating mobile banking and e-payment technologies into their extensive branch networks.\n\nBrigit Helms in her book 'Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems', distinguishes between four general categories of microfinance providers, and argues for a pro-active strategy of engagement with all of them to help them achieve the goals of the microfinance movement.<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, pp. 35-57.</ref>\n\n==Microcredit and the Web==\n\nDue to the unbalanced emphasis on credit at the expense of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, [[peer-to-peer lending|peer-to-peer]] platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world. New platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs are emerging on the Web (''[[list of microfinance sponsors|peer-to-peer sponsors]]''), for example [[MYC4]], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], myELEN, [[Opportunity International]] and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another Web-based microlender [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]] uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe volume channeled through [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]'s peer-to-peer platform is about $100 million as of November 2009 (Kiva facilitates approximately $5M in loans each month).

Criticism focuses on the impact on poverty, the level of interest rates, high profits, overindebtedness and suicides. Other criticism include the role of foreign donors and working conditions in companies affiliated to microfinance institutions, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\n===Impact===\n{{Details|Impact of microcredit}}\nThe impact of microcredit is a subject of much controversy. Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.\n\nCritics say that microcredit has not increased incomes, but has driven poor households into a debt trap, in some cases even leading to suicide. They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education. Moreover, as the access to micro-loans is widespread, borrowers tend to acquire several loans from different companies, making it nearly impossible to pay the debt back.<ref>Biswas, Soutik (December 16, 2010). \"India's micro-finance suicide epidemic\". [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11997571], BBC News. Retrieved July 15, 2015.</ref> As a result of such tragic events, microfinance institutions in India have agreed on setting an interest rate ceiling of 15 percent.<ref>\nSundaresan, S. (2008). Microfinance emerging trends and challenges (pp. 15-16). Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.\n978-1847209207</ref> This is important because microfinance loan recipients have a higher level of security  in repaying the loans and a lower level of risk in failing to repay them.\n\nUnintended consequences of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|doi = 10.18356/10695889-en|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103\u2013117|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}</ref>\n\n=== Competition and market saturation ===\nMicrocredit has also received criticism for inducing market saturation and fueling problematically competitive, rather than collaborative business communities<ref name=\"Crises\">{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9rin|first=Isabelle|last2=Labie|first2=Marc|last3=Servet|first3=Jean-Michel|date=2015|title=The Crises of Microcredit|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/ucpbkecon/9781783603756.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"Challenges\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.findevgateway.org/library/microfinance-challenges-empowerment-or-disempowerment-poor|title=Microfinance Challenges: Empowerment or Disempowerment of the Poor?|date=2014-04-11|website=FinDev Gateway - CGAP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>. The influx of supply generated by the creation of new microcredit-fueled-businesses can be difficult for small economies to absorb. The owners of micro-enterprises within such communities often have limited skill sets and resources available. This can cause a \u201ccopycat\u201d phenomenon among small business due to the limited variation in products and services offerings.<ref name=\"Crises\" /> The high number of individuals selling similar products and services can cause new entrepreneurs to be subject to cutthroat competition over a demand that has not expanded proportionally with the supply.<ref name=\"Challenges\" />\n\n===Mission drift in microfinance===\n\nMission drift refers to the phenomena through which the MFIs or the micro finance institutions increasingly try to cater to customers who are better off than their original customers, primarily the poor families. Roy Mersland and R. \u00d8ystein Str\u00f8m in their research on mission drift suggest that this selection bias can come not only through an increase in the average loan size, which allows for financially stronger individuals to get the loans, but also through the MFI's particular lending methodology, main market of operation, or even the gender bias as further mission drift measures.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mersland | first1 = Roy | last2 = Str\u00f8m | first2 = R. \u00d8ystein | title = Microfinance mission drift? | journal = [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 28\u201336 | doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.05.006 | date = January 2010 | ref = harv | hdl = 11250/2428249 | url = https://oda.hioa.no/en/item/asset/dspace:1298/523226post.pdf }}</ref> And as it may follow, this selective funding would lead to lower risks and lower costs for the firm.\n\nHowever, economists Beatriz Armend\u00e1riz and Ariane Szafarz suggests that  this phenomenon is not driven by cost minimization alone. She suggests that it happens because of the interplay between the company's mission, the cost differential between poor and unbanked wealthier clients and region specific characteristics pertaining the heterogeneity of their clientele.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | first1 = Beatriz | last2 = Szafarz | first2 =Ariane | contribution = On mission drift in microfinance institutions | editor-last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | editor-first1 = Beatriz | editor-last2 = Labie | editor-first2 = Marc | title = The handbook of microfinance | pages = 341\u2013366 | publisher = [[World Scientific]] | location = Singapore Hackensack, New Jersey | year = 2011 | isbn = 9789814295659 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> But in either way, this problem of selective funding leads to an ethical tradeoff where on one hand there is an economic reason for the company to restrict its loans to only the individuals who qualify the standards, and on the other hand there is an ethical responsibility to help the poor people get out of poverty through the provision of capital.\n\n===Role of foreign donors===\nThe role of donors has also been questioned.  CGAP recently commented that \"a large proportion of the money they spend is not effective, either because it gets hung up in unsuccessful and often complicated funding mechanisms (for example, a government apex facility), or it goes to partners that are not held accountable for performance. In some cases, poorly conceived programs have retarded the development of inclusive financial systems by distorting markets and displacing domestic commercial initiatives with cheap or free money.\"<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, p. 97.</ref>\n\n===Working conditions in enterprises affiliated to MFIs===\nThere has also been criticism of microlenders for not taking more responsibility for the working conditions of poor households, particularly when borrowers become quasi-wage labourers, selling crafts or agricultural produce through an organization controlled by the MFI. The desire of MFIs to help their borrower diversify and increase their incomes has sparked this type of relationship in several countries, most notably [[Bangladesh]], where hundreds of thousands of borrowers effectively work as wage labourers for the marketing subsidiaries of [[Grameen Bank]] or [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]]. Critics maintain that there are few if any rules or standards in these cases governing working hours, holidays, working conditions, safety or child labour, and few inspection regimes to correct abuses.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Farooque |date=June 24, 2007 |title=The metamorphosis of the micro-credit debtor |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=New Age |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410121959/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |archive-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>  Some of these concerns have been taken up by [[trade union|union]]s and [[socially responsible investing|socially responsible investment]] advocates.\n\n===Abuse===\nIn Nigeria cases of fraud have been reported.

''[[Financial institutions]] with a [[Double bottom line|double-bottom line]]:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  [[Partnership|CGAP]] Occasional Paper, July 2004, pp. 2-3.</ref>\n\nMicrofinance initially had a limited definition - the provision of microloans to poor entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to [[credit]]. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were: (1) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and (2) group-based models, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger [[social movement|movement]] whose object is \"a world in which as everyone, especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and [[Electronic funds transfer|fund transfers]].\"<ref name=\"christen-rosenberg-jayadeva\"/>\n\nProponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help poor people out of [[poverty]], including participants in the [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]]. For many, microfinance is a way to promote economic development, employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses; for others it is a way for the poor to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks. Critics often point to some of the ills of micro-credit that can create indebtedness. Due to diverse contexts in which microfinance operates, and the broad range of microfinance services, it is neither possible nor wise to have a generalized view of impacts microfinance may create. Many studies have tried to assess its impacts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feigenberg|first=Benjamin|author2=Erica M.

This is often the case when people need the services money can provide but do not have dispensable funds required for those services, forcing them to revert to other means of acquiring them.\nIn their book ''The Poor and Their Money'', Stuart Rutherford and Sukhwinder Arora cite several types of needs:\n* ''Lifecycle Needs'':  such as weddings, funerals, childbirth, education, home building, widowhood and old age.\n* ''Personal Emergencies'':  such as sickness, injury, unemployment, theft, harassment or death.\n* ''Disasters'':  such as wildfires, floods, cyclones and man-made events like war or bulldozing of dwellings.\n* ''Investment Opportunities'':  expanding a business, buying land or equipment, improving housing, securing a job, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rutherford | first1 = Stuart | last2 = Arora | first2 = Sukhwinder | title = The poor and their money: micro finance from a twenty-first century consumer's perspective | page = 4 | publisher = Practical Action | location = Warwickshire, UK | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781853396885 }}</ref>\nPeople find creative and often collaborative ways to meet these needs, primarily through creating and exchanging different forms of non-cash value. Common substitutes for cash vary from country to country but typically include livestock, grains, jewelry and precious metals.\nAs Marguerite S. Robinson describes in his book 'The Micro finance Revolution - Sustainable Finance for the Poor', the 1980s demonstrated that \"micro finance could provide large-scale outreach profitably,\" and in the 1990s, \"micro finance began to develop as an industry\" (2001, p.&nbsp;54).\nIn the 2000s, the micro finance industry's objective is to satisfy the unmet [[demand]] on a much larger scale, and to play a role in reducing poverty. While much progress has been made in developing a viable, commercial micro finance sector in the last few decades, several issues remain that need to be addressed before the industry will be able to satisfy massive worldwide demand.\nThe obstacles or challenges in building a sound commercial micro finance industry include:\n* Inappropriate donor [[subsidies]]\n* Poor regulation and supervision of deposit-taking micro finance institutions (MFIs)\n* Few MFIs that meet the needs for savings, remittances or insurance\n* Limited management capacity in MFIs\n* Institutional inefficiencies\n* Need for more dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural micro finance methodologies\n* Members lack of collateral to secure a loan\n\nMicrofinance is the proper tool to reduce income inequality, allowing citizens from lower socio-economical classes to participate in the economy. Moreover, its involvement has shown to lead to a downward trend in income inequality (Hermes, 2014).<ref>Hermes, N. (2014). Does microfinance affect income inequality? Applied Economics, 46(9), 1021-1034. doi:10.1080/00036846.2013.864039</ref>\n\n===Ways in which poor people manage their money===\n\n[[File:Saving up.jpg|thumb|Saving up]]\nRutherford argues that the basic problem that poor people face as money managers is to gather a 'usefully large' amount of money. Building a new home may involve saving and protecting diverse building materials for years until enough are available to proceed with construction. Children's schooling may be funded by buying chickens and raising them for sale as needed for expenses, uniforms, bribes, etc. Because all the value is accumulated before it is needed, this money management strategy is referred to as 'saving up'.(Hermes, 2014).<ref>Rutherford, Stuart. The poor and their money. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nOften, people don't have enough money when they face a need, so they borrow. A poor family might borrow from relatives to buy land, from a moneylender to buy rice, or from a microfinance institution to buy a sewing machine. Since these loans must be repaid by saving after the cost is incurred, Rutherford calls this 'saving down'. Rutherford's point is that microcredit is addressing only half the problem, and arguably the less important half: poor people borrow to help them save and accumulate assets. Microcredit institutions should fund their loans through savings accounts that help poor people manage their myriad risks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Saving down.jpg|left|thumb|Saving down]]\nMost needs are met through a mix of saving and credit. A benchmark impact assessment of [[Grameen Bank]] and two other large microfinance institutions in Bangladesh found that for every $1 they were lending to clients to finance rural non-farm [[micro-enterprise]], about $2.50 came from other sources, mostly their clients' savings.<ref>{{cite book | last = Khandker | first = Shahidur R. | title = Fighting poverty with microcredit: experience in Bangladesh | page = 78 | publisher = The University Press Ltd. | location = Dhaka, Bangladesh | year = 1999 | isbn = 9789840514687 }}</ref>  This parallels the experience in the West, in which family businesses are funded mostly from savings, especially during start-up.\n\nRecent studies have also shown that informal methods of saving are unsafe. For example, a study by Wright and Mutesasira in [[Uganda]] concluded that \"those with no option but to save in the informal sector are almost bound to lose some money\u2014probably around one quarter of what they save there.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Graham A.

The new paradigm places more attention on the efforts of poor people to reduce their many vulnerabilities by keeping more of what they earn and building up their assets. While they need loans, they may find it as useful to borrow for consumption as for microenterprise. A safe, flexible place to save money and withdraw it when needed is also essential for managing household and family risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Examples===\nThe microfinance project of \"saving up\" is exemplified in the slums of the south-eastern city of Vijayawada, India. This microfinance project functions as an unofficial banking system where Jyothi, a \"deposit collector\", collects money from slum dwellers, mostly women, in order for them to accumulate savings. Jyothi does her rounds throughout the city, collecting Rs5 a day from people in the slums for 220 days, however not always 220 days in a row since these women do not always have the funds available to put them into savings. They ultimately end up with Rs1000 at the end of the process. However, there are some issues with this microfinance saving program. One of the issues is that while saving, clients are actually losing part of their savings. Jyothi takes interest from each client\u2014about 20 out of every 220 payments, or Rs100 out of 1,100 or 8%. When these slum dwellers find someone they trust, they are willing to pay up to 30% to someone to safely collect and keep their savings. There is also the risk of entrusting their savings to unlicensed, informal, peripatetic collectors. However, the slum dwellers are willing to accept this risk because they are unable to save at home, and unable to use the remote and unfriendly banks in their country. This microfinance project also has many benefits, such as empowering women and giving parents the ability to save money for their children's education. This specific microfinance project is an example of the benefits and limitations of the \"saving up\" project (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThe microfinance project of \"saving through\" is shown in Nairobi, Kenya which includes a Rotating Savings and Credit Associations or ROSCAs initiative. This is a small scale example, however Rutherford (2009) describes a woman he met in Nairobi and studied her ROSCA. Everyday 15 women would save 100 shillings so there would be a lump sum of 1,500 shillings and everyday 1 of the 15 women would receive that lump sum. This would continue for 15 days and another woman within this group would receive the lump sum. At the end of the 15 days a new cycle would start. This ROSCA initiative is different from the \"saving up\" example above because there are no interest rates affiliated with the ROSCA, additionally everyone receives back what they put forth. This initiative requires trust and social capital networks in order to work, so often these ROSCAs include people who know each other and have reciprocity. The ROSCA allows for marginalized groups to receive a lump sum at one time in order to pay or save for specific needs they have.\n\n==Microfinance debates and challenges==\n\nThere are several key debates at the boundaries of microfinance.\n\n===Loan Pricing===\n[[File:A business in South Sudan benefiting from microfinance (6189731244).jpg|thumb|This shop in [[South Sudan]] was opened using money borrowed from the Finance Sudan Limited (FSL) Program. This program was established in 2006 as one of the only microfinance lenders in the country.]]\n\nBefore determining loan price one should take these two costs; Administrative costs by the bank(MFI) and transaction cost by the client/customer. Customers, on the other hand, may have expenses for travelling to the bank branch, acquiring official documents for the loan application, and loss of time when dealing with the MFI (\u201copportunity costs\u201d). Hence, from a customer's point of view the cost of a loan is not only the interest and fees she/he has to pay, but also all other transaction costs that she/he has to cover.\n\nOne of the principal challenges of microfinance is providing small loans at an affordable cost. The global average interest and fee rate is estimated at 37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/14microfinance.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | title=Banks Making Big Profits From Tiny Loans | date=2010-04-13}}</ref>  The reason for the high interest rates is not primarily cost of capital.  Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%.<ref name=\"HighRates\">{{cite web|url = http://www.kiva.org/help/interestRateComparison|title = Kiva Help - Interest Rate Comparison|publisher = Kiva.org|accessdate = October 10, 2009}}</ref>  Rather, the main reason for the high cost of microfinance loans is the high [[transaction cost]] of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance#interestRatesAreHigh |title=About Microfinance |publisher=Kiva |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable, because the cost of making each loan cannot be reduced below a certain level while still allowing the lender to cover costs such as offices and staff salaries. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa credit risk for microfinance institutes is very high, because customers need years to improve their livelihood and  face many challenges during this time. Financial institutes often do not even have a system to check the person's identity. Additionally they are unable to design new products and enlarge their business to reduce the risk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moving forward |author1=Geoffrey Muzigiti |author2=Oliver Schmidt |publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation/ dandc.eu |date=January 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/financial-inclusion-poor-sub-saharan-africa-improving-thanks-formal-sector-banks-and}}</ref> The result is that the traditional approach to microfinance has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microfinance loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Offering loans at interest and fee rates of 37% mean that borrowers who do not manage to earn at least a 37% rate of return may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans.\n\n[[File:Example of Flat Rate Loan Contract Chambak, Cambodia.JPG|thumb|Example of a loan contract, using flat rate calculation, from rural Cambodia. Loan is for 400,000 riels at 4% flat (16,000 riels) interest per month.]]\nAccording to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans. Some resorted to measures such as reducing their food intake or taking children out of school in order to repay microfinance debts that had not proven sufficiently profitable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn recent years, the microfinance industry has shifted its focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably. Microfinance analyst David Roodman contends that, in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Istazk|first1=Lennon|title=Alles over een Klein Bedrag Lenen.|url=https://kleinbedraglenen.nl/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Klein bedrag lenen|date=4 July 2014}}</ref> However, global average interest rates for microfinance loans are still well above 30%.\n\nThe answer to providing microfinance services at an affordable cost may lie in rethinking one of the fundamental assumptions underlying microfinance: that microfinance borrowers need extensive monitoring and interaction with loan officers in order to benefit from and repay their loans. The P2P microlending service [[Zidisha]] is based on this premise, facilitating direct interaction between individual lenders and borrowers via an internet community rather than physical offices. Zidisha has managed to bring the cost of microloans to below 10% for borrowers, including interest which is paid out to lenders. However, it remains to be seen whether such radical alternative models can reach the scale necessary to compete with traditional microfinance programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katic |first=Gordon |url=http://www.terry.ubc.ca/2013/02/20/terry-project-podcast-21-micro-finance-lending-a-hand-to-the-poor/ |title=Micro-finance, Lending a Hand to the Poor? |publisher=Terry.ubc.ca |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Use of loans===\nPractitioners and donors from the charitable side of microfinance frequently argue for restricting microcredit to loans for productive purposes\u2014such as to start or expand a [[microenterprise]]. Those from the private-sector side respond that, because money is [[Fungibility|fungible]], such a restriction is impossible to enforce, and that in any case it should not be up to rich people to determine how poor people use their money{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.\n\n===Reach versus depth of impact===\n[[File:Rwandan farm cooperative goats.jpg|thumb|These goats are being raised by Rwandan women as part of a farm cooperative funded by microfinance.]]\nThere has been a long-standing debate over the sharpness of the trade-off between 'outreach' (the ability of a microfinance institution to reach poorer and more remote people) and its '[[sustainability]]' (its ability to cover its operating costs\u2014and possibly also its costs of serving new clients\u2014from its operating revenues). Although it is generally agreed that microfinance practitioners should seek to balance these goals to some extent, there are a wide variety of strategies, ranging from the minimalist profit-orientation of [[BancoSol]] in [[Bolivia]] to the highly integrated not-for-profit orientation of [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]]. This is true not only for individual institutions, but also for governments engaged in developing national microfinance systems.

Evidence shows that they are less likely to default on their loans than men. Industry data from 2006 for 704 MFIs reaching 52 million borrowers includes MFIs using the [[solidarity lending]] methodology (99.3% female clients) and MFIs using individual lending (51% female clients). The delinquency rate for solidarity lending was 0.9% after 30 days (individual lending\u20143.1%), while 0.3% of loans were written off (individual lending\u20140.9%).<ref>{{cite web| last = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| title = MicroBanking Bulletin Issue #15, Autumn, 2007, pp. 46,49| publisher = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| date = 2007-08-01| url = http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| accessdate = 2010-01-15| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152122/http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| archivedate = 2010-01-05}}</ref>  Because operating margins become tighter the smaller the loans delivered, many MFIs consider the risk of lending to men to be too high. This focus on women is questioned sometimes, however a recent study of microentrepreneurs from Sri Lanka published by the [[World Bank]] found that the return on capital for male-owned businesses (half of the sample) averaged 11%, whereas the return for women-owned businesses was 0% or slightly negative.<ref>{{cite web| last = McKenzie| first = David| title = Comments Made at IPA/FAI Microfinance Conference Oct. 17 2008 | publisher = Philanthropy Action | date = 2008-10-17| url = http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/what_is_it_about_women/| accessdate = 2008-10-17}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance's emphasis on female-oriented lending is the subject of controversy, as it is claimed that microfinance improves the status of women through an alleviation of poverty. It is argued that by providing women with initial capital, they will be able to support themselves independent of men, in a manner which would encourage sustainable growth of enterprise and eventual self-sufficiency.  This claim has yet to be proven in any substantial form. Moreover, the attraction of women as a potential investment base is precisely because they are constrained by socio-cultural norms regarding such concepts of obedience, familial duty, household maintenance and passivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bruton, Chavez & Khavul|first1=G.D., H. & S.|title=Microlending in emerging economies:building a new line of inquiry from the ground up|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2011|volume=42|issue=5|pages=718\u2013739|doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.58}}</ref> The result of these norms is that while micro-lending may enable women to improve their daily subsistence to a more steady pace, they will not be able to engage in market-oriented business practice beyond a limited scope of low-skilled, low-earning, informal work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bee|first1=Beth|title=Gender, solidarity and the paradox of microfinance: Reflections from Bolivia|journal=Gender, Place & Culture|date=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=23\u201343|doi=10.1080/0966369X.2011.535298}}</ref> Part of this is a lack of permissivity in the society; part a reflection of the added burdens of household maintenance that women shoulder alone as a result of microfinancial empowerment; and part a lack of training and education surrounding gendered conceptions of economics. In particular, the shift in norms such that women continue to be responsible for all the domestic private sphere labour as well as undertaking public economic support for their families, independent of male aid increases rather than decreases burdens on already limited persons.\n[[Image:Microfinance in Malawi.jpg|thumb|Women of Malawi posing with their savings box]]\nIf there were to be an exchange of labour, or if women's income were supplemental rather than essential to household maintenance, there might be some truth to claims of establishing long-term businesses; however when so constrained it is impossible for women to do more than pay off a current loan only to take on another in a cyclic pattern which is beneficial to the financier but hardly to the borrower.  This gender essentializing crosses over from institutionalized lenders such as the Grameen Bank into interpersonal direct lending through charitable crowd-funding operations, such as Kiva. More recently, the popularity of non-profit global online lending has grown, suggesting that a redress of gender norms might be instituted through individual selection fomented by the processes of such programs, but the reality is as yet uncertain. Studies have noted that the likelihood of lending to women, individually or in groups, is 38% higher than rates of lending to men.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ly & Mason|first1=P. & G.|title=Individual preference over development projects:evidence from microlending on Kiva|journal=Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations|date=2012|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1036\u20131055|doi=10.1007/s11266-011-9255-8}}</ref>\n\nThis is also due to a general trend for interpersonal microfinance relations to be conducted on grounds of similarity and internal/external recognition: lenders want to see something familiar, something supportable in potential borrowers, so an emphasis on family, goals of education and health, and a commitment to community all achieve positive results from prospective financiers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Allison, Davis, Short & Webb|first1=T.H., B.C., J.C., & J.W.|title=Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues|journal=Entrepreneurship|date=2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53\u201373}}</ref> Unfortunately, these labels disproportionately align with women rather than men, particularly in the developing world. The result is that microfinance continues to rely on restrictive gender norms rather than seek to subvert them through economic redress in terms of foundation change: training, business management and financial education are all elements which might be included in parameters of female-aimed loans and until they are the fundamental reality of women as a disadvantaged section of societies in developing states will go untested.\n\n====Organizations supporting this work====\n* [[FINCA International|FINCA]] <ref name=\"4Ways\" />\n*[https://nwtf.org.ph/ NWTF]\n*[https://akhuwat.org.pk/ akhuwat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://alkhidmat.org/mawakhat/ Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://www.wholeplanetfoundation.org/ Whole Planet Foundation]\n*[[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiva.org/|title=Kiva - Loans that change lives|website=Kiva|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[https://microfinancecouncil.org/ MCPI]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://microfinancecouncil.org/|title=Microfinance Council of the Philippines - Link Against Poverty|website=Microfinance Council of the Philippines|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[[Women's World Banking|Women's World Banking]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womensworldbanking.org/|title=Women's World Banking {{!}} Women's Financial Inclusion|website=Women's World Banking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits and limitations===\nMicrofinancing produces many benefits for poverty stricken and low-income households. One of the benefits is that it is very accessible. Banks today simply won't extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don't engage in small size loans typically associated with microfinancing. Through microfinancing small loans are produced and accessible.  Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the microfinancing initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving microfinancing are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, people are more likely to open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs. Overall, the benefits outline that the microfinancing initiative is set out to improve the standard of living amongst impoverished communities (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThere are also many social and financial challenges for microfinance initiatives. For example, more articulate and better-off community members may cheat poorer or less-educated neighbours. This may occur intentionally or inadvertently through loosely run organizations. As a result, many microfinance initiatives require a large amount of social capital or trust in order to work effectively. The ability of poorer people to save may also fluctuate over time as unexpected costs may take priority which could result in them being able to save little or nothing some weeks. Rates of inflation may cause funds to lose their value, thus financially harming the saver and not benefiting the collector (Rutherford, 2009).\n\n==History of microfinance==\n\nOver the past centuries, practical visionaries, from the [[Franciscan]] friars who founded the community-oriented [[pawnbroker|pawnshops]] of the 15th century to the founders of the [[Europe]]an [[credit union]] movement in the 19th century (such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]]) and the founders of the [[microcredit]] movement in the 1970s (such as [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Al Whittaker]]), have tested practices and built institutions designed to bring the kinds of opportunities and risk-management tools that financial services can provide to the doorsteps of poor people.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book| last =Helms| first =Brigit| title =Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems| publisher =[[The World Bank]]| year =2006| location =[[Washington, D.C.]]| isbn =978-0-8213-6360-7}}</ref> While the success of the [[Grameen Bank]] (which now serves over 7 million poor Bangladeshi women) has inspired the world,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} it has proved difficult to replicate this success. In nations with lower population densities, meeting the operating costs of a retail branch by serving nearby customers has proven considerably more challenging. Hans Dieter Seibel, board member of the European Microfinance Platform, is in favour of the group model. This particular model (used by many Microfinance institutions) makes financial sense, he says, because it reduces transaction costs. Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds.<ref>[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075542/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml|date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe history of microfinancing can be traced back as far as the middle of the 1800s, when the theorist [[Lysander Spooner]] was writing about the benefits of small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting the people out of poverty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Independently of Spooner, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]] founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural [[Germany]].<ref>[http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810074631/http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf|date=August 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe modern use of the expression \"microfinancing\" has roots in the 1970s when [[Grameen Bank]] of [[Bangladesh]], founded by microfinance pioneer [[Muhammad Yunus]], was starting and shaping the modern industry of microfinancing.

They receive loans and [[grants]] from [[charities]]. They buy insurance from state-owned companies. They receive funds transfers through formal or informal [[remittance]] networks. It is not easy to distinguish microfinance from similar activities. It could be claimed that a government that orders state banks to open deposit accounts for poor consumers, or a moneylender that engages in [[usury]], or a charity that runs a [[Heifer International|heifer pool]] are engaged in microfinance. Ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them, as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions. In recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions, since different institutions serve different needs.\n\nSome principles that summarize a century and a half of development practice were encapsulated in 2004 by CGAP and endorsed by the [[Group of Eight]] leaders at the G8 Summit on June 10, 2004:<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n#Poor people need not just loans but also savings, [[insurance]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]] services.\n#Microfinance must be useful to poor households: helping them raise income, build up assets and/or cushion themselves against external shocks.\n#\"Microfinance can pay for itself.\"<ref>Helms (2006), p. xi</ref>  Subsidies from donors and government are scarce and uncertain and so, to reach large numbers of poor people, microfinance must pay for itself.\n#Microfinance means building permanent local institutions.\n#Microfinance also means integrating the financial needs of poor people into a country's mainstream financial system.\n#\"The job of government is to enable financial services, not to provide them.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>Helms (2006), p. xii</ref>\n#\"Donor funds should complement private [[Financial capital|capital]], not compete with it.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n#\"The key [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] is the shortage of strong institutions and managers.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />  Donors should focus on capacity building.\n#[[Interest rate ceiling]]s hurt poor people by preventing microfinance institutions from covering their costs, which chokes off the supply of credit.\n#Microfinance institutions should measure and disclose their performance\u2014both financially and socially.\n\nMicrofinance is considered a tool for socio-economic development, and can be clearly distinguished from charity.  Families who are destitute, or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan, should be recipients of charity. Others are best served by financial institutions.\n\n==Scale of microfinance operations==\n[[File:Small Enterprise Foundation - loan officer.jpg|thumb|Two women talk about financial matters. The woman on the right is a loan officer for the [[Small Enterprise Foundation]] (SEF).  The conversation shown is taking place in [[Tzaneen]], [[South Africa]] in February 2010.]]\n\nNo systematic effort to map the distribution of microfinance has yet been undertaken. A benchmark was established by an analysis of 'alternative financial institutions' in the developing world in 2004.<ref>Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg & Veena Jayadeva.  ''Financial institutions with a double-bottom line:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  CGAP Occasional Paper, July 2004.</ref>  The authors counted approximately 665 million client accounts at over 3,000 institutions that are serving people who are poorer than those served by the commercial banks. Of these accounts, 120 million were with institutions normally understood to practice microfinance. Reflecting the diverse historical roots of the movement, however, they also included postal [[savings bank]]s (318 million accounts), state agricultural and [[Community development bank|development bank]]s (172 million accounts), financial [[cooperatives]] and [[credit unions]] (35 million accounts) and specialized rural banks (19 million accounts).\n\nRegionally, the highest concentration of these accounts was in [[India]] (188 million accounts representing 18% of the total national population). The lowest concentrations were in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] (14 million accounts representing 3% of the total population) and [[Africa]] (27 million accounts representing 4% of the total population, with the highest rate of penetration in West Africa, and the highest growth rate in Eastern and Southern Africa <ref>{{cite web| last = MFW4A - Microfinance | title = MFW4A - Microfinance | date = 2010-11-05 | url = http://www.mfw4a.org/access-to-finance/microfinance.html}}</ref> ). Considering that most bank clients in the developed world need several active accounts to keep their affairs in order, these figures indicate that the task the microfinance movement has set for itself is still very far from finished.\n\nBy type of service, \"savings accounts in alternative finance institutions outnumber loans by about four to one.  This is a worldwide pattern that does not vary much by region.\"<ref>Christen, Rosenberg & Jayadeva.

They served low-income and marginalized [[minority group|minority communities]]. By 2007, there were 500 microfinance organizations operating in the US with 200 lending capital.<ref name=micro />\n\nThere were three key factors that triggered the growth in domestic microfinance:\n# Change in social welfare policies and focus on economic development and job creation at the macro level.\n# Encouragement of employment, including [[self-employment]], as a strategy for improving the lives of the poor.\n# The increase in the proportion of [[Latin American]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants who came from societies where microenterprises are prevalent.\nThese factors incentivized the public and private supports to have microlending activity in the United States.<ref name=micro />\n\n===Canada===\nMicrofinance in Canada took shape through the development of credit unions. These credit unions provided financial services to the Canadians who could not get access to traditional financial means. Two separate branches of credit unions developed in Canada to serve the financially marginalized segment of the population. [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] introduced the establishment of savings and credit services in late 1900 to the [[Quebec]]ois who did not have financial access. Approximately 30 years later [[Moses Coady|Father Moses Coady]] introduced credit unions to [[Nova Scotia]]. These were the models of the modern institutions still present in Canada today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Chantelle|author2=Christian Novak|title=Low Income Entrepreneurs and their Access to Financing in Canada, Especially in the Province of Quebec/City of Montreal|date=May 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to transfer specific microfinance innovations such as [[solidarity lending]] from developing countries to Canada have met with little success.<ref>See for example Cheryl Frankiewicz ''Calmeadow Metrofund:  a Canadian experiment in sustainable microfinance'', Calmeadow Foundation, 2001.</ref>\n\nSelected microfinance institutions in Canada are:\n*'''[[Rise Asset Development]]'''\nFounded by Sandra Rotman in 2009, Rise is a Rotman and CAMH initiative that provides small business loans, leases, and lines of credit to entrepreneurs with mental health and/or addiction challenges.\n*'''[[Alterna Savings]]'''\nFormed in 2005 through the merging of the Civil Service Savings and Loan Society and the Metro Credit Union, Alterna is a financial alternative to Canadians.

Momentum provides individuals and families who want to better their financial situation take control of finances, become computer literate, secure employment, borrow and repay loans for business, and purchase homes.\n*'''[[Vancity]]'''\nFounded in 1946, Vancity is now the largest English speaking credit union in Canada.\n\n'''Limitations'''\n\nComplications specific to Canada include the need for loans of a substantial size in comparison to the ones typically seen in many international microfinance initiatives. Microfinance is also limited by the rules and limitations surrounding money-lending. For example, Canada Revenue Agency limits the loans made in these sort of transactions to a maximum of $25,000. As a result, many people look to banks to provide these loans. Also, microfinance in Canada is driven by profit which, as a result, fails to advance the social development of community members. Within marginalized or impoverished Canadian communities, banks may not be readily accessible to deposit or take out funds. These banks which would have charged little or no interest on small amounts of cash are replaced by lending companies. Here, these companies may charge extremely large interest rates to marginalized community members thus increasing the cycle of poverty and profiting off of another's loss (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nIn Canada, microfinancing competes with pay-day loans institutions which take advantage of marginalized and low-income individuals by charging extremely high, predatory interest rates. Communities with low social capital often don't have the networks to implement and support microfinance initiatives, leading  to the proliferation of pay day loan institutions. Pay day loan companies are unlike traditional microfinance in that they don't encourage collectivism and social capital building in low income communities, however exist solely for profit.\n\n==Microfinance in Pakistan==\nIn Pakistan \nAkhuwat is the world\u2019s largest Islamic micro-finance organization. Since 2001, Akhuwat has been working for poverty alleviation by empowering socially and economically marginalized segments of the society through its various poverty alleviation projects.\n\nAkhuwat aims to alleviate poverty by creating a bond of solidarity between the affluent and the marginalized. Our goal is to develop and sustain a social system based on mutual support. Akhuwat not only helps and support the poor to become self-reliant but combined with their own hard work enable them to escape the clutches of poverty.\n\n'''Philosophy of Akhuwat'''\n\nAkhuwat derives its name from \u2018mawakhaat\u2019 or brotherhood, the earliest example of which was seen in the community formed by the Ansars, citizens of Medina and the Muhajireen, who had migrated to Medina to escape religious persecution. Inspired by the spirit which induced the Medinites to share half of their wealth with the migrants, Akhuwat seeks to invoke this very concept of brotherhood through its operations. For Akhuwat, the metaphor of brotherhood entails the creation of a system based on mutual support in the society.\n\n'''Akhuwat\u2019s Values'''\n\nAkhuwat is running on the following principles:\n\nInterest-free Loans \u2013 The loan provided will be interest free since providing loans with interest is business and poverty cannot be alleviated and eradicated by doing business with the deprived.\nUse of Religious Places \u2013 Akhuwat wants to climb up the ladder of social and economic development through making Mosques, churches and religious places, the foundation. This is because in Islamic history Mosques used to be the seat of governance. In the time of Muhammad, mosques were used for worship, training and providing services. With this, comes the Transparency, Good Governance, participation and accountability.\nVolunteerism \u2013 To think beyond the confines of oneself and to think about others. Akhuwat\u2019s operations and activities rely upon the passion, energy, zeal and enthusiasm of its volunteers.\nTransforming Borrowers into Donors \u2013 Akhuwat strives to empower its borrowers, so they are in a position to be givers one day.\nNon-Discrimination on Caste, Color, Creed, Political Affiliation & Faith \u2013 Since Akhuwat strongly believes in solidarity and brotherhood. Therefore, it gives a message to cut down all the discriminatory and differential barriers in the society such as caste, color creed, political affiliation and religion.\n\n'''Core Principles'''\n\n'''INTEREST-FREE LOANS'''\n\nAkhuwat provides interest free loans to the economically poor so that they may acquire a sustainable livelihood. The organization sees interest as a barrier to widespread proliferation of capital, and a violation of all moral and ethical codes. In keeping with the principles of equity and social justice, burdening the poor with exorbitant interest rates is also viewed as undermining the overarching goal of poverty alleviation.\n\n\n==Microfinance on the Indian subcontinent==\n\nLoans to poor people by banks have many limitations including lack of security and high operating costs. As a result, microfinance was developed as an alternative to provide loans to poor people with the goal of creating financial inclusion and equality.\n\n'''[[Ela Bhatt]]''' had initiated women's own [[Self Employed Women's Association#Economic tools|SEWA Cooperative Bank]] in 1974 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, perhaps one of the first modern day microfinance institution of its kind. '''[[Muhammad Yunus]]''', a Nobel Prize winner, had introduced the concept of Micro-credit in Bangladesh in the form of the \"Grameen Bank\". The [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] (NABARD) looked at several models for offering financial services to the unbanked, especially women, and decided to experiment with a very different model, now popularly known as Self-help Groups (SHGs). In this approach, a small group of women (and men) are able to form their own little mini bank, self-governed and managed, and create links with banks [[Self-help group (finance)|SHGs]] (Self-help groups), [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and banks. SHGs are often formed and nurtured by NGOs and only after accomplishing a certain level of maturity in terms of their internal thrift and credit operations, they are able to save, and also seek credit from the banks. There is often an involvement of an NGO, or a government agency during initial training and even after the SHG-Bank linkage. The SHG-Bank linkage programme, which has been in place since 1992 in India, has savings accounts with 7.9 million SHGs, with 4.6 million SHGs having outstanding loans, with approximately $2 billion in saving with banks, and $8.9 Billion is outstanding loans, making it one of the largest microfinance program of its kind in the world (March 2016). It involves commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and cooperative banks in its operations.\n\nIn 2013, Grameen Capital India was able to loan $144 million to microfinance groups. In addition to Grameen Bank, [[Equitas Small Finance Bank|Equitas]] has been another microfinance organization in Tamil Nadu. The South and Western states are the ones attracting the greatest number of microfinance loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21569447-industry-starting-revive-road-redemption|title=Road to redemption|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance is defined as, financial services such as savings accounts, insurance funds and credit provided to poor and low income clients so as to help them increase their income, thereby improving their standard of living.\n\nIn this context the main features of microfinance are:\n\n* Loan given without security\n* Loans to those people who live below the poverty line\n* Members of SHGs may benefit from micro finance\n* Maximum limit of loan under micro finance Rs.25,000/-\n* Terms and conditions offered to poor people are decided by NGOs\n* Microfinance is different from Microcredit- under the latter, small loans are given to the borrower but under microfinance alongside many other financial services including savings accounts and insurance.

It consists of 10 members, including Accion, Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance, BRAC, CARE USA, FINCA Impact Finance, Grameen Foundation, Opportunity International, Pro Mujer, Vision Fund International and Women's World Banking.  Harnessing the power of the CEOs and their senior managers, the PRFI advocates for responsible financial services and seeks catalytic opportunities to accelerate financial access to the unserved.

While Grameen model of delivering small credit achieved a great deal, especially in urban and near-urban areas and with [[entrepreneurial]] families, its progress in delivering financial services in less densely populated rural areas was slow; creating the need for many and multiple models to emerge across the globe. The terms have evolved from Microcredit, to Microfinance, and now Financial Inclusion. Specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs) continue to expand their services, collaborating and competing with banks, credit unions, mobile money, and other informal and formal member owned institutions.\n\nThe new financial systems approach pragmatically acknowledges the richness of centuries of microfinance history and the immense diversity of institutions serving poor people in developing and developed economies today.  It is also rooted in an increasing awareness of diversity of the financial service needs of the world's poorest people, and the diverse settings in which they live and work. It also acknowledges that quality and rage of financial services are also important for the banking system to achieve fuller and deeper financial inclusion, for all. Central banks and mainstream banks are now more intimately engaging in the financial inclusion agenda than ever before, though it is a long road, with over 35-40% of worlds adults remaining outside formal banking system, and many more remaining 'under-banked'. Advent of mobile phone based money management and digital finance is changing the scenario fast; though 'social-distance' between economically poor/ social marginalized and the banking system remain large, unfortunately.\n\n;Informal financial service providers: These include moneylenders, [[pawnbrokers]], savings collectors, [[money-guards]], ROSCAs, [[ASCAs]] and input supply shops.  These continue their services because they know each other well and live in the same community, they understand each other's financial circumstances and can offer very flexible, convenient and fast services.  These services can also be costly and the choice of financial products limited and very short-term.  Informal services that involve savings are also risky; many people lose their money.\n\n;Member-owned organizations: These include [[Self-help group (finance)|self-help group]]s, [[Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs)]], [[Credit union]]s, [[CVECA]]s and a variety of other members owned and governed informal or formal financial institutions.  Informal groups, like their more traditional cousins, are generally small and local, which means they have access to good knowledge about each other's financial circumstances and can offer convenience and flexibility.  Since they are managed by poor people, their costs of operation are low.  Often, they do not need regulation and supervision, unless they grow in scale and formalize themselves by coming together to form II or III tier federations. If not prepared well, they can be 'captured' by a few influential leaders, and run the risk of members losing their savings. Experience suggests though that these informal but highly disciplined groups are very sustainable, and continue to exist even after 20\u201325 years. Formalization, as a Cooperative of Credit Union, can help create links with the banking system for more sophisticated financial products and additional capital for loans; but requires strong leadership and systems. These models are highly popular in many rural regions of countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and a platform for creating deeper financial inclusion.\n\n;NGOs: The [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]] counted 3,316 of these MFIs and [[NGO]]s lending to about 133 million clients by the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222154645/http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-22 |title=''State of the Microcredit Summit Campaign Report 2007'', Microcredit Summit Campaign, Washington, 2007. |publisher=Microcreditsummit.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2011-03-25 }}</ref>  Led by [[Grameen Bank]] and [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]], [[Prodem]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Opportunity International]], and [[FINCA International]], headquartered in Washington, DC, these NGOs have spread around the developing world in the past three decades; others, like the [[Gamelan Council]], address larger regions.  They have proven very innovative, pioneering banking techniques like [[solidarity lending]], [[village banking]] and [[mobile banking]] that have overcome barriers to serving poor populations.  However, with boards that don't necessarily represent either their capital or their customers, their governance structures can be fragile, and they can become overly dependent on external donors.\n\n;Formal financial institutions: In addition to commercial banks, these include state banks, agricultural development banks, savings banks, rural banks and non-bank financial institutions.  They are regulated and supervised, offer a wider range of financial services, and control a branch network that can extend across the country and internationally.  However, they have proved reluctant to adopt social missions, and due to their high costs of operation, often can't deliver services to poor or remote populations. The increasing use of [[alternative data]] in credit scoring, such as [[trade credit]] is increasing commercial banks' interest in microfinance.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al.

For example, efforts are being made to link self-help groups to commercial banks, to network member-owned organizations together to achieve [[economies of scale]] and scope, and to support efforts by commercial banks to 'down-scale' by integrating mobile banking and e-payment technologies into their extensive branch networks.\n\nBrigit Helms in her book 'Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems', distinguishes between four general categories of microfinance providers, and argues for a pro-active strategy of engagement with all of them to help them achieve the goals of the microfinance movement.<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, pp. 35-57.</ref>\n\n==Microcredit and the Web==\n\nDue to the unbalanced emphasis on credit at the expense of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, [[peer-to-peer lending|peer-to-peer]] platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world. New platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs are emerging on the Web (''[[list of microfinance sponsors|peer-to-peer sponsors]]''), for example [[MYC4]], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], myELEN, [[Opportunity International]] and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another Web-based microlender [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]] uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe volume channeled through [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]'s peer-to-peer platform is about $100 million as of November 2009 (Kiva facilitates approximately $5M in loans each month).

Criticism focuses on the impact on poverty, the level of interest rates, high profits, overindebtedness and suicides. Other criticism include the role of foreign donors and working conditions in companies affiliated to microfinance institutions, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\n===Impact===\n{{Details|Impact of microcredit}}\nThe impact of microcredit is a subject of much controversy. Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.\n\nCritics say that microcredit has not increased incomes, but has driven poor households into a debt trap, in some cases even leading to suicide. They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education. Moreover, as the access to micro-loans is widespread, borrowers tend to acquire several loans from different companies, making it nearly impossible to pay the debt back.<ref>Biswas, Soutik (December 16, 2010). \"India's micro-finance suicide epidemic\". [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11997571], BBC News. Retrieved July 15, 2015.</ref> As a result of such tragic events, microfinance institutions in India have agreed on setting an interest rate ceiling of 15 percent.<ref>\nSundaresan, S. (2008). Microfinance emerging trends and challenges (pp. 15-16). Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.\n978-1847209207</ref> This is important because microfinance loan recipients have a higher level of security  in repaying the loans and a lower level of risk in failing to repay them.\n\nUnintended consequences of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|doi = 10.18356/10695889-en|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103\u2013117|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}</ref>\n\n=== Competition and market saturation ===\nMicrocredit has also received criticism for inducing market saturation and fueling problematically competitive, rather than collaborative business communities<ref name=\"Crises\">{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9rin|first=Isabelle|last2=Labie|first2=Marc|last3=Servet|first3=Jean-Michel|date=2015|title=The Crises of Microcredit|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/ucpbkecon/9781783603756.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"Challenges\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.findevgateway.org/library/microfinance-challenges-empowerment-or-disempowerment-poor|title=Microfinance Challenges: Empowerment or Disempowerment of the Poor?|date=2014-04-11|website=FinDev Gateway - CGAP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>. The influx of supply generated by the creation of new microcredit-fueled-businesses can be difficult for small economies to absorb. The owners of micro-enterprises within such communities often have limited skill sets and resources available. This can cause a \u201ccopycat\u201d phenomenon among small business due to the limited variation in products and services offerings.<ref name=\"Crises\" /> The high number of individuals selling similar products and services can cause new entrepreneurs to be subject to cutthroat competition over a demand that has not expanded proportionally with the supply.<ref name=\"Challenges\" />\n\n===Mission drift in microfinance===\n\nMission drift refers to the phenomena through which the MFIs or the micro finance institutions increasingly try to cater to customers who are better off than their original customers, primarily the poor families. Roy Mersland and R. \u00d8ystein Str\u00f8m in their research on mission drift suggest that this selection bias can come not only through an increase in the average loan size, which allows for financially stronger individuals to get the loans, but also through the MFI's particular lending methodology, main market of operation, or even the gender bias as further mission drift measures.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mersland | first1 = Roy | last2 = Str\u00f8m | first2 = R. \u00d8ystein | title = Microfinance mission drift? | journal = [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 28\u201336 | doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.05.006 | date = January 2010 | ref = harv | hdl = 11250/2428249 | url = https://oda.hioa.no/en/item/asset/dspace:1298/523226post.pdf }}</ref> And as it may follow, this selective funding would lead to lower risks and lower costs for the firm.\n\nHowever, economists Beatriz Armend\u00e1riz and Ariane Szafarz suggests that  this phenomenon is not driven by cost minimization alone. She suggests that it happens because of the interplay between the company's mission, the cost differential between poor and unbanked wealthier clients and region specific characteristics pertaining the heterogeneity of their clientele.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | first1 = Beatriz | last2 = Szafarz | first2 =Ariane | contribution = On mission drift in microfinance institutions | editor-last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | editor-first1 = Beatriz | editor-last2 = Labie | editor-first2 = Marc | title = The handbook of microfinance | pages = 341\u2013366 | publisher = [[World Scientific]] | location = Singapore Hackensack, New Jersey | year = 2011 | isbn = 9789814295659 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> But in either way, this problem of selective funding leads to an ethical tradeoff where on one hand there is an economic reason for the company to restrict its loans to only the individuals who qualify the standards, and on the other hand there is an ethical responsibility to help the poor people get out of poverty through the provision of capital.\n\n===Role of foreign donors===\nThe role of donors has also been questioned.  CGAP recently commented that \"a large proportion of the money they spend is not effective, either because it gets hung up in unsuccessful and often complicated funding mechanisms (for example, a government apex facility), or it goes to partners that are not held accountable for performance. In some cases, poorly conceived programs have retarded the development of inclusive financial systems by distorting markets and displacing domestic commercial initiatives with cheap or free money.\"<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, p. 97.</ref>\n\n===Working conditions in enterprises affiliated to MFIs===\nThere has also been criticism of microlenders for not taking more responsibility for the working conditions of poor households, particularly when borrowers become quasi-wage labourers, selling crafts or agricultural produce through an organization controlled by the MFI. The desire of MFIs to help their borrower diversify and increase their incomes has sparked this type of relationship in several countries, most notably [[Bangladesh]], where hundreds of thousands of borrowers effectively work as wage labourers for the marketing subsidiaries of [[Grameen Bank]] or [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]]. Critics maintain that there are few if any rules or standards in these cases governing working hours, holidays, working conditions, safety or child labour, and few inspection regimes to correct abuses.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Farooque |date=June 24, 2007 |title=The metamorphosis of the micro-credit debtor |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=New Age |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410121959/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |archive-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>  Some of these concerns have been taken up by [[trade union|union]]s and [[socially responsible investing|socially responsible investment]] advocates.\n\n===Abuse===\nIn Nigeria cases of fraud have been reported.

It is designed to support entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. Many recipients are illiterate, and therefore unable to complete paperwork required to get conventional loans. As of 2009 an estimated 74 million people held microloans that totaled US$38 billion. [[Grameen Bank]] reports that repayment success rates are between 95 and 98 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grameenfoundation.org/what-we-do/microfinance-basics|title=What We Do - Grameen Foundation - Connecting the World's Poor to Their Potential|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMicrocredit is part of [[microfinance]], which provides a wider range of financial services, especially savings accounts, to the poor. Modern microcredit is generally considered to have originated with the Grameen Bank founded in [[Bangladesh]] in 1983.<ref name=\"Bateman 2010\"/> Many traditional banks subsequently introduced microcredit despite initial misgivings.

The Grameen Bank, which is generally considered the first modern microcredit institution, was founded in 1983 by [[Muhammad Yunus]].<ref name=\"Bateman 2010\"/> Yunus began the project in a small town called Jobra, using his own money to deliver small loans at low-interest rates to the rural poor.

By the 1980s, however the \"financial systems approach,\" influenced by [[neoliberalism]] and propagated by the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]], became the dominant ideology among microcredit organizations. The neoliberal model of microcredit can also be referred to as the institutionist model, which promotes applying market solutions as a viable way to address social problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bisen|first=Arjun|last2=Dalton|first2=Bronwen|last3=Wilson|first3=Rachel|date=November 2012|title=The Social Construction of the Microfinance Industry: a comparison of donor and recipient perspectives|url=|journal=Cosmopolitan Civil Societies: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> The commercialization of microcredit officially began in 1984 with the formation of Unit Desa (BRI-UD) within the [[Bank Rakyat Indonesia]]. Unit Desa offered \u2018kupedes\u2019 microloans based on market interest rates.\n\nYunus has sharply criticized the shift in microcredit organizations from the Grameen Bank model as a non-profit bank to for-profit institutions. \"I never dreamed that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks. . . There are always people eager to take advantage of the vulnerable.  But credit programs that seek to profit from the suffering of the poor should not be described as \u201cmicrocredit,\u201d and investors who own such programs should not be allowed to benefit from the trust and respect that microcredit banks have rightly earned.\"<ref>Muhammad Yunus, \u201cSacrificing Microcredit for Megaprofits\u201d New York Times (15 January 2011) A.23.</ref>\n\nMany microcredit organizations now function as independent banks. This has led to their charging higher interest rates on loans and placing more emphasis on savings programs.<ref name=\"Bateman 2010\"/> Notably, Unit Desa has charged in excess of 20 percent on small business loans.<ref name=\"gdrc.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/icm/country/unit-desa.html|title=BRI-Unit Desa, Indonesia|publisher=}}</ref> The application of [[neoliberal economics]] to microcredit has generated much debate among scholars and development practitioners, with some claiming that microcredit bank directors, such as Muhammad Yunus, apply the practices of loan sharks for their personal enrichment.<ref name=\"Drake 2002\"/> Indeed, the academic debate foreshadowed a Wall-street style scandal involving the Mexican microcredit organization [[Compartamos Banco|Compartamos]].<ref name=\"Bateman 2010\"/>\n\nEven so, the numbers indicate that ethical microlending and investor profit can go hand-in-hand. In the 1990s a rural finance minister in Indonesia showed how Unit Desa could lower its rates by about 8% while still bringing attractive returns to investors.<ref name=\"gdrc.org\"/>\n\n===Group lending===\n\nThough lending to groups has long been a key part of microcredit,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} microcredit initially began with the principle of lending to individuals.<ref name=\"Drake 2002\"/>  Despite the use of solidarity circles in 1970s Jobra, [[Grameen Bank]] and other early microcredit institutions initially focused on individual lending.<ref name=\"Armendariz 2005\">{{cite book|last=Armendariz|first=Beatriz|title=The Economics of Microfinance|year=2005|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass}}</ref>  (A solidarity circle is a group of borrowers that provide mutual encouragement, information, and assistance in times of need, though loans remain the responsibility of individuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleweaver.com/projects/MicroCredit/meetings/solidarity_circle/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106185156/http://www.peopleweaver.com/projects/MicroCredit/meetings/solidarity_circle/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 }} </ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Minilening uitleg|title=Wat is een minilening ?|url=http://www.goedkopeminilening.nl/wat-is-een-minilening/|accessdate=16 December 2016|work=Minilening|language=nl-NL}}</ref>)\nIndeed, [[Muhammad Yunus]] propagated the notion that every person has the potential to become an entrepreneur. Yunus saw poverty eradication as being in the hands of the individual. Because of this, he promoted private ownership, and consequently, neoliberalism.The use of group-lending was motivated by [[economics of scale]], as the costs associated with monitoring loans and enforcing repayment are significantly lower when credit is distributed to groups rather than individuals.<ref name=\"Armendariz 2005\"/>  Many times the loan to one participant in group-lending depends upon the successful repayment from another member, thus transferring repayment responsibility off of microcredit institutions to loan recipients.<ref name=\"Armendariz 2005\"/>\n\n===Lending to women===\nLending to women has become an important principle in microcredit, with banks and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s such as BancoSol, [[Women's World Banking|WWB]], and [[Pro Mujer]] catering to women exclusively.<ref name=\"Armendariz 2005\"/> Pro Mujer also implemented a new strategy to combine microcredits with health-care services, since the health of their clients is crucial to the success of microcredits.<ref>Microfinance - Healthy Clients http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/pro-mujer-why-microfinance-institutions-should-offer-healthcare-services-too</ref> Though Grameen Bank initially tried to lend to both men and women at equal rates, women presently make up ninety-five percent of the bank\u2019s clients.

SHGs comprise twenty or fewer members, of whom the majority are women from the poorest [[caste]]s and tribes. Members save small amounts of money, as little as a few rupees a month in a group fund. Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities. Banks typically lend up to four rupees for every rupee in the group fund. In Asia borrowers generally pay interest rates that range from 30% to 70% without commission and fees.<ref>Nimal A.

Most nonprofit microlenders include services like financial literacy training and business plan consultations, which contribute to the expense of providing such loans but also, those groups say, to the success of their borrowers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/business/microcredit-for-americans.html|title=Microcredit for Americans|first=Shaila|last=Dewan|date=|website=nytimes.com}}</ref> One such organization in the [[United States of America]], the [[Accion U.S. Network]] is a nonprofit microfinance organization headquartered in New York, NY. It is the largest and only nationwide nonprofit microfinance network in the U.S.. The Accion U.S. Network is part of Accion International, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization operating globally, with the mission of giving people the financial tools they need to create or grow healthy businesses. The domestic Accion programs started in Brooklyn, NY, and grew from there to become the first nationwide network microlender.<ref>[[Accion U.S. Network]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}} U.S. microcredit programs have helped many poor but ambitious borrowers to improve their lot.

Among these, multiple Internet-based organizations have developed platforms that facilitate a modified form of [[peer-to-peer lending]] where a loan is not made in the form of a single, direct loan, but as the aggregation of a number of smaller loans\u2014often at a negligible interest rate.\n\nExamples of platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs via Internet are [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another WWW-based microlender, [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228000309/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia |date=2010-02-28 }}</ref> [[Vittana]] allows peer-to-peer lending for student loans in developing countries.<ref>Rao.

Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US, UK and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.<ref>Nitin Bhatt, Gary Painter, and Shui-Yan Tang, 1999. \u201cCan Microcredit Work in the United States?\u201d, Harvard Business Review, November-December 1999 Issue.

It has often generated [[self-employment]], but it has not necessarily increased incomes after interest payments. In some cases it has driven borrowers into debt traps. There is no evidence that microcredit has empowered women. In short, microcredit has achieved much less than what its proponents said it would achieve, but its negative impacts have not been as drastic as some critics have argued. Microcredit is just one factor influencing the success of a small businesses, whose success is influenced to a much larger extent by how much an economy or a particular market grows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-01/ifpa-mdl012115.php|title=Microcredit doesn't live up to promise of transforming lives of the poor, 6 studies show|author=|date=|website=EurekAlert!}}</ref>\n\n[[Unintended consequences]] of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs.

The result is that the traditional approach to microcredit has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microcredit loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Borrowers who do not manage to earn a rate of return at least equal to the interest rate may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans. According to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans.<ref>http://centerforfinancialinclusionblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/111108_cfi_over-indebtedness-in-ghana_jessica-schicks_en_final.pdf</ref> In recent years, microcredit providers have shifted their focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably.  Analyst David Roodman contends that in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref> \n\nProfessor [[Dean Karlan]] from [[Yale University]] advocates also giving the poor access to savings accounts.<ref name=Karlan>BBC:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003s71s Business Weekly], 2 August 2009</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cooperative banking]]\n* [[Count Me In (charity)]]\n* [[Crowdfunding]]\n* [[Crowd sourcing]]\n* [[Flat rate (finance)]]\n* [[Microcredit for water supply and sanitation]]\n* [[Microgrant]]\n* [[M-Pesa]]\n* [[Project Enterprise]]\n* [[Solidarity lending]]\n* [[The Women's Development Bank]]\n* [[Oikocredit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adams, Dale, Doug Graham and J.D.

Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities.

Another WWW-based microlender, [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans.

Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%.<ref name=\"HighRates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/app.php?page=help&action=InterestRateComparison#AverageInterestRateBorrowerPaysToKivaFieldPartner|title=Kiva Help - Interest Rate Comparison|publisher=Kiva.org|accessdate=October 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803220548/http://www.kiva.org/about/app.php?page=help&action=InterestRateComparison#AverageInterestRateBorrowerPaysToKivaFieldPartner|archivedate=August 3, 2009}}</ref>  Rather, the principal reason for the high cost of microcredit loans is the high transaction cost of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance#interestRatesAreHigh|title=How Kiva works - Kiva|publisher=}}</ref>  Microcredit practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable.  The result is that the traditional approach to microcredit has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microcredit loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Borrowers who do not manage to earn a rate of return at least equal to the interest rate may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans. According to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans.<ref>http://centerforfinancialinclusionblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/111108_cfi_over-indebtedness-in-ghana_jessica-schicks_en_final.pdf</ref> In recent years, microcredit providers have shifted their focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably.  Analyst David Roodman contends that in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref> \n\nProfessor [[Dean Karlan]] from [[Yale University]] advocates also giving the poor access to savings accounts.<ref name=Karlan>BBC:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003s71s Business Weekly], 2 August 2009</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cooperative banking]]\n* [[Count Me In (charity)]]\n* [[Crowdfunding]]\n* [[Crowd sourcing]]\n* [[Flat rate (finance)]]\n* [[Microcredit for water supply and sanitation]]\n* [[Microgrant]]\n* [[M-Pesa]]\n* [[Project Enterprise]]\n* [[Solidarity lending]]\n* [[The Women's Development Bank]]\n* [[Oikocredit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adams, Dale, Doug Graham and J.D.
