The Hummelstown Historical Society is both a museum and [[visitor center]]. The town is home to a historical landmark, the Warwick Hotel, which is still a [[tavern]] reminiscent of its pre-[[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] days. [[George Washington]] stayed a night there and drank from its bar.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[Indian Echo Caverns]], located one-half mile south of the borough limits, is one of the main attractions near Hummelstown. The caverns were originally used by the [[Susquehannock]] tribe, who lived and hunted in the nearby area until they vanished in the 1670s; it opened to the public in 1929.\n\nThe [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] [[Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad]] operates heritage and freight service between its namesake towns of [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown]] and just south of Hummelstown proper, stopping in front of the Indian Echo Caverns entrance. The Hummelstown Borough Council has expressed concern around quality of life issues (noise, odor, safety) with having more trains passing through town. As such, trains stop just south of the busy four-lane [[U.S. Route 322]] grade crossing on a regular basis, and are allowed to enter town exactly 12 times per year.<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2009/04/hummelstown_wants_hearing_on_m.html pennlive.com]</ref> [[Norfolk Southern]]'s busy [[Harrisburg Line]] traverses the northern section of Hummelstown, with up to 20 lengthy freight trains passing through daily.\n\n===In the town===\nIn the town there is an [[American Legion]], a borough office building, and a post office. The legion and the post office are located on Walton Avenue (Main Street). The borough office building is located on South Hanover Street. The town has several bars, including the Warwick Hotel, the Boro Bar, and Chicks. The town also has several churches, most located on Main Street.\n\nThe Hummelstown Chemical Fire Department occasionally serves as a distribution center for Potassium Iodide pills supplied by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Hummelstown falls within a 10-mile radius of Three Mile Island.\n\n===Religion===\nAs much of Pennsylvania, in the initial days of its founding, Hummelstown had a large base of [[Quakers]]. As the town grew, other Protestant denominations such as [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], and [[Presbyterian]] developed.\n\n==Parks and recreation==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}\n{{See also|List of Pennsylvania state parks}}\n[[File:BPpavilion.JPG|left|thumb|The Pavilion at Herbert A.

The population was 1,003 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\nThe Hulme family name, originally DeHoulme, is of [[Normans|Norman]] origin, dating from [[William the Conqueror]]. Members of the family originally settled in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], a branch later moved to [[Cheshire]]. The American family came from this branch. George Hulme, Sr. and George Hulme, Jr. immigrated to [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]] from [[Tilston]], Cheshire about 1700, purchasing land and settled in [[Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Middletown Township]], some of the family later relocating to [[Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Buckingham]]. John Hulme, Sr., grandson of George, Sr., and his son, George Hulme, Jr. moved from Buckingham to [[Fallsington, Pennsylvania|Fallsington]] and ran a weaving business until 1796 when John, Jr. purchased land along the [[Neshaminy Creek]] and called it Milford. John, Jr. married Rebecca Milnor daughter of [[William Milnor]].<ref name=\"MacReynolds\">MacReynolds, George, ''Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania'', Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, P199.</ref>\n\nWithin a few years, the village built up to a number of dwellings, mills and other shops. The five sons of John, Jr. became a miller, two storekeepers, a tanner and a farmer. There was no public house, but John, Jr. many times opened his house to travelers. One autumn day in 1809, [[Josiah Quincy III]] stayed overnight on the way from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to [[Washington, D.C.]]. John, Jr. served a term in the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] and helped start a post office at Milford established on 1 October 1809, his son Isaac, the first postmaster. The village name then changed to Hulmeville. It is claimed that the General Assembly changed the name in honor of John, Jr.<ref name=\"MacReynolds\"/>\n\nThe first bank in Bucks County was organized in 1814, John, Jr. the first president.

[[Pennsylvania]], United States. The population was 1,003 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\nThe Hulme family name, originally DeHoulme, is of [[Normans|Norman]] origin, dating from [[William the Conqueror]]. Members of the family originally settled in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], a branch later moved to [[Cheshire]]. The American family came from this branch. George Hulme, Sr. and George Hulme, Jr. immigrated to [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]] from [[Tilston]], Cheshire about 1700, purchasing land and settled in [[Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Middletown Township]], some of the family later relocating to [[Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Buckingham]]. John Hulme, Sr., grandson of George, Sr., and his son, George Hulme, Jr. moved from Buckingham to [[Fallsington, Pennsylvania|Fallsington]] and ran a weaving business until 1796 when John, Jr. purchased land along the [[Neshaminy Creek]] and called it Milford. John, Jr. married Rebecca Milnor daughter of [[William Milnor]]. <ref name=\"MacReynolds\">MacReynolds, George, ''Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania'', Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, P199.</ref>\n\nWithin a few years, the village built up to a number of dwellings, mills and other shops. The five sons of John, Jr. became a miller, two storekeepers, a tanner and a farmer. There was no public house, but John, Jr. many times opened his house to travelers. One autumn day in 1809, [[Josiah Quincy III]] stayed overnight on the way from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to [[Washington, D.C.]]. John, Jr. served a term in the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] and helped start a post office at Milford established on 1 October 1809, his son Isaac, the first postmaster. The village name then changed to Hulmeville. It is claimed that the General Assembly changed the name in honor of John, Jr.<ref name=\"MacReynolds\"/>\n\nThe first bank in Bucks County was organized in 1814, John, Jr. the first president. The bank moved to Bristol in 1830 and its name was changed to Farmers' National Bank.<ref name=\"MacReynolds\"/>\n\nThe [[Hulmeville Historic District]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nHulmeville is located at {{Coord|40|8|36|N|74|54|26|W|type:city}} (40.143259, -74.907118).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n[[Neshaminy Creek]] passes through Hulmeville.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{stack|{{US Census population\n|1880= 376\n|1890= 418\n|1900= 454\n|1910= 468\n|1920= 491\n|1930= 582\n|1940= 694\n|1950= 860\n|1960= 968\n|1970= 906\n|1980= 1014\n|1990= 916\n|2000= 893\n|2010= 1003\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=999\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=February 20, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.dvrpc.org/data/databull/rdb/db82/appedixa.xls</ref>\n}}\n}}\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the borough was 93.5% Non-Hispanic White, 0.7% Black or African American, 3.0% Asian, and 2.4% were two or more races. 1.0% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA</ref>\n[[File:Hulmeville Inn.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Downtown Hulmeville]]\n[[File:Hulmeville historical marker.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Historical marker in Hulmeville]]\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 893 people, 339 households, and 233 families residing in the borough.

It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in [[India]], [[Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]] and ritualistic [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] as the villains again, [[George Lucas]], executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas' collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, and [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas. The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its dark tone. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

With his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft just before it crashes into the mountainside. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by [[Shiva]] to retrieve the sacred [[lingam]] stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\n\nThe trio receives a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay for the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young [[Maharaja]], Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is wrong. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\n\nThe trio reaches an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thuggees chain one of their victims in a cage, and the high priest Mola Ram uses his evil magic to rip out the victim's still-beating heart. While the victim is still alive, he is slowly lowered into a lava pit, burning him alive, with his heart held in Mola Ram's hand burning as well. They discover that Mola Ram, who has plans for world domination, and the Thuggees are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, which were hidden in the catacombs by a priest when the British invaded, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two, as well as to mine jewels to fund their operations. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is [[Flagellation|whipped]] and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thuggees. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes via a trapdoor under the Sankara stones' altar. Indy retrieves the stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh\u2014also under Mola Ram's control\u2014tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a steamroller. Singh then tells Shorty how to get out of the mine.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a minecart, pursued by Thuggees, while Mola Ram orders a huge water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with a sword, leaving them to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of [[Shiva]] by proclaiming him to be a traitor, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to be devoured alive by the crocodiles below. Losing two, Indy catches the last stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot Indy. Gaining the upper hand, the British army has them surrounded forcing the Thuggee to surrender. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in [[India]], [[Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]] and ritualistic [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] as the villains again, [[George Lucas]], executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas' collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, and [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas. The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its dark tone. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

With his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft just before it crashes into the mountainside. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by [[Shiva]] to retrieve the sacred [[lingam]] stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\n\nThe trio receives a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay for the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young [[Maharaja]], Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is wrong. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\n\nThe trio reaches an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thuggees chain one of their victims in a cage, and the high priest Mola Ram uses his evil magic to rip out the victim's still-beating heart. While the victim is still alive, he is slowly lowered into a lava pit, burning him alive, with his heart held in Mola Ram's hand burning as well. They discover that Mola Ram, who has plans for world domination, and the Thuggees are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, which were hidden in the catacombs by a priest when the British invaded, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two, as well as to mine jewels to fund their operations. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is [[Flagellation|whipped]] and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thuggees. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes via a trapdoor under the Sankara stones' altar. Indy retrieves the stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh\u2014also under Mola Ram's control\u2014tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a steamroller. Singh then tells Shorty how to get out of the mine.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a minecart, pursued by Thuggees, while Mola Ram orders a huge water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with a sword, leaving them to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of [[Shiva]] by proclaiming him to be a traitor, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to be devoured alive by the crocodiles below. Losing two, Indy catches the last stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot Indy. Gaining the upper hand, the British army has them surrounded forcing the Thuggee to surrender. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

Capshaw learned to sing in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and took [[tap dance]] lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw was not able to dance in it. Made by [[Barbara Matera (costume designer)|Barbara Matera]] out of original 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an [[elephant]] had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was [[costume design]]er [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] who had to fill in the insurance forms. As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put \"dress eaten by elephant\".<ref name=making/> \n\nIn a 2003 documentary on the making of the film (first released when the original trilogy made its debut on DVD), costume designer Anthony Powell stated that only one evening dress was made for Capshaw due to the limited amount of original 1920's and 1930's beads and sequins (story above). However, there have been more than one of these dresses on display at the same time in different countries, so this story cannot be entirely true - from late 2014, a dress was on display at the Hollywood Costume exhibition in Los Angeles (exhibition ran from October 2, 2014 - March 2, 2015). At the very same time, the travelling \"Indiana Jones: Adventure of Archaeology\" exhibition was on display in Edmonton in Canada (October 11, 2014 - April 6, 2015) and there featured another of the red & gold dresses. It has also been confirmed by an embroiderer working at Barbara Matera Ltd at the time, that three dresses were in fact made initially - One for Kate, one for the stunt double, and one \"just in case\".\n\nProduction designer [[Norman Reynolds]] could not return for ''Temple of Doom'' because of his commitment to ''[[Return to Oz]]''. [[Elliot Scott]] (''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''), Reynolds' mentor, was hired. To build the [[rope bridge]] the filmmakers found a group of British engineers from [[Balfour Beatty]] working on the nearby [[Victoria Dam (Sri Lanka)|Victoria Dam]].<ref name=complete/> [[Harrison Ford]] suffered a severe [[spinal disc herniation]] by performing a somersault while filming the scene with the assassin in Jones' bedroom. A hospital bed was brought on set for Ford to rest between [[Take#Film|takes]]. Lucas stated, \"He could barely stand up, yet he was there every day so shooting would not stop. He was in incomprehensible pain, but he was still trying to make it happen.\"<ref name=Baxter/> With no alternatives, Lucas shut down production while Ford was flown to [[Centinela Freeman Regional Medical Center, Centinela Campus|Centinela Hospital]] on June 21 for recovery.<ref name=doom/> [[Stunt double]] [[Vic Armstrong]] spent five weeks as a [[stand-in]] for various shots.

Jessica Jackley worked at the school and invited Matt Flannery to attend the presentation; this was the first time  Flannery had heard of microfinance, but it served as a \"call to action\" for Jackley. Soon after, Jackley began working as a consultant for the nonprofit [[Village Enterprise]], which worked to help start small businesses in [[East Africa]]. While Flannery was visiting Jackley in Africa, the two spent time interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they faced in starting ventures and found the lack of access to start-up capital was a common theme. After returning from Africa, the two began developing their plan for a microfinance project that would grow into Kiva, which means \"unity\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Flannery | first1 = M. | title = Kiva and the Birth of Person-to-Person Microfinance | journal = Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization | volume = 2 | pages = 31\u201356 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.1-2.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narang |first1=Sonia |year=2006 |title=Web-Based Microfinancing |journal=New York Times Magazine  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html?ex=1323406800&en=72e9b0bb93393330&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, Kiva's first seven loans were funded, totaling $3,500, and the original entrepreneurs were subsequently deemed the \"Dream Team.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/history| title=History| publisher=Kiva.org| accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> By September 2005, the entrepreneurs repaid the entirety of their original loans, and the founders realized they had developed a sustainable microcredit concept. After the success of Kiva's initial stage, Flannery and Jackley founded Kiva as a non-profit. In 2006, notable entrepreneurs and businessmen joined Kiva's staff, including [[Premal Shah]] from PayPal and [[Reid Hoffman]], CEO and founder of [[LinkedIn]]. Shortly after its first anniversary in October 2006, Kiva reached $1 million in facilitated loans and acquired its twentieth field partner.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} To the present day, Kiva has continued to grow and expand its field partners while acquiring support from the media and the public.\n\n== Lending process ==\nKiva works with more than 300 [[microfinance]] institutions, social impact businesses, schools and non-profit organizations around the world, called \"Field Partners,\" that post profiles of qualified local entrepreneurs on the Kiva website. Lenders browse borrower profiles on kiva.org and choose an entrepreneur they wish to fund.

Kristof]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn]] highlight Kiva's work along with that of some field partner organizations, such as the Kashf Foundation in [[Pakistan]]. With microloans, women gain spending power and spend less on instant gratification vices like alcohol and drugs. With extra income, they are able to educate their children, renovate their residences, or buy modern technologies and medicines. Along with economic power, a woman with a microloan often gains more independence and respect from her husband. Kristof and WuDunn note that microfinance can be a risky path out of poverty. \"[Paying back the loan with interest] is fine when the money is pumped into a profitable new business, but if the money isn't invested soundly, then the borrowers become trapped in mounting debts.\" Nonetheless, the authors endorse Kiva and similar microfinance efforts, writing that \"microfinance has done more to bolster the status of women, and to protect them from abuse, than any laws could accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Half the Sky|url=https://archive.org/details/halfsky00nich|url-access=registration|authors=Kristof, Nicholas D., Sheryl WuDunn|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Green loans ===\nIn 2011, Kiva added a new category of loans to help borrowers move to cleaner and safer forms of energy, green agriculture, transport and recycling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Micro-lending site Kiva goes green|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/micro-lending-site-kiva-goes-green/|publisher=Venturebeat}}</ref> Green Kiva loans help fund solar panels, organic fertilizers, high-efficiency stoves, [[drip irrigation]] systems, and biofuels.

Kiva Zip transfers funds directly to borrowers without outsourcing disbursements and repayment collection to field partners.  Instead, Kiva Zip partners with local institutions called Trustees, who vet loan applicants, provide mentorship, and may post profiles and updates on their behalf.  Currently, Kiva Zip borrowers do not pay any interest or fees.  Lenders are protected from currency risk but do not earn interest.  Kiva Zip is considered an experimental platform, and offers loans in the United States and in Kenya.  In the future, it hopes to expand to other locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zip.kiva.org/faq# |title=Kiva Zip: FAQ|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>  Kiva Zip's repayment rate is 89.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zip.kiva.org/|title=Kiva Zip: Innovations in Person-to-Person Lending|accessdate=26 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142613/https://zip.kiva.org/|archive-date=April 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Interest rates by field partner====\n\nAs of November 2018, there are a total of 332 field partners listed on the Kiva website and their status is as follows: 173 Active, 41 Inactive, 14 Paused, and 104 Experimental.

Since then, the system has changed, so that loans are disbursed to borrowers before their stories are posted to Kiva's website.<ref name=\"cgdev\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems |last=Roodman |first=David |date=2 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075941/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Kiva&st=cse |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Disbursing loans sooner has a positive impact on the borrowers, who no longer need to wait weeks to receive their funding and can thus take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities. This is disclosed on Kiva's site; each loan proposal states whether funds were pre-disbursed. Thus, lenders' loan funds are likely to go to borrowers other than those chosen by the lenders.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> However, since the pay-back behaviour of the specific borrower chosen by the lender ''does'' influence whether or not the lender gets their funds back (except when an MFI has chosen to cover for borrower defaults), there is at least some connection between the lender and the specific borrower. Whether lenders' preferences are used for lender preference trend analysis by any field partners or Kiva is not stated. Kiva's response has been to keep pre-disbursing but be clearer about the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/matt-flannery-kiva-ceo-and-co-founder-replies.php |title=Matt Flannery, Kiva CEO and Co-Founder, Replies |last=Flannery |first=Matt |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Full-repayment frequency uncertainty===\n\nWhether defaults are extremely low has been questioned on the ground that a field partner may pay Kiva for loans defaulted to the field partner in order to maintain the field partner's good credit with Kiva.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> Whether [[interest rate]]s collected by field partners are enough to pay for significant defaults depends on local economic conditions for each field partner.\n\n===Controversial loans===\n\nIn 2008, Kiva featured the borrowing profile of a Peruvian woman asking for a loan to buy equipment for her [[cockfighting]] business.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|title=Cockfighting|last=Flannery|first=Matt|authorlink=|date=29 March 2008|work=|publisher=[[Skoll Foundation]]|doi=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506203625/http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|archive-date=2008-05-06|accessdate=15 September 2010|coauthors=}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodsports_sfweekly\">\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Smiley\n  | first = Lauren\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kiva's Microloans Underwriting Cockfighting in Peru\n  | newspaper = SF Weekly\n  | location = San Francisco\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =27 February 2008\n  | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-02-27/news/kiva-s-micro-loans-underwriting-cockfighting-in-peru/\n  | accessdate =15 September 2010 }}</ref> This sparked debate among the Kiva Lending Community about the principles of the organization, and many complained that the organization was promoting cruelty to animals. Matt Flannery responded to the debate by providing an overview of the legal issues surrounding the debate, and took a more relativist stance. Flannery wrote on Socialedge.org \u2014 a blog site designed to connect entrepreneurs for social benefit \u2014\n\n<blockquote>I think that allowing our partner to decide which loans to post without much interference is a good thing. We can be paternalistic when we start imposing our moral framework upon societies half a world away. Cockfighting in Peru is legal and part of a rich cultural tradition. It may not be humane or palatable from a Western perspective, but that misses the point. Kiva, the organization, should not be making those decisions. Our lenders should be the ones voting with their dollars.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis position has caused some lenders to pull their funds (often moving them to other microfinance sites such as [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], [[Zidisha]].org, [[Wokai]], [[Energy in Common]], etc.). Others who wanted to continue to lend through Kiva created \"Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\" in May 2009, and, as of June 8, 2012, it has lent $15,625 to borrowers pursuing projects that do not involve the harming of animals.<ref name=\"bloodsports_kacl_team\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.kiva.org/team/kacl\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy regarding Strathmore University and Opus Dei===\n\nIn Spring 2013, one of Kiva's field partners, [[Strathmore University]], posted many large loans to cover full tuitions for students from low-income regions in Kenya who could not otherwise afford higher education.  Kiva also established a field office on the Strathmore campus.  Shortly after, many lenders raised concerns because Strathmore University is a corporate undertaking of [[Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strathmore.edu/en/about-strathmore/opus-dei|title=Strathmore University - Opus Dei |publisher=Strathmore University |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> This spawned a debate in the Kiva forums, leading to an open letter from Kiva's CEO Matt Flannery addressing the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/28/an-open-letter-about-kiva-and-strathmore|title=An Open Letter About Kiva and Strathmore |publisher=Kiva.org |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Promotions and marketing strategies ==\n\nIn March 2012, [[Reid Hoffman]], LinkedIn's co-founder, lent Kiva $1 million. Kiva then allowed 40,000 people to lend $25 for \"free.\" Lenders still choose a borrower, but the borrower will pay back Hoffman instead of the lender who chose them. Kiva hopes that the \"free\" users will lend to more of their projects, and thus increase their overall user base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/15/725000-loans-granted-by-kiva-2-6-billion-to-go/|title=725,000 Loans Granted By Kiva, 2.6 Billion To Go|author=Pan, Joann|publisher=Mashable Business|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book ''[[Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World]]'', Bill Clinton covers Kiva.org and the work the organization is currently doing and has done in the past.\n\n== External reviews ==\n\nThe following independent entities have reviewed Kiva.\n\n* On October 1, 2019, charity evaluator [[Charity Navigator]] downgraded Kiva from 4 (out of 4) to 3 stars;

Jessica Jackley worked at the school and invited Matt Flannery to attend the presentation; this was the first time  Flannery had heard of microfinance, but it served as a \"call to action\" for Jackley. Soon after, Jackley began working as a consultant for the nonprofit [[Village Enterprise]], which worked to help start small businesses in [[East Africa]]. While Flannery was visiting Jackley in Africa, the two spent time interviewing entrepreneurs about the problems they faced in starting ventures and found the lack of access to start-up capital was a common theme. After returning from Africa, the two began developing their plan for a microfinance project that would grow into Kiva, which means \"unity\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Flannery | first1 = M. | title = Kiva and the Birth of Person-to-Person Microfinance | journal = Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization | volume = 2 | pages = 31\u201356 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.1-2.31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Narang |first1=Sonia |year=2006 |title=Web-Based Microfinancing |journal=New York Times Magazine  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html?ex=1323406800&en=72e9b0bb93393330&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, Kiva's first seven loans were funded, totaling $3,500, and the original entrepreneurs were subsequently deemed the \"Dream Team.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/history| title=History| publisher=Kiva.org| accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> By September 2005, the entrepreneurs repaid the entirety of their original loans, and the founders realized they had developed a sustainable microcredit concept.

Kristof]] and [[Sheryl WuDunn]] highlight Kiva's work along with that of some field partner organizations, such as the Kashf Foundation in [[Pakistan]]. With microloans, women gain spending power and spend less on instant gratification vices like alcohol and drugs. With extra income, they are able to educate their children, renovate their residences, or buy modern technologies and medicines. Along with economic power, a woman with a microloan often gains more independence and respect from her husband. Kristof and WuDunn note that microfinance can be a risky path out of poverty. \"[Paying back the loan with interest] is fine when the money is pumped into a profitable new business, but if the money isn't invested soundly, then the borrowers become trapped in mounting debts.\" Nonetheless, the authors endorse Kiva and similar microfinance efforts, writing that \"microfinance has done more to bolster the status of women, and to protect them from abuse, than any laws could accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Half the Sky|url=https://archive.org/details/halfsky00nich|url-access=registration|authors=Kristof, Nicholas D., Sheryl WuDunn|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Green loans ===\nIn 2011, Kiva added a new category of loans to help borrowers move to cleaner and safer forms of energy, green agriculture, transport and recycling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=Micro-lending site Kiva goes green|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/micro-lending-site-kiva-goes-green/|publisher=Venturebeat}}</ref> Green Kiva loans help fund solar panels, organic fertilizers, high-efficiency stoves, [[drip irrigation]] systems, and biofuels.

Currently, Kiva Zip borrowers do not pay any interest or fees.  Lenders are protected from currency risk but do not earn interest.

Since then, the system has changed, so that loans are disbursed to borrowers before their stories are posted to Kiva's website.<ref name=\"cgdev\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |title=Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems |last=Roodman |first=David |date=2 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118075941/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |first=Stephanie |last=Strom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Kiva&st=cse |newspaper=New York Times |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> Disbursing loans sooner has a positive impact on the borrowers, who no longer need to wait weeks to receive their funding and can thus take advantage of time-sensitive business opportunities. This is disclosed on Kiva's site; each loan proposal states whether funds were pre-disbursed. Thus, lenders' loan funds are likely to go to borrowers other than those chosen by the lenders.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> However, since the pay-back behaviour of the specific borrower chosen by the lender ''does'' influence whether or not the lender gets their funds back (except when an MFI has chosen to cover for borrower defaults), there is at least some connection between the lender and the specific borrower. Whether lenders' preferences are used for lender preference trend analysis by any field partners or Kiva is not stated. Kiva's response has been to keep pre-disbursing but be clearer about the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/matt-flannery-kiva-ceo-and-co-founder-replies.php |title=Matt Flannery, Kiva CEO and Co-Founder, Replies |last=Flannery |first=Matt |date=12 October 2009 |publisher=Center for Global Development |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Full-repayment frequency uncertainty===\n\nWhether defaults are extremely low has been questioned on the ground that a field partner may pay Kiva for loans defaulted to the field partner in order to maintain the field partner's good credit with Kiva.<ref name=\"cgdev\"/> Whether [[interest rate]]s collected by field partners are enough to pay for significant defaults depends on local economic conditions for each field partner.\n\n===Controversial loans===\n\nIn 2008, Kiva featured the borrowing profile of a Peruvian woman asking for a loan to buy equipment for her [[cockfighting]] business.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\">{{cite web|url=http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|title=Cockfighting|last=Flannery|first=Matt|authorlink=|date=29 March 2008|work=|publisher=[[Skoll Foundation]]|doi=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506203625/http://www.socialedge.org/blogs/kiva-chronicles/topics/cockfighting|archive-date=2008-05-06|accessdate=15 September 2010|coauthors=}}</ref><ref name=\"bloodsports_sfweekly\">\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Smiley\n  | first = Lauren\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kiva's Microloans Underwriting Cockfighting in Peru\n  | newspaper = SF Weekly\n  | location = San Francisco\n  | pages =\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =27 February 2008\n  | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2008-02-27/news/kiva-s-micro-loans-underwriting-cockfighting-in-peru/\n  | accessdate =15 September 2010 }}</ref> This sparked debate among the Kiva Lending Community about the principles of the organization, and many complained that the organization was promoting cruelty to animals. Matt Flannery responded to the debate by providing an overview of the legal issues surrounding the debate, and took a more relativist stance. Flannery wrote on Socialedge.org \u2014 a blog site designed to connect entrepreneurs for social benefit \u2014\n\n<blockquote>I think that allowing our partner to decide which loans to post without much interference is a good thing. We can be paternalistic when we start imposing our moral framework upon societies half a world away. Cockfighting in Peru is legal and part of a rich cultural tradition. It may not be humane or palatable from a Western perspective, but that misses the point. Kiva, the organization, should not be making those decisions. Our lenders should be the ones voting with their dollars.<ref name=\"bloodsports_flannery_blog_post\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis position has caused some lenders to pull their funds (often moving them to other microfinance sites such as [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], [[Zidisha]].org, [[Wokai]], [[Energy in Common]], etc.). Others who wanted to continue to lend through Kiva created \"Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\" in May 2009, and, as of June 8, 2012, it has lent $15,625 to borrowers pursuing projects that do not involve the harming of animals.<ref name=\"bloodsports_kacl_team\">\n{{cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Kivans Against Cockfighting Loans\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.kiva.org/team/kacl\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy regarding Strathmore University and Opus Dei===\n\nIn Spring 2013, one of Kiva's field partners, [[Strathmore University]], posted many large loans to cover full tuitions for students from low-income regions in Kenya who could not otherwise afford higher education.  Kiva also established a field office on the Strathmore campus.  Shortly after, many lenders raised concerns because Strathmore University is a corporate undertaking of [[Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strathmore.edu/en/about-strathmore/opus-dei|title=Strathmore University - Opus Dei |publisher=Strathmore University |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> This spawned a debate in the Kiva forums, leading to an open letter from Kiva's CEO Matt Flannery addressing the issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pages.kiva.org/kivablog/2013/08/28/an-open-letter-about-kiva-and-strathmore|title=An Open Letter About Kiva and Strathmore |publisher=Kiva.org |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Promotions and marketing strategies ==\n\nIn March 2012, [[Reid Hoffman]], LinkedIn's co-founder, lent Kiva $1 million. Kiva then allowed 40,000 people to lend $25 for \"free.\" Lenders still choose a borrower, but the borrower will pay back Hoffman instead of the lender who chose them. Kiva hopes that the \"free\" users will lend to more of their projects, and thus increase their overall user base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/15/725000-loans-granted-by-kiva-2-6-billion-to-go/|title=725,000 Loans Granted By Kiva, 2.6 Billion To Go|author=Pan, Joann|publisher=Mashable Business|accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book ''[[Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World]]'', Bill Clinton covers Kiva.org and the work the organization is currently doing and has done in the past.\n\n== External reviews ==\n\nThe following independent entities have reviewed Kiva.\n\n* On October 1, 2019, charity evaluator [[Charity Navigator]] downgraded Kiva from 4 (out of 4) to 3 stars;

Immediately, guests and the press dubbed the hotel as a \"distinct step forward in Southern hoteldom\" and a \"Parisian hotel on a noted boulevard in a metropolitan city\". Over subsequent decades, the hotel would be referred to as the \"Grand Old Lady of Peachtree\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nSince its opening, the hotel has been the place for numerous historical events and housed several prominent guests, including [[Clark Gable]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[John J. Pershing]], [[Walt Disney]], and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].\n\nStarting in 1913, famous Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] along with members of [[The Metropolitan Opera]] used the hotel as their Atlanta headquarters when they came yearly to the city to perform in spring concerts. Once the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] opened across the street from the hotel in 1929, traffic on Peachtree Street would be stopped and a red carpet rolled from the door of the hotel to the theatre entrance, allowing the opera stars and other celebrities staying at the hotel to make a grand entrance into the theatre before their shows started.\n\n[[File:Front of Georgian Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Historic Front Entrance]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Arthur Murray]], who was then a student at [[Georgia Tech]], started teaching dance classes in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. This enterprise eventually spawned his franchised-branded dance lesson business. In 1926, Georgia's chief investigator for the Solicitor General, Bert Donaldson, was murdered at the hotel. It was thought that this planned \"hit\" was evidence of Atlanta's underworld connections to [[organized crime]].\n\nIn 1935, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] editor Harold Latham decided to stay at the hotel while scouting the Atlanta area for new writers and manuscripts. While in town, he met Peggy Mitchell Marsh, whom he was introduced to through a mutual acquaintance. This mutual acquaintance also had told Latham that Marsh had written a novel about Atlanta during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. After several failed attempts to obtain the manuscript from Marsh, Latham finally succeeded in getting it from her in the lobby of the hotel as he was about to depart for [[New Orleans]]. Upon handing the manuscript to Latham, Marsh said, \"If you really want it you may take it, but it is incomplete and unrevised.\"<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by [[Anne Edwards]], 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref> That unfinished novel was completed and published in 1936 as ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1937. While she insisted on using her married name socially, the book was published under her maiden name of [[Margaret Mitchell]].<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by Anne Edwards, 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 1939, the Georgian Terrace Hotel's Grand Ballroom was the site of the ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Gala, whose attendees included [[Clark Gable]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Victor Fleming]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], [[David O. Selznick]], Margaret Mitchell, and several other notable guests.\n\nThe premiere of ''Gone with the Wind'' was in Atlanta in 1939. All of the stars and the Director of the movie (with the exception of Vivien Leigh and her lover at the time, Lawrence Olivier) stayed at the Georgian Terrace. The pre-premiere party was held at the hotel.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the premier showing of ''Gone With the Wind'' was not held at the Fox Theatre, but rather at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] in downtown Atlanta. After the movie was screened there, its stars were ushered to the Georgian Terrace via a motorcade through a parade route on Peachtree Street.\n\nDuring the premiere of ''[[Song of the South]]'', which did take place at the Fox Theatre, [[Walt Disney]] stayed at the hotel. He returned to his room before the film started; unexpected audience reactions of any kind upset him and he preferred not to watch it with the audience.\n\nThe Georgian Terrace Hotel saw quite a few changes in the 1940s. It had become a residential hotel in 1945 and had been modernized with air-conditioning, new plumbing, and some interior changes. In 1945, the prominent tile-buttressed, shed roof cornice was removed.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Grand Ballroom was turned into the [[Alex Cooley's Electric Ballroom|Electric Ballroom]] by concert promoters Alex Cooley and Mark Golob. Musical performers providing concerts at the hotel included [[Billy Joel]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The 1974 film ''[[Cockfighter]]'', starring [[Warren Oates]], features some scenes that were shot at the Georgian Terrace.<ref>''Warren Oates: a wild life'' by Susan Compo, 2009, The University Press of Kentucky</ref>\n\nBy 1981, revenues were in steady decline and the hotel closed its doors for the first time in its 70-year history. By the middle of that decade, the hotel had been boarded up and condemned. In 1986, however, the hotel was listed as a part of the \"Fox Theatre District\" on the National Register of Historic Places, which successfully blocked plans for its demolition.\n\nThe 1990s saw a rebirth of the hotel. In 1991, the hotel was converted into a luxury apartment building, and a new 19-story wing complete with a roof-top pool was built to resemble the original 10-story Beaux-Arts-style hotel. In 1997, the apartments were vacated, and the property reopened as a luxury hotel.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century has seen two major renovations done at the hotel, one in 2000 and one in 2009, which included the opening of Livingston's Restaurant and Bar and Mims Caf\u00e9, both named after early Atlanta Mayor [[Livingston Mims]], who had built his house in 1879 on the corner where the hotel now stands.\n\nIn April 2007, the hotel was used by [[Robert Rodriguez]] to film a [[Bacardi|Bacardi Global Brands]] commercial for the European market titled [http://www.youtubekeep.com/watch-video/el-toro-starring-george-clooney-60sec-generic-s/122656/ El Toro]. This commercial starred [[George Clooney]], Jamie King, and [[Leonor Varela]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the Georgian Terrace's Grand Ballroom was used as a filming location for the [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] film ''[[The Change-Up]]''. In the film, the ballroom doubles as Plantation Oaks Country Club.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Commercial District Tour Guide PC\"/><ref name=\"atlantaga.gov\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2010/11/22/another-ryan-reynolds-jason-bateman-sighting/ |title=''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', November 24, 2010 |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125150536/http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2010/11/22/another-ryan-reynolds-jason-bateman-sighting/ |archive-date=November 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com/explore/hotel.cfm/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327215721/http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com/explore/hotel.cfm# |archive-date=2010-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|33.7726|-84.3846|type:landmark_region:US-GA|display=title}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Georgian Terrace Hotel}}\n*[http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com] Official website\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/fulton/the-georgian-terrace-hotel The Georgian Terrace Hotel] historical marker\n\n{{Atlanta landmarks}}\n\n[[Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1911]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper hotels in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:William Lee Stoddart buildings]]\n[[Category:1911 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Historic Hotels Worldwide]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2020}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = March 2020}}\n{{Infobox hotel\n| hotel_name = Georgian Terrace Hotel\n| image = Hotels_around_Fabulous_Fox_Theater_cropped.jpg\n| caption = Georgian Terrace Hotel in 2008\n| location = 659 Peachtree Street NE,<br />[[Atlanta]]\n| opening_date = 1911 (addition in 1991)\n| developer = Joseph F.

Rich and Brothers Co., later [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Atlanta Historic Resources Workbook'' by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission, September 1981</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta'': University of Georgia Press, 1993</ref><ref name=\"Commercial District Tour Guide PC\">Atlanta Preservation Center's ''SoNo/Midtown Commercial District Tour Guide'': APC, 2009</ref><ref name=\"atlantaga.gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/urbandesign_georgianterr.aspx/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035941/http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/urbandesign_georgianterr.aspx# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''The Ponce Lobby'' by Richard Flinn, Director of Restoration for The Fox Theatre; 1981?, [Atlanta?], Ga.: n.p.</ref><ref>''Rich's of Atlanta: The Story of a Store since 1867'' by Henry Givens Baker, 1953, Foote and Davies</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn October 2, 1911, thousands of guests from Atlanta and other cities attended the opening night ceremonies of the Georgian Terrace Hotel, where they were entertained by a costumed-Spanish orchestra performing in the Grand Ballroom. Immediately, guests and the press dubbed the hotel as a \"distinct step forward in Southern hoteldom\" and a \"Parisian hotel on a noted boulevard in a metropolitan city\". Over subsequent decades, the hotel would be referred to as the \"Grand Old Lady of Peachtree\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nSince its opening, the hotel has been the place for numerous historical events and housed several prominent guests, including [[Clark Gable]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[John J. Pershing]], [[Walt Disney]], and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].\n\nStarting in 1913, famous Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] along with members of [[The Metropolitan Opera]] used the hotel as their Atlanta headquarters when they came yearly to the city to perform in spring concerts. Once the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] opened across the street from the hotel in 1929, traffic on Peachtree Street would be stopped and a red carpet rolled from the door of the hotel to the theatre entrance, allowing the opera stars and other celebrities staying at the hotel to make a grand entrance into the theatre before their shows started.\n\n[[File:Front of Georgian Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Historic Front Entrance]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Arthur Murray]], who was then a student at [[Georgia Tech]], started teaching dance classes in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. This enterprise eventually spawned his franchised-branded dance lesson business. In 1926, Georgia's chief investigator for the Solicitor General, Bert Donaldson, was murdered at the hotel. It was thought that this planned \"hit\" was evidence of Atlanta's underworld connections to [[organized crime]].\n\nIn 1935, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] editor Harold Latham decided to stay at the hotel while scouting the Atlanta area for new writers and manuscripts. While in town, he met Peggy Mitchell Marsh, whom he was introduced to through a mutual acquaintance. This mutual acquaintance also had told Latham that Marsh had written a novel about Atlanta during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. After several failed attempts to obtain the manuscript from Marsh, Latham finally succeeded in getting it from her in the lobby of the hotel as he was about to depart for [[New Orleans]]. Upon handing the manuscript to Latham, Marsh said, \"If you really want it you may take it, but it is incomplete and unrevised.\"<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by [[Anne Edwards]], 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref> That unfinished novel was completed and published in 1936 as ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1937. While she insisted on using her married name socially, the book was published under her maiden name of [[Margaret Mitchell]].<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by Anne Edwards, 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 1939, the Georgian Terrace Hotel's Grand Ballroom was the site of the ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Gala, whose attendees included [[Clark Gable]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Victor Fleming]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], [[David O. Selznick]], Margaret Mitchell, and several other notable guests.\n\nThe premiere of Gone with the Wind was in Atlanta in 1939. All of the stars and the Director of the movie (with the exception of Vivien Leigh and her lover at the time, Lawrence Olivier) stayed at the Georgian Terrace. The pre-premiere party was held at the hotel.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the premier showing of ''Gone With the Wind'' was not held at the Fox Theatre, but rather at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] in downtown Atlanta. After the movie was screened there, its stars were ushered to the Georgian Terrace via a motorcade through a parade route on Peachtree Street.\n\nDuring the premiere of ''[[Song of the South]]'', which did take place at the Fox Theatre, [[Walt Disney]] stayed at the hotel. He returned to his room before the film started; unexpected audience reactions of any kind upset him and he preferred not to watch it with the audience.\n\nThe Georgian Terrace Hotel saw quite a few changes in the 1940s. It had become a residential hotel in 1945 and had been modernized with air-conditioning, new plumbing, and some interior changes. In 1945, the prominent tile-buttressed, shed roof cornice was removed.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Grand Ballroom was turned into the [[Alex Cooley's Electric Ballroom|Electric Ballroom]] by concert promoters Alex Cooley and Mark Golob. Musical performers providing concerts at the hotel included [[Billy Joel]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The 1974 film ''[[Cockfighter]]'', starring [[Warren Oates]], features some scenes that were shot at the Georgian Terrace.<ref>''Warren Oates: a wild life'' by Susan Compo, 2009, The University Press of Kentucky</ref>\n\nBy 1981, revenues were in steady decline and the hotel closed its doors for the first time in its 70-year history. By the middle of that decade, the hotel had been boarded up and condemned. In 1986, however, the hotel was listed as a part of the \"Fox Theatre District\" on the National Register of Historic Places, which successfully blocked plans for its demolition.\n\nThe 1990s saw a rebirth of the hotel. In 1991, the hotel was converted into a luxury apartment building, and a new 19-story wing complete with a roof-top pool was built to resemble the original 10-story Beaux-Arts-style hotel. In 1997, the apartments were vacated, and the property reopened as a luxury hotel.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century has seen two major renovations done at the hotel, one in 2000 and one in 2009, which included the opening of Livingston's Restaurant and Bar and Mims Caf\u00e9, both named after early Atlanta Mayor [[Livingston Mims]], who had built his house in 1879 on the corner where the hotel now stands.\n\nIn April 2007, the hotel was used by [[Robert Rodriguez]] to film a [[Bacardi|Bacardi Global Brands]] commercial for the European market titled [http://www.youtubekeep.com/watch-video/el-toro-starring-george-clooney-60sec-generic-s/122656/ El Toro]. This commercial starred [[George Clooney]], Jamie King, and [[Leonor Varela]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the Georgian Terrace's Grand Ballroom was used as a filming location for the [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] film ''[[The Change-Up]]''. In the film, the ballroom doubles as Plantation Oaks Country Club.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Commercial District Tour Guide PC\"/><ref name=\"atlantaga.gov\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2010/11/22/another-ryan-reynolds-jason-bateman-sighting/ |title=''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', November 24, 2010 |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125150536/http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2010/11/22/another-ryan-reynolds-jason-bateman-sighting/ |archive-date=November 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com/explore/hotel.cfm/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327215721/http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com/explore/hotel.cfm# |archive-date=2010-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|33.7726|-84.3846|type:landmark_region:US-GA|display=title}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Georgian Terrace Hotel}}\n*[http://www.thegeorgianterrace.com] Official website\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/fulton/the-georgian-terrace-hotel The Georgian Terrace Hotel] historical marker\n\n{{Atlanta landmarks}}\n\n[[Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1911]]\n[[Category:Skyscraper hotels in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:William Lee Stoddart buildings]]\n[[Category:1911 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Historic Hotels Worldwide]]\n", "name_user": "Bubba73", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_Terrace_Hotel"}
