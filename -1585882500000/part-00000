However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an \"old woman\" and ''ape'' is the word for \"fire\", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|\u85e4|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|\u8679|niji|but with an alternative reading, ''fuji''}}, and came from its \"long well-shaped slope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306e\u7531\u6765 |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71 \u2013 \u77e5\u6cc9Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |title=\u5730\u540d\u30fb\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u306e\u610f\u5473 |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8a9e\u6e90\u8aac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nModern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /pu\u207fzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese \u706b\u4e3b meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:\u5bcc\u58eb#Etymology 2]].\n\n===Variations===\nIn English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction.

UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hong\u016b Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji|Taisekiji Head Temple]] founded in 1290, later depicted by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist Katsushika [[Hokusai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|\u5bcc}} and {{lang|ja|\u58eb}}, mean \"wealth\" or \"abundant\" and \"a man of status\" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.\n\nThe origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|\"immortal\"|\u4e0d\u6b7b|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|\u5bcc|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|\u58eb|shi, ji}}<ref>Although the word {{lang|ja|\u58eb}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|\u5175\u58eb|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|\u6b66\u58eb|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.</ref> ascending the slopes of the mountain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}</ref> An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u4e8c}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|\u4e0d\u5c3d}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.\n\nA Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, \"a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|\u7a42|ho}} of a rice plant\". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854\u20131944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for \"fire\" (''fuchi'') of the [[fire deity]] ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi]] (1882\u20131971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]).

After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location. These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago. Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried. A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago. Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago. Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707. The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit. Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 [[lava tunnel]]s and extensive lava tree molds. Two large [[landslide]]s are at the head of the Yoshida-Osawa and Osawa-Kuzure valleys.<ref name=Piotr/>\n\n{{As of|2002|12}}, the volcano is classified as active with a low risk of eruption. The last recorded eruption was the [[H\u014dei eruption of Mount Fuji|H\u014dei eruption]] which started on December 16, 1707 (''[[H\u014dei]] 4, 23rd day of the 11th month''), and ended about January 1, 1708 (''H\u014dei 4, 9th day of the 12th month''), during the [[Edo period]].<ref name=\"ShizuokaUni\">{{cite web | url=http://sk01.ed.shizuoka.ac.jp/koyama/public_html/Fuji/fujid/1707.html | title=\u5b9d\u6c38\u56db\u5e74\uff081707\uff09\u5674\u706b (1707 Eruption) | publisher=Shizuoka University | work=\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u6b74\u53f2\u5674\u706b\u7dcf\u89e3\u8aac (Database of eruptions and other activities of Fuji Volcano, Japan, based on historical records since AD 781) | date=March 2007 | accessdate=25 September 2008 | author=Masato Oyama | language=Japanese}}</ref> The eruption formed a new [[Volcanic crater|crater]] and a second peak, named '''[[Mount H\u014dei]]''' (after the [[H\u014dei]] era), halfway down its southeastern side.

In September 2012, mathematical models created by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NRIESDP) suggested that the pressure in Mount Fuji's [[magma chamber]] could be 1.6 [[pascal (unit)|megapascals]] higher than it was before its last eruption in 1707. This was interpreted by some media outlets to mean that an eruption of Mount Fuji could be imminent.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/06/mount-fuji |title=Pressure in Mount Fuji is now higher than last eruption, warn experts | last1=Clark | first1=Liat | magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=September 6, 2012 | access-date=September 6, 2012}}</ref> However, since there is no known method of directly measuring the pressure of a volcano's magma chamber, indirect calculations of the type used by NRIESDP are speculative and unverifiable.

They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,<!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid. --> [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.<ref name=MountainTrails>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}</ref> Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.<!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--> There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.<ref name=MountainTrails />\n\nEven though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.\nBesides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.\n\nThe four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.\n\nHuts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers\u2014Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.\n[[File:\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u9802\u5fa1\u6765\u5149 Go-raikou(The sunrise) at summit of Mt.Fuji HDR-CX560V.webm|thumb|The sunrise seen from the summit of Mount Fuji]]\nThere are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.\n\n===Paragliding===\n[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and H\u014dei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction.
