From there, the trail snaked up the east side of the island.

The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010.

South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].\n\n====Lower Manhattan====\n[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]\n\nThe section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the \"[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]\" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].\n\nBroadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.\n\n====Midtown Manhattan====\n[[File:Bway.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A view of Broadway in 1909]]\n\nBecause Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east\u2013west streets and north\u2013south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by \"[[town square|squares]]\" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].\n\nAt [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.\n\n[[File:Broadway looking north from 48th Street Manhattan.jpeg|thumb|left|Broadway looking north from 48th Street in the Theater District]]\nOne famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[red-light district]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.<ref>Dunlap, David W.

For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.\n\nSeveral notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here.

The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010.

Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road.\n\nIn May 2013, the [[New York City Department of Transportation|NYCDOT]] decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]</ref>\n\nIn spring 2017, as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a \"[[Shared space|shared street]]\" where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}.

South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th]] and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Streets]], and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].\n\n====Lower Manhattan====\n[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]\n\nThe section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the \"[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]\" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the [[Hudson River]] shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca]] and [[Battery Park City]].\n\nBroadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.\n\n====Midtown Manhattan====\n[[File:Bway.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A view of Broadway in 1909]]\n\nBecause Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east\u2013west streets and north\u2013south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by \"[[town square|squares]]\" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].\n\nAt [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.\n\n[[File:Broadway looking north from 48th Street Manhattan.jpeg|thumb|left|Broadway looking north from 48th Street in the Theater District]]\nOne famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area.

In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block.

This does not refer to the wheels of a [[mobile robot]] or the feet of a [[humanoid robot]], which are not end effectors but rather part of a robot's mobility.\n\nEnd effectors may consist of a gripper or a tool. \nWhen referring to robotic prehension there are four general categories of robot grippers:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Monkman |first1=G.

Vacuum cups and electromagnets dominate the automotive field and metal sheet handling. [[Bernoulli grip|Bernoulli grippers]] exploit the airflow between the gripper and the part, in which a lifting force brings the gripper and part close each other (using [[Bernoulli's principle]]). Bernoulli grippers are a type of contactless grippers; the object remains confined in the force field generated by the gripper without coming into direct contact with it. Bernoulli grippers have been adopted in photovoltaic cell handling, [[silicon wafer]] handling, and in the textile and leather industries.\nOther principles are less used at the macro scale (part size >5mm), but in the last ten years, have demonstrated interesting applications in micro-handling. Other adopted principles include: Electrostatic grippers and van der Waals grippers based on electrostatic charges (i.e. [[van der Waals' force]]), capillary grippers and cryogenic grippers, based on a liquid medium, and ultrasonic grippers and laser grippers, two contactless-grasping principles.  \nElectrostatic grippers use a charge-difference between gripper and part ([[electrostatic force]]) often activated by the gripper itself, while van der Waals grippers are based on the low force (still electrostatic) of atomic attraction between the molecules of the gripper and those of the object.\nCapillary grippers use the surface tension of a liquid meniscus between the gripper and the part to center, align and grasp a part. Cryogenic grippers freeze a small amount of liquid, with the resulting ice supplying the necessary force to lift and handle the object (this principle is used also in food handling and in textile grasping). Even more complex are [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] grippers, where pressure [[standing wave]]s are used to lift up a part and trap it at a certain level (example of levitation are both at the micro level, in screw- and gasket-handling, and at the macro scale, in solar cell or silicon-wafer handling), and laser source that produces a pressure sufficient to trap and move microparts in a liquid medium (mainly cells). Laser grippers are known also as [[laser tweezers]].\n\nA particular category of friction/jaw grippers is that of needle grippers. These are called intrusive grippers, exploiting both friction and form-closure as standard mechanical grippers.\n\nThe most known mechanical gripper can be of two, three or even five fingers.\n\nThe end effectors that can be used as tools serve various purposes, including spot-welding in an assembly, spray-painting where uniformity of painting is necessary, and other purposes where the working conditions are dangerous for human beings. Surgical robots have end effectors that are specifically manufactured for the purpose.\n\n==Gripper mechanism==\nA common form of robotic grasping is [[robotic force closure|force closure]].<ref name=fub20140320>\n{{cite web |title=Robotics Grasping and Force closure |url=http://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/marc/teaching/11-Robotics/11-grasping.pdf |work=pdf |publisher=FU Berlin |accessdate=2014-03-20 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><!-- there appears to be no WP article on force closure so leaving a link to source the concept. -->\n\nGenerally, the gripping mechanism is done by the grippers or mechanical fingers. Two-finger grippers tend to be  used for industrial robots performing specific tasks in less-complex applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The fingers are replaceable.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nTwo types of mechanisms used in two-finger gripping account for the shape of the surface to be gripped, and the force required to grip the object.\n\nThe shape of the fingers' gripping surface can be chosen according to the shape of the objects to be manipulated. For example, if a robot is designed to lift a round object, the gripper surface shape can be a concave impression of it to make the grip efficient. For a square shape, the surface can be a plane.\n\n=== Force required to grip an object ===\nThough there are numerous forces acting over the body that has been lifted by a robotic arm, the main force is the frictional force. The gripping surface can be made of a soft material with high coefficient of friction so that the surface of the object is not damaged. The robotic gripper must withstand not only the weight of the object but also acceleration and the motion that is caused by frequent movement of the object. To find out the force required to grip the object, the following formula is used\n:<math>F= \\frac{ma}{\\mu n}</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n<dl><dd>\n{|cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| <math>\\,F</math>\n| &nbsp;is&nbsp;\n| the force required to grip the object,\n|-\n| <math>\\,m</math>\n| &nbsp;is&nbsp;\n| the mass of the object,\n|-\n| <math>\\,a</math>\n| &nbsp;is&nbsp;\n| the acceleration of the object,\n|-\n| <math>\\,\\mu</math>\n| &nbsp;is&nbsp;\n| the coeffecient of friction and\n|-\n| <math>\\,n</math>\n| &nbsp;is&nbsp;\n| the number of fingers in the gripper.\n|}\n</dd></dl>\n\nA more complete equation would account for the direction of movement. For example, when the body is moved upwards, against gravitational force, the force required will be more than that towards the gravitational force. Hence, another term is introduced and the formula becomes:\n\n:<math>F= \\frac{m(a+g)}{\\mu n}</math>\n\nHere, the value of <math>\\,g</math> should be taken as the acceleration due to gravity and <math>\\,a</math> the acceleration due to movement.\n\nFor many physically interactive manipulation tasks, such as writing and handling a screwdriver, a task-related grasp criterion can be applied in order to choose grasps that are most appropriate to meeting specific task requirements.

The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but the only sections that can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government are the Second Section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], known also as the Section for Relations with States, the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]] (established in 1939 by [[Pius XII]]), and the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]], \n\nIt is normal for every Latin Catholic [[diocese]] to have its own ''curia'' for its administration. For the [[Diocese of Rome]], these functions are ''not'' handled by the Roman Curia, but by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome]], as provided by the apostolic constitution ''[[Ecclesia in Urbe]]''. The pope has, going back to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], been the bishop of Rome. There is also the The [[Vicar General of Rome]], traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the [[Vicar General for Vatican City]], administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in [[Vatican City]].\n\nUntil recently, there still existed [[hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the [[Papal States]] were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by [[Pope Pius X]], was incorporated into the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507667/Roman-Curia |title=Roman Curia (Roman Catholicism) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the [[Holy See]].

The Secretariat of State was created in the 15th century<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_12101998_profile_en.htm]</ref> and is now the department of the curia most involved in coordinating the Holy See's activities.

The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but the only sections that can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government are the Second Section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], known also as the Section for Relations with States, the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]] (established in 1939 by [[Pius XII]]), and the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]], \n\nIt is normal for every Latin Catholic [[diocese]] to have its own ''curia'' for its administration. For the [[Diocese of Rome]], these functions are ''not'' handled by the Roman Curia, but by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome]], as provided by the apostolic constitution ''[[Ecclesia in Urbe]]''. The pope has, going back to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], been the bishop of Rome. There is also the The [[Vicar General of Rome]], traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the [[Vicar General for Vatican City]], administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in [[Vatican City]].\n\nUntil recently, there still existed [[hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the [[Papal States]] were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by [[Pope Pius X]], was incorporated into the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507667/Roman-Curia |title=Roman Curia (Roman Catholicism) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the [[Holy See]].

By 10:01, the aircraft had reached its cruising altitude of around {{convert|37000|ft}} and was maintaining a cruising speed of Mach&nbsp;0.82.\n\nThe incident started at 12:40:26 [[Time in Australia|WST]], when one of the aircraft's three [[air data inertial reference unit]]s (ADIRUs) started providing incorrect data to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the [[autopilot]] disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft's [[Electronic centralised aircraft monitor|ECAM]], warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial reference systems, and audible stall and overspeed warnings. During this time, the captain began to manually control the aircraft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15&nbsp;seconds and would remain disengaged for the remainder of the flight. \n\nAt 12:42:27, the aircraft made a sudden, uncommanded pitch down manoeuvre, experiencing \u20130.8&nbsp;''g'',<ref group=note>\"Normal\" ''g''-force (i.e. the force on an object due to the gravity of the Earth, if that object is on or near the surface of the Earth, and that object is not subject to other forces) is +1.0&nbsp;''g''. As an aircraft is accelerated downward (for example, as in this case, by a sudden, uncommanded pitch-down), the ''g''-force may decrease to 0 (zero), at which point weightlessness is experienced; if the downward acceleration is greater yet, the ''g''-force becomes negative. In the case of Qantas Flight 72, a ''g''-force of nearly one full negative ''g'' was experienced; from the in-cabin frame of reference, it can be thought of as if gravity had nearly completely \"reversed\", and anything not restrained \"fell upwards\".</ref> reaching 8.4&nbsp;degrees pitch down and rapidly descending {{convert|650|ft}}. Twenty seconds later, the pilots were able to return the aircraft to the assigned cruise flight level, [[flight level|FL370]].

The aircraft was fitted with three ADIRUs to provide redundancy for fault tolerance, and the FCPCs used the three independent AOA values to check their consistency. In the usual case, when all three AOA values were valid and consistent, the average value of AOA 1 and AOA 2 was used by the FCPCs for their computations. If either AOA 1 or AOA 2 significantly deviated from the other two values, the FCPCs used a memorised value for 1.2 seconds. The FCPC algorithm was very effective, but it could not correctly manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in either AOA 1 or AOA 2 that were 1.2 seconds apart.\n\nAs with other safety-critical systems, the development of the A330/A340 flight control system during 1991 and 1992 had many elements to minimise the risk of a design error. These included peer reviews, a system safety assessment (SSA), and testing and simulations to verify and validate the system requirements. None of these activities identified the design limitation in the FCPC's AOA algorithm.\n\nThe ADIRU failure mode had not been previously encountered, or identified by the ADIRU manufacturer in its safety analysis activities. Overall, the design, verification and validation processes used by the aircraft manufacturer did not fully consider the potential effects of frequent spikes in data from an ADIRU.\n\nAirbus has stated that it is not aware of a similar incident occurring previously on an Airbus aircraft.  Airbus has released an Operators Information [[Telex]] to operators of [[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]] aircraft with procedural recommendations and checklists to minimise risk in the event of a similar incident.<ref name=\"ATSB_MR_20081014\" />\n\n==Final report==\n===Analysis===\nAfter detailed forensic analysis of the FDR, the FCPC software, and the ADIRU, it was determined that the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature of the corruption was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously [[ARINC_429#Labels|re-labelled]] the altitude [[ARINC_429#Word_format|data word]] so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude at the time of the incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the [[Flight_control_modes#Flight_mode|high-AOA]] protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/3532398/ao2008070.pdf|title=In-flight upset - 154 km west of Learmonth, WA, 7 October 2008, VH-QPA, Airbus A330-303,|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Aviation Safety Investigation Report&nbsp;\u2013 Final|publisher=Australian Transport Safety Bureau|id=AO-2008-070|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Potential trigger types===\nA number of potential trigger types were investigated, including software bugs, software corruption, hardware faults, electromagnetic interference and the secondary high energy particles generated by [[Cosmic_ray#Secondary_cosmic_rays|cosmic rays]]. Although a definitive conclusion could not be reached, there was sufficient information from multiple sources to conclude that most of the potential triggers were very unlikely to have been involved. A much more likely scenario was that a marginal hardware weakness of some form made the units susceptible to the effects of some type of environmental factor, which triggered the failure mode.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\nThe ATSB assessment of speculation that possible interference from [[Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt]] or passenger personal electronic devices could have been involved was 'extremely unlikely'.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe ATSB's final report, issued on 19 December 2011, concluded that the incident \" occurred due to the combination of a design \nlimitation in the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software of the Airbus \nA330/A340, and a failure mode affecting one of the aircraft\u2019s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs). The design limitation meant that, in a very rare and specific situation, multiple spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data from one of the ADIRUs could result in the FCPCs commanding the aircraft to pitch down.\"<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Subsequent Qantas Flight 71 incident===\n{{Main|Air data inertial reference unit#Failures and directives}}\nOn 27 December 2008, a Qantas A330-300 aircraft operating from Perth to Singapore was involved in an occurrence approximately {{convert|260|NM|km}} north-west of Perth and {{convert|350|NM|km}} south of Learmonth Airport at 1729 WST, while flying at [[flight level|FL360]].

During this time, the captain began to manually control the aircraft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15&nbsp;seconds and would remain disengaged for the remainder of the flight. \n\nAt 12:42:27, the aircraft made a sudden, uncommanded pitch down manoeuvre, experiencing \u20130.8&nbsp;''g'',<ref group=note>\"Normal\" ''g''-force (i.e. the force on an object due to the gravity of the Earth, if that object is on or near the surface of the Earth, and that object is not subject to other forces) is +1.0&nbsp;''g''.

The aircraft was fitted with three ADIRUs to provide redundancy for fault tolerance, and the FCPCs used the three independent AOA values to check their consistency. In the usual case, when all three AOA values were valid and consistent, the average value of AOA 1 and AOA 2 was used by the FCPCs for their computations. If either AOA 1 or AOA 2 significantly deviated from the other two values, the FCPCs used a memorised value for 1.2 seconds. The FCPC algorithm was very effective, but it could not correctly manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in either AOA 1 or AOA 2 that were 1.2 seconds apart.\n\nAs with other safety-critical systems, the development of the A330/A340 flight control system during 1991 and 1992 had many elements to minimise the risk of a design error. These included peer reviews, a system safety assessment (SSA), and testing and simulations to verify and validate the system requirements. None of these activities identified the design limitation in the FCPC\u2019s AOA algorithm.\n\nThe ADIRU failure mode had not been previously encountered, or identified by the ADIRU manufacturer in its safety analysis activities. Overall, the design, verification and validation processes used by the aircraft manufacturer did not fully consider the potential effects of frequent spikes in data from an ADIRU.\n\nAirbus has stated that it is not aware of a similar incident occurring previously on an Airbus aircraft.  Airbus has released an Operators Information [[Telex]] to operators of [[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]] aircraft with procedural recommendations and checklists to minimise risk in the event of a similar incident.<ref name=\"ATSB_MR_20081014\" />\n\n==Final report==\n===Analysis===\nAfter detailed forensic analysis of the FDR, the FCPC software, and the ADIRU, it was determined that the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature of the corruption was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously [[ARINC_429#Labels|re-labelled]] the altitude [[ARINC_429#Word_format|data word]] so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude at the time of the incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the [[Flight_control_modes#Flight_mode|high-AOA]] protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/3532398/ao2008070.pdf|title=In-flight upset - 154 km west of Learmonth, WA, 7 October 2008, VH-QPA, Airbus A330-303,|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Aviation Safety Investigation Report&nbsp;\u2013 Final|publisher=Australian Transport Safety Bureau|id=AO-2008-070|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Potential trigger types===\nA number of potential trigger types were investigated, including software bugs, software corruption, hardware faults, electromagnetic interference and the secondary high energy particles generated by [[Cosmic_ray#Secondary_cosmic_rays|cosmic rays]]. Although a definitive conclusion could not be reached, there was sufficient information from multiple sources to conclude that most of the potential triggers were very unlikely to have been involved. A much more likely scenario was that a marginal hardware weakness of some form made the units susceptible to the effects of some type of environmental factor, which triggered the failure mode.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\nThe ATSB assessment of speculation that possible interference from [[Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt]] or passenger personal electronic devices could have been involved was 'extremely unlikely'.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe ATSB's final report, issued on 19 December 2011, concluded that the incident \" occurred due to the combination of a design \nlimitation in the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software of the Airbus \nA330/A340, and a failure mode affecting one of the aircraft\u2019s three air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs). The design limitation meant that, in a very rare and specific situation, multiple spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data from one of the ADIRUs could result in the FCPCs commanding the aircraft to pitch down.\"<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Subsequent Qantas Flight 71 incident===\n{{Main|Air data inertial reference unit#Failures and directives}}\nOn 27 December 2008, a Qantas A330-300 aircraft operating from Perth to Singapore was involved in an occurrence approximately {{convert|260|NM|km}} north-west of Perth and {{convert|350|NM|km}} south of Learmonth Airport at 1729 WST, while flying at [[flight level|FL360]].
