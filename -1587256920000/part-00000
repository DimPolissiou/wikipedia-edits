On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs.

The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.\n\nWhen suspicious, a Kangal Shepherd Dog will stand with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal Shepherd Dog's first instinct is to place itself between the perceived threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal Shepherd Dog confronts the intruder.

This combination of coat allows it to regulate its core temperature more efficiently, while the coat is dense enough to repel rupture from wolf bites.<ref name=\"Kangalbreed\"/>\nFurther differences between the KIF standard and those used internationally are found in the guidelines for coat and colour. The registered Kangal Shepherd Dog organizations in Turkey, Cynology Federation Of Turkey (KIF)\u2014to an extent\u2014and Ankara Kangal Derne\u011fi (ANKADER) do not regard coat colour as a breed defining feature. Brindle, recessive black tan pattern, white markings and a longer coat are regarded as Kangal and are not usually indicative of cross breeding, as the KIF standard as significant restrictions on accepted color and is more restrictive with respect to white markings than any of the other international standards, as white markings are only accepted on the chest and on the tip of the tail, whereas standards from other kennel clubs allow white markings on the feet and legs. Rather it is head structure and morphology that differentiate Kangal from other \u00c7oban K\u00f6pegi.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn contrast other kennel clubs describe coat and colour as perhaps the most visible traits that distinguish the Kangal from the [[Akbash dog|Akbash]] and [[Anatolian Shepherd Dog|Anatolian]]. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a pale fawn or tan color with varying amounts of sable guard hairs. All Kangal Shepherd Dogs have a [[Melanistic mask|black facial mask]], and black or shaded ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some heavily sabled Kangals also have darker legs and chests. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken, [[brindle]]d, or spotted. Cropping of the ears is done for several reasons, including the cultural demonstration of ownership vice feral dog, for appearance and for protection, as long ears can be vulnerable in a physical confrontation with a predator.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The cropping of ears is illegal in the UK.\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishKangal.jpg|A Kangal with cropped ears\nFile:Kangal dog puppy eating yoghurt.jpg|Kangal dog puppy eating yogurt\nFile:Kangal-welpen-de 010.jpg|The Kangal dog can be a good house dog if effectively trained from birth\nFile:Cobra-BlackMamba 2.jpg\nKral jrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\nThe Kangal Shepherd Dog is calm, controlled, independent, powerful and protective. They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized [https://www.allaboutdogs.net/kangal-dog/ Kangal Dog] is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never be shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal Shepherd Dog is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, but they may not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.\n\n=== Protective behavior ===\n[[File:Kangal dog with spikey collar, Turkey.jpg|thumb|Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty]]\nA working Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty will station itself on a high vantage point overlooking its flock. On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs. The dogs will work in pairs or teams depending on the size of the flock, taking up positions around the sheep and changing their positions as needed. The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.\n\nWhen suspicious, a Kangal Shepherd Dog will stand with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal Shepherd Dog's first instinct is to place itself between the perceived threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal Shepherd Dog confronts the intruder. When faced with a [[wolf]], the Kangal Shepherd Dog sometimes is successful in intimidating the enemy, but it will resort to a physical confrontation if the predator stands its ground.<ref name=\"Kangalbreed\"/> Specialized wolf killers are known as \"kurt\u00e7ul kangal\" in their homeland.\n\n== Kangal/Anatolian Shepherd ==\nThe UK Kennel Club announced it will recognise the Kangal Shepherd Dog as a breed with effect from July 2013.

During his reign he reformed the metropolitan administration of the Church of the East, granting greater independence to the [[metropolitan bishop]]s of the mission field (the 'exterior' provinces) but excluding them from participation in patriarchal elections.  These reforms laid the foundations for the later success of Church of the East missions in [[Central Asia]].\n\n== Early life and succession to the patriarchate ==\nTimothy was a native of \u1e24azza in [[Adiabene]],<ref>David D. Bundy, [https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Timotheos-I \"Timotheos I\"], in ''Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac Heritage: Electronic Edition'', edited by Sebastian P. Brock, Aaron M.

He later became bishop of the diocese of Beth Bgash, in the [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitan province of Adiabene]], winning the respect of Abu Musa ibn Mus{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}ab, the Moslem governor of Mosul, and his Christian secretary Abu Nuh al-Anbari.  On the death of the patriarch [[Hnanisho II|Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II]] in 778, Timothy used a judicious mixture of bribery{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, deceit{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and (probably) murder{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} to secure his own election as patriarch. One rival for the post was the elderly Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}yahb, the superior of the monastery of Beth {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abe, and Timothy first frightened{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} him by advising him that he might not be fit enough to survive the intrigues of high office, but honored him by offering him the position of metropolitan of [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Adiabene]].  A second potential rival, Giwargis, was nominated at a synod convened by the bishop Thomas of Kashkar in the monastery of Mar Pethion in Baghdad.  Giwargis enjoyed the support of the caliph [[al-Mahdi]]'s Christian doctor {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Isa ibn Quraysh, and might have been a serious threat to Timothy had he not died suddenly in suspicious{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} circumstances.  Timothy then secured a majority in the subsequent ballot by promising to reward his supporters handsomely.  After he was elected, he did nothing of the sort.  Those who complained were told, 'The priesthood is not sold for money.'<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'' (ed Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 168\u201370</ref>\n\nThese tactics were not forgotten by his opponents, and an opposition party led by the metropolitan Joseph of Merv held a synod in the monastery of Beth Hale, in which they excommunicated Timothy and replaced Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}yahb as metropolitan of Adiabene by Rustam, bishop of Hnitha.  Timothy retorted with the same weapon and deposed Joseph of Merv, who, failing to find redress from the caliph al-Mahdi, converted to Islam.  Further rounds of excommunications led to rioting in the streets of Baghdad by the city's Christians.  The opposition to Timothy was finally stilled by the intervention of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Isa ibn Quraysh.<ref>Wright, ''A Short History of Syriac Literature'', 191\u20133</ref>\n\n== Literary achievement ==\nTimothy was a respected writer of scientific, theological, liturgical, and canonical books.  Some 59 of his letters survive, covering roughly the first half of his patriarchate.  The letters discuss varied biblical and theological questions as well as revealing much about the situation of the church in his day.  One letter records him ordaining bishops for the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of Central Asia, for [[Tibet]], for Shiharzur, Radan, [[Ray, Iran]], Gurgan, Balad, and several other places.  The letters also show a wide familiarity with literature from across the ancient Christian world.  Because he moved to Baghdad after his election as patriarch, he was familiar with the [[Abbasid]] court and assisted in the translation of works by Aristotle and others.\n\nOne of Timothy's most famous literary productions was the record of an inconclusive debate on the rival claims of Christianity and Islam,  supposedly held in 782 with the third [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Mahdi]] (reigned 775\u201385).  The debate, which some{{who|date=October 2014}} argue was a literary fiction, offers a somewhat unorganized back-and-forth that lends credence to the argument that the debate took place and was recorded by Timothy himself.<ref>Clint Hackenburg, \"An Arabic-to-English Translation of the Religious Debate between the Nestorian Patriarch Timothy I and the \u2018Abb\u0101sid Caliph al-Mahdi\" (M.A. thesis, Ohio State University, 2009), 32.</ref>  It was published first in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and later in Arabic.  In its surviving form, in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], it is noticeably respectful towards Islam, and may well have been written for the enjoyment of both Christian and Muslim readers.  The debate was translated into English in 1928 by [[Alphonse Mingana]], under the title 'Timothy's Apology for Christianity'.  Its theme is of perennial interest, and it can still be read today both for pleasure and profit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mingana|first=Alfonse|title=Timothy I, Apology for Christianity (1928) pp.v-vii, 1\u201315|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/timothy_i_apology_00_intro.htm|publisher=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Interest in missionary expansion ==\nTimothy took a particularly keen interest in the missionary expansion of the Church of the East.  He is known to have consecrated metropolitans for [[Damascus]], for [[Armenia (East Syrian Diocese)|Armenia]], for [[Dailam]] and [[Gilan]], for [[Rai (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Rai]] in Tabaristan, for Sarbaz in Segestan, for the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of Central Asia, and for China, and he also declared his intention of consecrating a metropolitan for [[Tibet]].<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 47 (Armenia), 72 (Damascus), 74 (Dailam and Gilan), 105 (China), 124 (Rai), 128\u20139 (Sarbaz), 128 (Samarqand and Beth Turkaye) and 139 (Tibet)</ref> Mar [[Shubhalisho\u02bf]], metropolitan of Dailam and Gilan was martyred.<ref>See Timothy's ''Letter 47''.</ref> He also detached India from the metropolitan province of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Fars]] and made it a separate metropolitan province.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 94\u20136</ref> He sent the bishops [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth]] to India who were instrumental in constructing a number of churches for the [[Saint Thomas Christians]].\n\n==Resting place==\nTimothy was buried in [[Baghdad]]'s ''Dayr al-Jathaliq'' (\"[[Catholicos]] Monastery\"), originally ''Dayr\u0101 Klil\u0101 Ishu\u02bf'' ({{lang-syr|\u0715\u071d\u072a\u0710 \u071f\u0720\u071d\u0720\u0710 \u071d\u072b\u0718\u0725}} \"Wreath of [[Yeshua]]/[[Jesus]] monastery\"), which was a monastery of the Church of the East built on the western bank of the [[Tigris]] in the [[Sasanian Empire]]'s province of [[Mesopotamia]], [[As\u014drist\u0101n]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kaldaya.net/2008/articles/300/281_July30_08_Bazi.html|title=\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u062b\u0644\u064a\u0642 \u0623\u0648 \u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0643\u0644\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0634\u0648\u0639|publisher=kaldaya.net|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Abbeloos, J.

He later became bishop of the diocese of Beth Bgash, in the [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|metropolitan province of Adiabene]], winning the respect of Abu Musa ibn Mus{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}ab, the Moslem governor of Mosul, and his Christian secretary Abu Nuh al-Anbari.  On the death of the patriarch [[Hnanisho II|Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}} II]] in 778, Timothy used a judicious mixture of bribery{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, deceit{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and (probably) murder{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} to secure his own election as patriarch. One rival for the post was the elderly Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}yahb, the superior of the monastery of Beth {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Abe, and Timothy first frightened{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} him by advising him that he might not be fit enough to survive the intrigues of high office, but honored him by offering him the position of metropolitan of [[Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Adiabene]].  A second potential rival, Giwargis, was nominated at a synod convened by the bishop Thomas of Kashkar in the monastery of Mar Pethion in Baghdad.  Giwargis enjoyed the support of the caliph [[al-Mahdi]]'s Christian doctor {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Isa ibn Quraysh, and might have been a serious threat to Timothy had he not died suddenly in suspicious{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} circumstances.  Timothy then secured a majority in the subsequent ballot by promising to reward his supporters handsomely.  After he was elected, he did nothing of the sort.  Those who complained were told, 'The priesthood is not sold for money.'<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'' (ed Abeloos and Lamy), ii. 168\u201370</ref>\n\nThese tactics were not forgotten by his opponents, and an opposition party led by the metropolitan Joseph of Merv held a synod in the monastery of Beth Hale, in which they excommunicated Timothy and replaced Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}yahb as metropolitan of Adiabene by Rustam, bishop of Hnitha.  Timothy retorted with the same weapon and deposed Joseph of Merv, who, failing to find redress from the caliph al-Mahdi, converted to Islam.  Further rounds of excommunications led to rioting in the streets of Baghdad by the city's Christians.  The opposition to Timothy was finally stilled by the intervention of {{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}Isa ibn Quraysh.<ref>Wright, ''A Short History of Syriac Literature'', 191\u20133</ref>\n\n== Literary achievement ==\nTimothy was a respected writer of scientific, theological, liturgical, and canonical books.  Some 59 of his letters survive, covering roughly the first half of his patriarchate.  The letters discuss varied biblical and theological questions as well as revealing much about the situation of the church in his day.  One letter records him ordaining bishops for the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of Central Asia, for [[Tibet]], for Shiharzur, Radan, [[Ray, Iran]], Gurgan, Balad, and several other places.  The letters also show a wide familiarity with literature from across the ancient Christian world.  Because he moved to Baghdad after his election as patriarch, he was familiar with the [[Abbasid]] court and assisted in the translation of works by Aristotle and others.\n\nOne of Timothy's most famous literary productions was the record of an inconclusive debate on the rival claims of Christianity and Islam,  supposedly held in 782 with the third [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Mahdi]] (reigned 775\u201385).  The debate, which some{{who|date=October 2014}} argue was a literary fiction, offers a somewhat unorganized back-and-forth that lends credence to the argument that the debate took place and was recorded by Timothy himself.<ref>Clint Hackenburg, \"An Arabic-to-English Translation of the Religious Debate between the Nestorian Patriarch Timothy I and the \u2018Abb\u0101sid Caliph al-Mahdi\" (M.A. thesis, Ohio State University, 2009), 32.</ref>  It was published first in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and later in Arabic.  In its surviving form, in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], it is noticeably respectful towards Islam, and may well have been written for the enjoyment of both Christian and Muslim readers.  The debate was translated into English in 1928 by [[Alphonse Mingana]], under the title 'Timothy's Apology for Christianity'.  Its theme is of perennial interest, and it can still be read today both for pleasure and profit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mingana|first=Alfonse|title=Timothy I, Apology for Christianity (1928) pp.v-vii, 1\u201315|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/timothy_i_apology_00_intro.htm|publisher=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Interest in missionary expansion ==\nTimothy took a particularly keen interest in the missionary expansion of the Church of the East.  He is known to have consecrated metropolitans for [[Damascus]], for [[Armenia (East Syrian Diocese)|Armenia]], for Dailam and [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] in Azerbaijan, for [[Rai (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Rai]] in Tabaristan, for Sarbaz in Segestan, for the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] of Central Asia, and for China, and he also declared his intention of consecrating a metropolitan for [[Tibet]].<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 47 (Armenia), 72 (Damascus), 74 (Dailam and Gilan), 105 (China), 124 (Rai), 128\u20139 (Sarbaz), 128 (Samarqand and Beth Turkaye) and 139 (Tibet)</ref>  He also detached India from the metropolitan province of [[Fars (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Fars]] and made it a separate metropolitan province.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 94\u20136</ref> He sent the bishops [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth]] to India who were instrumental in constructing a number of churches for the [[Saint Thomas Christians]].\n\n==Resting place==\nTimothy was buried in [[Baghdad]]'s ''Dayr al-Jathaliq'' (\"[[Catholicos]] Monastery\"), originally ''Dayr\u0101 Klil\u0101 Ishu\u02bf'' ({{lang-syr|\u0715\u071d\u072a\u0710 \u071f\u0720\u071d\u0720\u0710 \u071d\u072b\u0718\u0725}} \"Wreath of [[Yeshua]]/[[Jesus]] monastery\"), which was a monastery of the Church of the East built on the western bank of the [[Tigris]] in the [[Sasanian Empire]]'s province of [[Mesopotamia]], [[As\u014drist\u0101n]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kaldaya.net/2008/articles/300/281_July30_08_Bazi.html|title=\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u062b\u0644\u064a\u0642 \u0623\u0648 \u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0643\u0644\u064a\u0644\u064a\u0634\u0648\u0639|publisher=kaldaya.net|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Abbeloos, J.
