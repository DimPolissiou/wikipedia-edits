The episode was written by [[Elizabeth Finch]] and directed by [[Debbie Allen]]. It marked the final appearance of [[Justin Chambers]] as [[Alex Karev]].\n\nOn January 10, 2020, it was announced that Chambers left the series, having already made his last physical appearance in the November 14, 2019 episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep350|My Shot]]\", the 350th episode revolving around the trial for Meredith's medical license.<ref name=\"last\">{{Cite web|url= https://deadline.com/2020/01/justin-chambers-leaving-greys-anatomy-exit-15-years-16-seasons-alex-karev-abc-1202826876/|title=Justin Chambers Leaving Grey\u2019s Anatomy After 15 Years|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 10, 2020|access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref> Showrunner [[Krista Vernoff]] discussed the challenge in writing Alex off without Chambers physically being there, having left the show suddenly. Vernoff said, \"It was a very careful threading of a needle, where we are giving a little bit of information and pain to Jo,\" she said, adding, \"We\u2019re, episode by episode, illuminating the story of where Alex is. And it takes us quite a few more episodes to get there and to give the audience clarity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2020/03/05/greys-anatomy-alex-izzie-season-16-interview/|title=Grey's Boss Speaks Out in Wake of Shocking Alex Farewell Episode|work=TVLine|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=March 5, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode resolves several storylines, including the disappearance of Alex Karev after seven episodes, the disappearance of [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) over ten years ago and [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) choosing to take in a homeless teenager. Stevens was last seen in the episode, \"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\" in 2010, and appears for the first time again in archive footage, as details of her current situation are revealed, along with Chambers' character. Chambers returns for the episode in voice-over, as the episode takes a retrospective approach, as he narrates much of what has happened to him since.\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 6.30 million viewers and registered the show's best ratings in six weeks, since the mid-season premiere. It received a polarizing response from fans and critics alike, who were divided on the show's handling of Alex's exit, but many largely felt it made sense given the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with archive footage of [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]])'s speech to the original interns in the pilot episode. It features [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]). Meredith Grey then provides her signature episodic [[voice-over]], telling a \"lame joke\" about a patient saying, \"Hey doc, it hurts when I go like this\" to which the doctor responds, \"Well don't go like this\" and says that while lame, \"it is nonetheless true that as human beings, we cannot help but want to follow our own instincts, guts and primal urges no matter how much it hurts\". A sequence follows, showing [[Jo Karev]] ([[Camilla Luddington]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) and Meredith Grey (Pompeo) receiving letters from Alex Karev (Chambers). As the three begin reading the letters, Alex (Chambers) provides voice-over of his written letters, declaring that he's not leaving, but has already left \u2015 he is gone.\n\nThe episode then provides a retrospective of landmark storylines in the series integral to Alex's whole journey, from his arrogant, smart-mouth days in the early seasons to his maturation as a successful pediatrics surgeon, devoted friend and partner to Izzie and later Jo. It also shows flashbacks of his relationship with Izzie, her cancer battle and their wedding. It also shows flashbacks of the original five interns' friendship and Meredith's growing friendship with Alex throughout all sixteen seasons. Alex explains to Meredith that the form of a letter was not the way he wanted to say goodbye. He tells Meredith that she was always the one to set him straight, and it provides flashbacks to Alex having to face up to his problems, rather than run away. Alex then says he does not want to be set straight, or for Meredith to say the right thing, because the one right thing isn't in Seattle. Alex then reveals he is with Izzie (Katherine Heigl).\n\nFollowing this revelation, flashbacks of Alex and Izzie's early relationship is shown. As this goes on, Alex reveals he contacted her during Meredith's trial to maintain her medical license for a recommendation letter. He admits the trial gave him an excuse to finally contact Izzie, to know if she was alive and well. After brief exchange on the phone, Alex says he heard little voices in the background and asked if Izzie had kids and after a silence, she revealed that she did. And it turns out they are his children.\n\n[[File:Alex16x08final.png|thumb|225px|right|[[Alex Karev]]'s ([[Justin Chambers]]) last physical appearance includes this scene in the 350th episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep350|My Shot]]\".<ref name=\"last\" />]]\n\nAlex reveals Izzie was single, wanted kids and because the cancer nuked her eggs, she could not have biological children but she had their embryos. Flashbacks from the fifth season show Alex and Izzie's scenes revolving around the embryos. Alex explains he was too freaked out to care what she did with them so he signed papers off so that she could do whatever she wanted with them, as a flashback to Alex's worries of her surviving cancer is shown. He says he is aware he should have told Jo and Meredith, but instead of telling them, he got through the trial and went to see his children. His children \u2015 twins named Alexis and Eli \u2015 are described as \"hilarious and stubborn\" like Izzie, Alexis having Izzie's eyes and Eli's smile being crooked like his, that the kids want to be doctors and they bake like Izzie, and that he lives on a farm in the middle of no-where in Kansas. He also reveals Izzie works as a surgical oncologist and has made so much progress. Alex again says she could come up and bring him back to Seattle, but he hopes she does not do that and that he is finally where he should be, and that he has never had that before. Alex says he hopes when she is ready and not mad that she can come up and meet his children.\n\nFlashbacks also show Jo and Alex's relationship, as well as Jo's own journey briefly, as Jo reads her letter from him. Alex details how deeply sorry he is, but that he is in love with Izzie as well. Alex admits the letter is the worst thing he is done, and that Jo has earned so much better, but also mentions the children he has with her. Alex tells Jo he felt he and Izzie had unfinished business and that they spoke as if no time had passed, that they were frozen in time. Alex says he needs to give the children the life he and Jo never had. Alex reveals he went to a lawyer, signed divorce papers and left her his shares at Grey Sloan.\n\nWebber, at an AA meeting, relates Alex's situation with Jo and Izzie to Ellis and Adele, and that he wishes he got to see [[Maggie Pierce]] ([[Kelly McCreary]]) grow up, so he cannot be mad at him no matter how hard he wants to be, although admits his bitterness that he could not say goodbye simply as a teacher. It finally shows another sequence of Izzie and Alex's relationship, this time through dialogue of Izzie's declarations of love and finally shows the resemblance of Izzie's children to her.\n\nBailey talks to Ben ([[Jason George]]) about Joey, and relates the situation to Alex's upbringing. They decide to keep caring for him. Meanwhile, Jo swallows her emotions and decides to continue to work casually after reading the letter as Link ([[Chris Carmack]]) calls her his hero. Jo responds, \"Mine too\". The episode ends with Meredith talking to her daughter, Zola (Aniela Gumbs) and preparing to tell her that Uncle Alex is gone, with a voice-over of Meredith to say there really is no good way to say goodbye.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by [[Elisabeth Finch]] and directed by [[Debbie Allen]]. Several former characters appear in the episode through archive footage such as [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), Shane Ross ([[Gaius Charles]]), [[Stephanie Edwards (Grey's Anatomy)|Stephanie Edwards]] ([[Jerrika Hinton]]), [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), Helen Karev ([[Lindsay Wagner]]) and Jimmy Evans ([[James Remar]]). The only current main cast members that appeared in new scenes were [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]), [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]), Jo Karev ([[Camilla Luddington]]) and Atticus \"Link\" Lincoln ([[Chris Carmack]]).\n\nThe episode re-visits [[Katherine Heigl]]'s character, [[Izzie Stevens]], for the first time in over ten years. Alex and Izzie's storyline was left unresolved in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|sixth season]], after Heigl departed the series abruptly during her maternity leave. In a [[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|January 2010 episode]], Stevens leaves after she is unable to repair things with Alex. [[Joan Rater]], the episode's writer, explained that Stevens getting better propelled Karev to let her go.<ref name=Matter>{{cite web|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |title=Joan Rater on \"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked\"... |publisher=ABC |work=Grey Matter |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2012 |author=Rater, Joan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155822/http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |archive-date=May 13, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Izzie's absence after this was intended to be temporary, with the character returning in the season's final five episodes. However, Heigl did not show up for filming on March 1, 2010 for the season's twentieth episode. Heigl's three month family leave in Utah propelled her to quit the show entirely, feeling she needed more time to bond with her adoptive daughter. She explained, \"So before I was due back, I spoke again to [[Shonda Rhimes|Shonda]] about wanting to leave. Then I waited at home until I was given the formal okay that I was off the show. The rumors that I refused to return were totally untrue.\" While Heigl felt the departure was \u201camicable\u201d, despite the shock and feeling that something could have worked out, Heigl felt Izzie returning only to leave again after already having done so twice would \"feel a little manipulative\" and she felt that she had not created a bond with her adoptive daughter yet that made her feel like she needed her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/03/24/katherine-heigl-greys-anatomy-official-ew/|title=This week's cover (exclusive!): Katherine Heigl confirms 'Grey's Anatomy' departure|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|date=March 24, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Alex and Izzie's arc had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"Closure\">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/08/22/greys-anatomy-closure-for-alex-izzie/|title='Grey's Anatomy' Exclusive: Closure is coming for Alex/Izzie fans |first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure.

Then Fremont elaborated, \"It just felt like Alex dying, although tragic, would\u2019ve been the only way to write the character off that made sense after everything he went through\" and that \"Alex Karev we\u2019ve watched for \u2014 holy hell, almost two decades if we\u2019re rounding up \u2014 wouldn\u2019t do that\" although admitted the exit \"almost works\", as Alex chooses to not miss a second with his children and to be a great dad, but that \"Alex not being mad for one single second about the fact that Izzie had secret kids five years ago and never told him\" made \"less sense\". Fremont also noted that Alex could have asked Jo to move to Kansas to help him be there for his children so that it was obviously \"ALSO about the women he loves\". She discussed the dramatic nature of Richard's speech saying, \"I\u2019m sorry, Richard\u2019s speech is lovely and all, but he\u2019s acting like he can\u2019t just go to Kansas and see the guy. Richard thrives on that drama, you guys. Fremont also commented on Jo's reaction saying, \"Poor Jo! And poor me for having to sympathize with a character I can\u2019t stand, you know? Jo\u2019s letter truly sucks\", with both commenting on the impersonal nature of the letter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/greys-anatomy-recap-season-16-episode-16-leave-a-light-on.html|title=Grey\u2019s Anatomy Recap: A Dear Jo Letter|work=Vulture|last=Fremont|first=Maggie|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAshley Bissette Sumerel for ''Telltale-TV'' gave a moderately positive 3.5 out of 5 star review of the episode. She complimented how the writers worked with the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure feeling \"[his] sudden exit meant the writers needed to change course and figure out the best way to write out his character, and I believe they did that, with a few exceptions\" and said, I\u2019d actually told a few people that there was one ending for Alex that I felt like I\u2019d be able to accept, and low and behold, this is it.

She opined that the Izzie/Alex flashbacks \"bothered\" her. She finished saying, \"It worries me that this might mean the whole issue will largely be swept under the rug after this episode.

They noted Meredith as being \"self-absorbed\" saying, \"Meredith has been so far removed from the missing Alex storyline, and before that, she hasn't so much as visited him at Pac-North. Alex's final season had a startling lack of Merlex, so the final goodbye was even bitterer\", while also acknowledging how no goodbye, short of death, would satisfy everyone. The reviewer criticized Alex's development in the episode saying, \"Alex, who has spent years resenting people for abandoning him turned around and left those he loves. It's a struggle to wrap one's head around it.\" Blu also criticized Alex for seemingly using his sick mother as an alibi, and noted it as being uncharacteristic of the \"straight-shooter\" and \"guy who tells it like it is whether you like it or not\" that fans know him by. The reviewer also noted that it was \"already a disservice that it took so long for anyone to pay attention to his absence\" and that \"Jo probably should've contacted his mother ages ago\". Blu also criticized the storyline for how it will service Jo as a tragedy later, calling \"Woe is Joe hours [...] irritating\" and that \"so much of Alex's storylines in the last few seasons have been playing second to Jo.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2020/03/when-good-characters-cant-break-away-from-being-love-interests-w/|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 16 Episode 16 Review: Leave a Light On|work=TVFanatic|last=Blu|first=Jasmine|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Grey's Anatomy episodes|16}}\n\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 16) episodes]]\n[[Category:2020 American television episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE: Leave a Light On (''Grey's Anatomy'')}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n|title = Leave a Light On\n|series = [[Grey's Anatomy]]\n|image =\n|image_size = 250px\n|caption = Meredith reads the letter that Alex sent her.\n|season = 16\n|episode = 16\n|length = 43 minutes\n|airdate = {{start date|2020|3|05}}\n|music = \n|writer = [[Elisabeth Finch]]\n|director = [[Debbie Allen]]\n|guests = * [[Jason George]] as Dr. Ben Warren\n*BJ Tanner as William George Bailey Jones\n| season_article = Grey's Anatomy (season 16)\n| episode_list = List of Grey's Anatomy episodes\n|prev = Snowblind\n|next = Life on Mars?\n}}\n\n'''\"Leave a Light On\"''' is the sixteenth episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|sixteenth season]] of the American [[medical drama]]  television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and the 358th episode  overall, which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on March 5, 2020. The episode was written by [[Elizabeth Finch]] and directed by [[Debbie Allen]]. It marked the final appearance of [[Justin Chambers]] as [[Alex Karev]].\n\nOn January 10, 2020, it was announced that Chambers left the series, having already made his last physical appearance in the November 14, 2019 episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep350|My Shot]]\", the 350th episode revolving around the trial for Meredith's medical license.<ref name=\"last\">{{Cite web|url= https://deadline.com/2020/01/justin-chambers-leaving-greys-anatomy-exit-15-years-16-seasons-alex-karev-abc-1202826876/|title=Justin Chambers Leaving Grey\u2019s Anatomy After 15 Years|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 10, 2020|access-date=January 10, 2020}}</ref> Showrunner [[Krista Vernoff]] discussed the challenge in writing Alex off without Chambers physically being there, having left the show suddenly. Vernoff said, \"It was a very careful threading of a needle, where we are giving a little bit of information and pain to Jo,\" she said, adding, \"We\u2019re, episode by episode, illuminating the story of where Alex is.

Stevens was last seen in the episode, \"[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]\" in 2010, and appears for the first time again in archive footage, as details of her current situation are revealed, along with Chambers' character. Chambers returns for the episode in voice-over, as the episode takes a retrospective approach, as he narrates much of what has happened to him since.\n\nThe episode's original broadcast was watched by 6.30 million viewers and registered the show's best ratings in six weeks, since the mid-season premiere. It received a polarizing response from fans and critics alike, who were divided on the show's handling of Alex's exit, but many largely felt it made sense given the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode opens with archive footage of [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]])'s speech to the original interns in the pilot episode. It features [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]). Meredith Grey then provides her signature episodic [[voice-over]], telling a \"lame joke\" about a patient saying, \"Hey doc, it hurts when I go like this\" to which the doctor responds, \"Well don't go like this\" and says that while lame, \"it is nonetheless true that as human beings, we cannot help but want to follow our own instincts, guts and primal urges no matter how much it hurts\". A sequence follows, showing [[Jo Karev]] ([[Camilla Luddington]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) and Meredith Grey (Pompeo) receiving letters from Alex Karev (Chambers). As the three begin reading the letters, Alex (Chambers) provides voice-over of his written letters, declaring that he's not leaving, but has already left \u2015 he is gone.\n\nThe episode then provides a retrospective of landmark storylines in the series integral to Alex's whole journey, from his arrogant, smart-mouth days in the early seasons to his maturation as a successful pediatrics surgeon, devoted friend and partner to Izzie and later Jo. It also shows flashbacks of his relationship with Izzie, her cancer battle and their wedding. It also shows flashbacks of the original five interns' friendship and Meredith's growing friendship with Alex throughout all sixteen seasons. Alex explains to Meredith that the form of a letter was not the way he wanted to say goodbye. He tells Meredith that she was always the one to set him straight, and it provides flashbacks to Alex having to face up to his problems, rather than run away. Alex then says he does not want to be set straight, or for Meredith to say the right thing, because the one right thing isn't in Seattle. Alex then reveals he is with Izzie (Katherine Heigl).\n\nFollowing this revelation, flashbacks of Alex and Izzie's early relationship is shown. As this goes on, Alex reveals he contacted her during Meredith's trial to maintain her medical license for a recommendation letter. He admits the trial gave him an excuse to finally contact Izzie, to know if she was alive and well. After brief exchange on the phone, Alex says he heard little voices in the background and asked if Izzie had kids and after a silence, she revealed that she did. And it turns out they are his children.\n\n[[File:Alex16x08final.png|thumb|225px|right|[[Alex Karev]]'s ([[Justin Chambers]]) last physical appearance includes this scene in the 350th episode \"[[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)#ep350|My Shot]]\".<ref name=\"last\" />]]\n\nAlex reveals Izzie was single, wanted kids and because the cancer nuked her eggs, she could not have biological children but she had their embryos. Flashbacks from the fifth season show Alex and Izzie's scenes revolving around the embryos. Alex explains he was too freaked out to care what she did with them so he signed papers off so that she could do whatever she wanted with them, as a flashback to Alex's worries of her surviving cancer is shown. He says he is aware he should have told Jo and Meredith, but instead of telling them, he got through the trial and went to see his children. His children \u2015 twins named Alexis and Eli \u2015 are described as \"hilarious and stubborn\" like Izzie, Alexis having Izzie's eyes and Eli's smile being crooked like his, that the kids want to be doctors and they bake like Izzie, and that he lives on a farm in the middle of no-where in Kansas. He also reveals Izzie works as a surgical oncologist and has made so much progress. Alex again says she could come up and bring him back to Seattle, but he hopes she does not do that and that he is finally where he should be, and that he has never had that before. Alex says he hopes when she is ready and not mad that she can come up and meet his children.\n\nFlashbacks also show Jo and Alex's relationship, as well as Jo's own journey briefly, as Jo reads her letter from him. Alex details how deeply sorry he is, but that he is in love with Izzie as well. Alex admits the letter is the worst thing he is done, and that Jo has earned so much better, but also mentions the children he has with her. Alex tells Jo he felt he and Izzie had unfinished business and that they spoke as if no time had passed, that they were frozen in time. Alex says he needs to give the children the life he and Jo never had. Alex reveals he went to a lawyer, signed divorce papers and left her his shares at Grey Sloan.\n\nWebber, at an AA meeting, relates Alex's situation with Jo and Izzie to Ellis and Adele, and that he wishes he got to see [[Maggie Pierce]] ([[Kelly McCreary]]) grow up, so he cannot be mad at him no matter how hard he wants to be, although admits his bitterness that he could not say goodbye simply as a teacher. It finally shows another sequence of Izzie and Alex's relationship, this time through dialogue of Izzie's declarations of love and finally shows the resemblance of Izzie's children to her.\n\nBailey talks to Ben ([[Jason George]]) about Joey, and relates the situation to Alex's upbringing. They decide to keep caring for him. Meanwhile, Jo swallows her emotions and decides to continue to work casually after reading the letter as Link ([[Chris Carmack]]) calls her his hero. Jo responds, \"Mine too\". The episode ends with Meredith talking to her daughter, Zola (Aniela Gumbs) and preparing to tell her that Uncle Alex is gone, with a voice-over of Meredith to say there really is no good way to say goodbye.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by [[Elisabeth Finch]] and directed by [[Debbie Allen]]. Several former characters appear in the episode through archive footage such as [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), Shane Ross ([[Gaius Charles]]), [[Stephanie Edwards (Grey's Anatomy)|Stephanie Edwards]] ([[Jerrika Hinton]]), [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), Helen Karev ([[Lindsay Wagner]]) and Jimmy Evans ([[James Remar]]). The only current main cast members that appeared in new scenes were [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]), [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]), Jo Karev ([[Camilla Luddington]]) and Atticus \"Link\" Lincoln ([[Chris Carmack]]).\n\nThe episode re-visits [[Katherine Heigl]]'s character, [[Izzie Stevens]], for the first time in over ten years. Alex and Izzie's storyline was left unresolved in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|sixth season]], after Heigl departed the series abruptly during her maternity leave. In a [[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|January 2010 episode]], Stevens leaves after she is unable to repair things with Alex. [[Joan Rater]], the episode's writer, explained that Stevens getting better propelled Karev to let her go.<ref name=Matter>{{cite web|url=http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |title=Joan Rater on \"I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked\"... |publisher=ABC |work=Grey Matter |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2012 |author=Rater, Joan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513155822/http://www.greyswriters.com/2010/01/joan-rater-on-i-like-you-so-much-better-when-youre-naked.html |archive-date=May 13, 2013 |df= }}</ref> Izzie's absence after this was intended to be temporary, with the character returning in the season's final five episodes. However, Heigl did not show up for filming on March 1, 2010 for the season's twentieth episode. Heigl's three month family leave in Utah propelled her to quit the show entirely, feeling she needed more time to bond with her adoptive daughter. She explained, \"So before I was due back, I spoke again to [[Shonda Rhimes|Shonda]] about wanting to leave. Then I waited at home until I was given the formal okay that I was off the show. The rumors that I refused to return were totally untrue.\" While Heigl felt the departure was \u201camicable\u201d, despite the shock and feeling that something could have worked out, Heigl felt Izzie returning only to leave again after already having done so twice would \"feel a little manipulative\" and she felt that she had not created a bond with her adoptive daughter yet that made her feel like she needed her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/03/24/katherine-heigl-greys-anatomy-official-ew/|title=This week's cover (exclusive!): Katherine Heigl confirms 'Grey's Anatomy' departure|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|date=March 24, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Alex and Izzie's arc had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"Closure\">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/08/22/greys-anatomy-closure-for-alex-izzie/|title='Grey's Anatomy' Exclusive: Closure is coming for Alex/Izzie fans |first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure.

Karev was a constant; Where else would he go? After a rough upbringing, he craved stability \u2013 making the timing of his exit all the more perplexing.

Then Fremont elaborated, \"It just felt like Alex dying, although tragic, would\u2019ve been the only way to write the character off that made sense after everything he went through\" and that \"Alex Karev we\u2019ve watched for \u2014 holy hell, almost two decades if we\u2019re rounding up \u2014 wouldn\u2019t do that\" although admitted the exit \"almost works\", as Alex chooses to not miss a second with his children and to be a great dad, but that \"Alex not being mad for one single second about the fact that Izzie had secret kids five years ago and never told him\" made \"less sense\". Fremont also noted that Alex could have asked Jo to move to Kansas to help him be there for his children so that it was obviously \"ALSO about the women he loves\". She discussed the dramatic nature of Richard's speech saying, \"I\u2019m sorry, Richard\u2019s speech is lovely and all, but he\u2019s acting like he can\u2019t just go to Kansas and see the guy. Richard thrives on that drama, you guys. Fremont also commented on Jo's reaction saying, \"Poor Jo! And poor me for having to sympathize with a character I can\u2019t stand, you know? Jo\u2019s letter truly sucks\", with both commenting on the impersonal nature of the letter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/greys-anatomy-recap-season-16-episode-16-leave-a-light-on.html|title=Grey\u2019s Anatomy Recap: A Dear Jo Letter|work=Vulture|last=Fremont|first=Maggie|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAshley Bissette Sumerel for ''Telltale-TV'' gave a moderately positive 3.5 out of 5 star review of the episode. She complimented how the writers worked with the circumstances of Chambers' abrupt departure feeling \"[his] sudden exit meant the writers needed to change course and figure out the best way to write out his character, and I believe they did that, with a few exceptions\" and said, I\u2019d actually told a few people that there was one ending for Alex that I felt like I\u2019d be able to accept, and low and behold, this is it. The timing is terrible considering his relationship with Jo, but again, I think in this case, we do have to consider the circumstances.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telltaletv.com/2020/03/greys-anatomy-review-leave-a-light-on-season-16-episode-16/|title=Grey\u2019s Anatomy Review: Leave a Light On (Season 16 Episode 16)|work=Telltale TV|last=Bisette Sumerel|first=Ashley|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSonya Field for ''Hypable'' criticized the \"unrealistic\" storyline, feeling that it underscored Jo and Alex's story \"because he was so ready to leave her\". She opined that the Izzie/Alex flashbacks \"bothered\" her. She finished saying, \"It worries me that this might mean the whole issue will largely be swept under the rug after this episode. It\u2019s already upsetting to see how Alex was able to walk away from Jo so quickly, and I hope they at least handle things differently on Jo\u2019s end.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/greys-anatomy-season-16-episode-16-alex-karev-written-off-the-show/|title=\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 season 16, episode 16 review: Alex Karev says goodbye|work=Hypable|last=Field|first=Sonya|date=March 5, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJasmine Blu for ''TV Fanatic'' gave a mostly negative response to the episode. They noted Meredith as being \"self-absorbed\" saying, \"Meredith has been so far removed from the missing Alex storyline, and before that, she hasn't so much as visited him at Pac-North. Alex's final season had a startling lack of Merlex, so the final goodbye was even bitterer\", while also acknowledging how no goodbye, short of death, would satisfy everyone. The reviewer criticized Alex's development in the episode saying, \"Alex, who has spent years resenting people for abandoning him turned around and left those he loves. It's a struggle to wrap one's head around it.\" Blu also criticized Alex for seemingly using his sick mother as an alibi, and noted it as being uncharacteristic of the \"straight-shooter\" and \"guy who tells it like it is whether you like it or not\" that fans know him by. The reviewer also noted that it was \"already a disservice that it took so long for anyone to pay attention to his absence\" and that \"Jo probably should've contacted his mother ages ago\". Blu also criticized the storyline for how it will service Jo as a tragedy later, calling \"Woe is Joe hours [...] irritating\" and that \"so much of Alex's storylines in the last few seasons have been playing second to Jo.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2020/03/when-good-characters-cant-break-away-from-being-love-interests-w/|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 16 Episode 16 Review: Leave a Light On|work=TVFanatic|last=Blu|first=Jasmine|date=March 6, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Grey's Anatomy episodes|16}}\n\n[[Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 16) episodes]]\n[[Category:2020 American television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Thelonggoneblues", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReviews", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_a_Light_On_(Grey%27s_Anatomy)"}

The CAA will have separate departments to deal with safety, economic regulation and grievance resolution, as well as a full-fledged environment department. It will also have an independent accident investigation bureau. The Authority will also have the autonomy to recruit staff. Currently, the DGCA is understaffed and does not have any recruitment powers. \nThe CAA will have administrative and financial powers similar to those of the American FAA. These powers will redefine the regulator's role and better equip it to face the challenges of the growing Aviation sector in the country. Employees working with DGCA will be transferred to the CAA.<ref name = \"IT\"/>\n\nThe estimated cost of establishing the new Authority would be around Rs 11.2 million. The CAA would be self-financing and have a separate fund called the 'Civil Aviation Authority of India Fund' that would finance its entire expenses. It would have a Chairperson, a Director General and 7-9 members appointed by the Central Government. These members will be qualified in the fields of aviation safety, aircraft engineering, flight standard operations, aerodromes, air navigation systems and air space management.<ref name = \"NDTV\">{{cite news|title=Bill to replace DGCA by new aviation regulator likely to be tabled in Parliament: report |url=http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bill-to-replace-dgca-by-new-aviation-regulator-likely-to-be-tabled-in-parliament-report-320414|publisher=[[NDTV Profit]] |date= 3 April 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Air accident investigation==\nPreviously the DGCA conducted investigations and gave information to the investigations established by the Court of Inquiry and the Committee Inquiry.

Ch\u00f6d combines praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 philosophy with specific meditation methods and  [[Vajrayana|tantric]] ritual. The chod practitioner seeks to tap the power of fear through activities such as rituals set in graveyards, and visualisation of offering their bodies in a [[ganachakra|tantric feast]] in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the ultimate test.{{sfn|Machig Labdr\u00f6n|2003|p=55}}\n\n==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==\n{{bo|t=\u0f42\u0f45\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f92\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f50\u0f56\u0f66\u0f0b|w=gcod sgrub thabs}} and [[Sanskrit]] ''chedas\u0101dhan\u0101'' both literally mean \"cutting practice\".\n\nIn [[Standard Tibetan]] (the prestige dialect associated with Buddhism that is based on the speech of [[Lhasa]]), the pronunciation of ''gcod'' is [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|t\u0255\u00f8\u02d0}}/.\n\n==Key elements of the practice==\n[[File:Ch\u00f6d practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|Ch\u00f6d practitioners at [[Boudhanath]] stupa]]\nCh\u00f6d literally means \"cutting through\".

Examples of demons are [[ignorance]], [[anger]] and, in particular, the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] of perceiving the self as inherently meaningful, contrary to the Buddhist doctrine of [[anatta]] (non-self).

As the mindstream of Kamala\u015b\u012bla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha by the name of Dampa Sangye came across the vacant \"physical basis\"<ref>''kuten''</ref> of Kamala\u015b\u012bla. Padampa Sangye, was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamala\u015b\u012bla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamala\u015b\u012bla's body. Padampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamala\u015b\u012bla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Ch\u00f6d which contributed to the Mahamudra Ch\u00f6d of Machig Labdr\u00f6n. The mindstream of Kamala\u015b\u012bla was unable to return to his own body and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Padampa Sangye.<ref name=\"Thrangu, Khenchen 2007\"/><ref name=\"lionsroar\">{{cite web|url=http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm|title=Tantric Glossary|publisher=lionsroar.name|accessdate=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130111603/http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm|archive-date=2016-01-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Third Karmapa: systematizer of Ch\u00f6d===\nCh\u00f6d was a marginal and peripheral practice, and the Ch\u00f6dpas who engaged in it were from outside traditional Tibetan Buddhist and Indian monastic institutions, with a contraindication against all but the most advanced practitioners to go to the [[charnel ground]]s to practice. Texts concerning Ch\u00f6d were both exclusive and rare in the early tradition school.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}} Indeed, due to the itinerant and nomadic lifestyles of practitioners, they could carry few texts. Hence they were also known as ''kusulu'' or ''kusulupa'', that is, studying texts rarely whilst focusing on meditation and [[praxis (process)|praxis]]: \"The nonconventional attitude of living on the fringe of society kept the Ch\u00f6dpas aloof from the wealthy monastic institutions and printing houses. As a result, the original Ch\u00f6d texts and commentaries, often copied by hand, never enjoyed any wide circulation, and many have been lost forever.\"{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}}\n\n[[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]], (1284\u20131339) was an  important systematizer of Ch\u00f6d teachings and significantly assisted in their promulgation within the literary and practice lineages of the Kagyu, Nyingma, and particularly Dzogchen.{{citation needed|date=September 2013|reason=Is Dzogchen not Nyingma?}} It is in this transition from the charnel grounds to the monastic institutions of Tibetan Buddhism that the rite of Ch\u00f6d became an inner practice; the charnel ground became an internal imaginal environment. Schaeffer<ref>1995: p.15</ref> conveys that the Third Karmapa was a systematizer of the Ch\u00f6d developed by Machig Labdr\u00f6n and lists a number of his works in Tibetan on Ch\u00f6d.

Because of this, material on Ch\u00f6d has been less widely available to Western readers than some other tantric Buddhist practices. The first Western reports of Ch\u00f6d came from a French adventurer who lived in Tibet, [[Alexandra David-N\u00e9el]] in her travelogue ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet,'' published in 1932. [[Walter Evans-Wentz]] published the first translation of a Ch\u00f6d liturgy in his 1935 book ''Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines''.

As the mindstream of Kamala\u015b\u012bla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha by the name of Dampa Sangye came across the vacant \"physical basis\"<ref>''kuten''</ref> of Kamala\u015b\u012bla. Padampa Sangye, was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamala\u015b\u012bla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamala\u015b\u012bla's body. Padampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamala\u015b\u012bla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Ch\u00f6d which contributed to the Mahamudra Ch\u00f6d of Machig Labdr\u00f6n.

Texts concerning Ch\u00f6d were both exclusive and rare in the early tradition school.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}} Indeed, due to the itinerant and nomadic lifestyles of practitioners, they could carry few texts. Hence they were also known as ''kusulu'' or ''kusulupa'', that is, studying texts rarely whilst focusing on meditation and [[praxis (process)|praxis]]: \"The nonconventional attitude of living on the fringe of society kept the Ch\u00f6dpas aloof from the wealthy monastic institutions and printing houses.
