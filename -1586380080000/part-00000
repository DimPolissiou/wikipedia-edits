Salem is an [[American Shorthair]] cat who lives with [[Sabrina Spellman]], [[Hilda Spellman]] and [[Zelda Spellman]] in the fictional town of Greendale, located near [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]]. A former witch, Salem was sentenced by the Witch's Council to spend 100 years as a cat, as punishment for trying to take over the world. Salem first appeared alongside Sabrina in ''Archie's Mad House'' #22 in 1962, and was created by [[George Gladir]] and [[Dan DeCarlo]].\n\nEarlier comics portray Salem as a normal [[Tabby cat|orange-colored feline]] who does not speak. With the debut and success of the 1990s live-action ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' sitcom, Salem's backstory and character underwent several [[retcon]]s to bring it more in line with the sitcom's version. A late 1990s story initially revealed Salem was turned into a cat for jilting Enchantra, the Head Witch, at the altar. A similar version of events was presented in a 1990s [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (film)|live-action TV movie]], where he was imprisoned in the form of a cat for attempting to use his magic to make a mortal love him. However, the comics eventually gave Salem a similar backstory that was shown in the sitcom and its spinoff, ''[[Sabrina: The Animated Series]]''. Further details about Salem's past before his transformation into a cat were revealed in the 2000s [[manga]]-inspired version of the comic, written and drawn by [[Tania del Rio]].<ref>''Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' #58\u2013100, August 2004 \u2013 April 2009</ref>\n\nIn the graphic novel ''[[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]'', Salem is given a more serious role to fit with the series' darker tone.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.themarysue.com/things-we-saw-today-chilling-adventures-sabrina-salem/ |title=Things We Saw Today: ''The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'' Shows Off Its Salem |first=Marykate |last=Jasper |work=[[The Mary Sue]] |date=February 10, 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018 }}</ref> In this version, Salem often acts as a [[conscience]] to Sabrina, questioning her hot-headed or more daring ideas.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===''Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' (sitcom)===\n{{See also|List of Sabrina the Teenage Witch characters#Salem Saberhagen}}\n\n====Personality====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Salem Saberhaguen.jpg|thumbnail|245px|Salem, as portrayed in the live-action sitcom]] -->\nSalem has a rapier wit and is often the first character to come up with the [[One-line joke|one-liner]]s or obvious puns in a scene. In addition to world domination, his ambitious plotting often includes attempts to become [[wealth]]y, achieve [[celebrity]] status, regain his magical powers, and return to his human form. He consistently gives bad advice to Sabrina, often involving using magic to solve a problem, which always ends up leaving Sabrina with even more problems than with which she began. His favorite pastimes include playing with yarn, lint spotting, surfing the internet, and reading Sabrina's diary. He loves Lizard Flakes, a snack for cats which is said to be [[Junk food|fattening]] and full of [[cholesterol]]. In the show's pilot, he made the remark to Sabrina that he misses being able to dance. In some episodes, Salem acts more like a cat than a human, as if he was really one all along.\n\nDespite his arrogance, greed, and [[sarcasm]], he is shown in many episodes to genuinely care about the Spellmans, especially Sabrina. He also has a soft-spot for Harvey, to the point that he once expressed a wish that he would be [[Groomsman|best man]] at Harvey and Sabrina's wedding. Harvey learned Salem's true identity sometime around the end of high school, but prior to this Sabrina would occasionally use a 'Doctor Dolittle' spell that would allow Harvey to talk with Salem and believe there was nothing unusual about it when circumstances prompted Sabrina and her aunts to go away and Harvey was left in charge of Salem's care.\n\n====History====\nSalem was a [[witch]], sentenced by the Witch's Council to spend 100 years as a [[cat]] with no magical powers. In the original comic (depending on the story), he retains limited powers via incantations, but requires Sabrina's magic finger to enact them. In the series, he retains no powers and was sentenced as punishment for his attempt to take over the world. In the film, he was cursed to spend a century as a cat because he had used his powers to impress a mortal. At the beginning of the [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|television series]], he had already served 25 years. Salem generally serves as some of the show's [[comic relief]], with his quick-witted quips and [[deadpan]] delivery. Despite his [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomania]]cal desires for world domination, he is genuinely a good person and protective guardian to Sabrina. In the series he would generally serve two roles: one as a mentor / [[Familiar spirit|\"familiar\"]] - commonly an animal that helps a young witch, for Sabrina, as she found it easier to talk with him about her problems, or the mischievous [[Antihero|anti-hero]] in the episode, such as finding an illegal way to become human again without being punished. He has shown on multiple occasions to be very emotionally attached to Sabrina; in the fourth season, when Sabrina left to live with her father in [[Paris]], Salem missed her so much he started a civil war on Pluto, in order to get her back to Westbridge.\n\nThe leaders of his attempted revolution were also turned into house pets. [[Newt]], the pet of Hilda and Zelda's cousin Monty, was heavily involved with the scheme, for the promised reward of [[Denmark]]. Another follower, Duke (played by [[Dick Van Dyke]]), had a reduced sentence and was set free during the series, though Salem tried to use him to take over the world again. A talking [[guinea pig]] named Stonehenge (\"Stony\" for short) was introduced in the [[Sabrina Goes to Rome|first made-for-television film]], but whether or not he was ever human is unknown. Hilda was also one of Salem's followers; her punishment was to keep Salem free of [[Dipylidium caninum|worms]] during his period as a feline, although she was pardoned at the end of season five. During season one, Salem was visited by his parole officer, to whom he insisted that his transformation is under way, but he accidentally lets it slip that he still yearns for control of the planet. By the end of the series, Salem never did turn back into his human form, and a brief period where he was transferred into the body of one of Sabrina's classmates resulted in an extra seventy-five years being added to his sentence, even after he confessed to his mistakes when he realized that Sabrina was to be punished for his actions.\n\n====Family====\nMembers of Salem's blood family include his daughter, Annabelle, whom Salem cares deeply for but is estranged from due his shame about being a cat. Salem managed to make it to her wedding and performed all the duties of father of the bride. Salem is visited by his mother and initially dreads the impending visit as she is highly critical. Upon her learning he is a cat, she cannot help but be delighted by how cute his new form is and pampered him to the point Sabrina missed her own mother and went to visit her. It is revealed later in the episode that Salem's mother was unknowingly [[Allergy to cats|allergic to cats]]. Another member is Salem's grandfather, who is a [[Homelessness|hobo]]. According to Salem, Salem's grandmother claims he (Salem's grandfather) was lost at sea. He also mentioned having an uncle Goliath and Morty. In one episode, Salem mentions that his father's name was Gummo, implying that he died.\n\nSalem often uses [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] words and mentioned his cousin Cheryl's [[Bat Mitzvah]] in \"Sabrina in Wonderland\".\n\n====Relatives====\n*'''Mrs. Saberhagen''', Salem's mother. She was strict but well-meaning and did not know that Salem was a cat until she came to visit him. She pampered him and he loved it. But she found out that she was allergic to cats and had to leave early.\n*'''Uncle Morty''' is Salem's uncle. He is rude and has no manners.\n*'''Gummo''' is Salem's father.

The four trained cats portraying the character were named Elvis, Lucy, Salem, and Witch.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d6NUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fjsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5592,3980694&dq=salem+sabrina&hl=en Beaver County Times - Google News Archive Search]</ref> This part was performed by three puppeteers and two different animatronic puppets. The mechanical Salems were originally made by Animal Makers,<ref>Animal Makers [http://www.animalmakers.com website]</ref> but in early 1998 they were fired, and their puppets were replaced with ones made by [[The Chiodo Brothers]].

Salem is an [[American Shorthair]] cat who lives with [[Sabrina Spellman]], [[Hilda Spellman]] and [[Zelda Spellman]] in the fictional town of Greendale, located near [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]]. A former witch, Salem was sentenced by the Witch's Council to spend 100 years as a cat, as punishment for trying to take over the world. Salem first appeared alongside Sabrina in ''Archie's Mad House'' #22 in 1962, and was created by [[George Gladir]] and [[Dan DeCarlo]].\n\nEarlier comics portray Salem as a normal [[Tabby cat|orange-colored feline]] who does not speak. With the debut and success of the 1990s live-action ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' sitcom, Salem's backstory and character underwent several [[retcon]]s to bring it more in line with the sitcom's version. A late 1990s story initially revealed Salem was turned into a cat for jilting Enchantra, the Head Witch, at the altar. A similar version of events was presented in a 1990s [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (film)|live-action TV movie]], where he was imprisoned in the form of a cat for attempting to use his magic to make a mortal love him. However, the comics eventually gave Salem a similar backstory that was shown in the sitcom and its spinoff, ''[[Sabrina: The Animated Series]]''. Further details about Salem's past before his transformation into a cat were revealed in the 2000s [[manga]]-inspired version of the comic, written and drawn by [[Tania del Rio]].<ref>''Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' #58\u2013100, August 2004 \u2013 April 2009</ref>\n\nIn the graphic novel ''[[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]'', Salem is given a more serious role to fit with the series' darker tone.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.themarysue.com/things-we-saw-today-chilling-adventures-sabrina-salem/ |title=Things We Saw Today: ''The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'' Shows Off Its Salem |first=Marykate |last=Jasper |work=[[The Mary Sue]] |date=February 10, 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018 }}</ref> In this version, Salem often acts as a [[conscience]] to Sabrina, questioning her hot-headed or more daring ideas.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===''Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' (sitcom)===\n{{See also|List of Sabrina the Teenage Witch characters#Salem Saberhagen}}\n\n====Personality====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Salem Saberhaguen.jpg|thumbnail|245px|Salem, as portrayed in the live-action sitcom]] -->\nSalem has a rapier wit and is often the first character to come up with the [[One-line joke|one-liner]]s or obvious puns in a scene. In addition to world domination, his ambitious plotting often includes attempts to become [[wealth]]y, achieve [[celebrity]] status, regain his magical powers, and return to his human form. He consistently gives bad advice to Sabrina, often involving using magic to solve a problem, which always ends up leaving Sabrina with even more problems than with which she began. His favorite pastimes include playing with yarn, lint spotting, surfing the internet, and reading Sabrina's diary. He loves Lizard Flakes, a snack for cats which is said to be [[Junk food|fattening]] and full of [[cholesterol]]. In the show's pilot, he made the remark to Sabrina that he misses being able to dance. In some episodes, Salem acts more like a cat than a human, as if he was really one all along.\n\nDespite his arrogance, greed, and [[sarcasm]], he is shown in many episodes to genuinely care about the Spellmans, especially Sabrina. He also has a soft-spot for Harvey, to the point that he once expressed a wish that he would be [[Groomsman|best man]] at Harvey and Sabrina's wedding. Harvey learned Salem's true identity sometime around the end of high school, but prior to this Sabrina would occasionally use a 'Doctor Dolittle' spell that would allow Harvey to talk with Salem and believe there was nothing unusual about it when circumstances prompted Sabrina and her aunts to go away and Harvey was left in charge of Salem's care.\n\n====History====\nSalem was a [[witch]], sentenced by the Witch's Council to spend 100 years as a [[cat]] with no magical powers. In the original comic (depending on the story), he retains limited powers via incantations, but requires Sabrina's magic finger to enact them. In the series, he retains no powers and was sentenced as punishment for his attempt to take over the world. In the film, he was cursed to spend a century as a cat because he had used his powers to impress a mortal. At the beginning of the [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|television series]], he had already served 25 years. Salem generally serves as some of the show's [[comic relief]], with his quick-witted quips and [[deadpan]] delivery. Despite his [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomania]]cal desires for world domination, he is genuinely a good person and protective guardian to Sabrina. In the series he would generally serve two roles: one as a mentor / [[Familiar spirit|\"familiar\"]] - commonly an animal that helps a young witch, for Sabrina, as she found it easier to talk with him about her problems, or the mischievous [[Antihero|anti-hero]] in the episode, such as finding an illegal way to become human again without being punished. He has shown on multiple occasions to be very emotionally attached to Sabrina; in the fourth season, when Sabrina left to live with her father in [[Paris]], Salem missed her so much he started a civil war on Pluto, in order to get her back to Westbridge.\n\nThe leaders of his attempted revolution were also turned into house pets. [[Newt]], the pet of Hilda and Zelda's cousin Monty, was heavily involved with the scheme, for the promised reward of [[Denmark]]. Another follower, Duke (played by [[Dick Van Dyke]]), had a reduced sentence and was set free during the series, though Salem tried to use him to take over the world again. A talking [[guinea pig]] named Stonehenge (\"Stony\" for short) was introduced in the [[Sabrina Goes to Rome|first made-for-television film]], but whether or not he was ever human is unknown. Hilda was also one of Salem's followers; her punishment was to keep Salem free of [[Dipylidium caninum|worms]] during his period as a feline, although she was pardoned at the end of season five. During season one, Salem was visited by his parole officer, to whom he insisted that his transformation is under way, but he accidentally lets it slip that he still yearns for control of the planet. By the end of the series, Salem never did turn back into his human form, and a brief period where he was transferred into the body of one of Sabrina's classmates resulted in an extra seventy-five years being added to his sentence, even after he confessed to his mistakes when he realized that Sabrina was to be punished for his actions.\n\n====Family====\nMembers of Salem's blood family include his daughter, Annabelle, whom Salem cares deeply for but is estranged from due his shame about being a cat. Salem managed to make it to her wedding and performed all the duties of father of the bride. Salem is visited by his mother and initially dreads the impending visit as she is highly critical. Upon her learning he is a cat, she cannot help but be delighted by how cute his new form is and pampered him to the point Sabrina missed her own mother and went to visit her. It is revealed later in the episode that Salem's mother was unknowingly [[Allergy to cats|allergic to cats]]. Another member is Salem's grandfather, who is a [[Homelessness|hobo]]. According to Salem, Salem's grandmother claims he (Salem's grandfather) was lost at sea. He also mentioned having an uncle Goliath and Morty. In one episode, Salem mentions that his father's name was [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]], implying that he died.\n\nSalem often uses [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] words and mentioned his cousin Cheryl's [[Bat Mitzvah]] in \"Sabrina in Wonderland\".\n\n====Relatives====\n*'''Mrs. Saberhagen''', Salem's mother. She was strict but well-meaning and did not know that Salem was a cat until she came to visit him. She pampered him and he loved it. But she found out that she was allergic to cats and had to leave early.\n*'''Uncle Morty''' is Salem's uncle. He is rude and has no manners.\n*'''Gummo''' is Salem's father.

The four trained cats portraying the character were named Elvis, Lucy, Salem, and Witch.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d6NUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fjsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5592,3980694&dq=salem+sabrina&hl=en Beaver County Times - Google News Archive Search]</ref> This part was performed by three puppeteers and two different animatronic puppets.

Monroe's population was 17,304 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] and was estimated to be 19,363 in 2018.\n\nMonroe was originally founded in 1864 as the town of Park Place, located at the river confluence among several existing settlements in the Tulaco Valley. The townsite was previously a [[trading post]] used by the indigenous [[Skykomish]] people. Park Place was renamed to Monroe in 1890 to honor U.S. President [[James Monroe]], and was moved northeast to be near the tracks of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], which was constructed in 1892. Monroe was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1902 and was selected as the home of a major [[condensed milk]] plant and the state [[reformatory]].\n\nMonroe became a suburban [[bedroom community]] in the late 20th century, serving commuters to [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], Seattle, and the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]]. It is home to the [[Monroe Correctional Complex]], which absorbed the original reformatory in 1998, and the [[Evergreen State Fair]], which runs annually in late summer. The city is located at the junction of two highways, [[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|U.S. Route 2]] and [[Washington State Route 522|State Route 522]], which were expanded in the late 20th century to serve commuters.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and establishment of Park Place===\n\nThe confluence of the [[Skykomish River|Skykomish]] and [[Snoqualmie River|Snoqualmie]] rivers had originally belonged to the indigenous [[Skykomish]] tribe, who predominantly occupied the area between modern-day Monroe and [[Index, Washington|Index]].<ref name=\"Hollenbeck\">{{cite book|last1=Hollenbeck |first1=Jan L. |last2=Moss |first2=Madonna |year=1987 |title=A Cultural Resource Overview: Prehistory, Ethnography and History: Mt.

It is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Skykomish River|Skykomish]], [[Snohomish River|Snohomish]], and [[Snoqualmie River|Snoqualmie]] rivers in the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascade foothills]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} northeast of [[Seattle]]. Monroe's population was 17,304 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] and was estimated to be 19,363 in 2018.\n\nMonroe was originally founded in 1864 as the town of Park Place, located at the river confluence among several existing settlements in the Tulaco Valley. The townsite was previously a [[trading post]] used by the indigenous [[Skykomish]] people. Park Place was renamed to Monroe in 1890 to honor U.S. President [[James Monroe]], and was moved northeast to be near the tracks of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], which was constructed in 1892. Monroe was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1902 and was selected as the home of a major [[condensed milk]] plant and the state [[reformatory]].\n\nMonroe became a suburban [[bedroom community]] in the late 20th century, serving commuters to [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], Seattle, and the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]]. It is home to the [[Monroe Correctional Complex]], which absorbed the original reformatory in 1998, and the [[Evergreen State Fair]], which runs annually in late summer. The city is located at the junction of two highways, [[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|U.S. Route 2]] and [[Washington State Route 522|State Route 522]], which were expanded in the late 20th century to serve commuters.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and establishment of Park Place===\n\nThe confluence of the [[Skykomish River|Skykomish]] and [[Snoqualmie River|Snoqualmie]] rivers had originally belonged to the indigenous [[Skykomish]] tribe, who predominantly occupied the area between modern-day Monroe and [[Index, Washington|Index]].<ref name=\"Hollenbeck\">{{cite book|last1=Hollenbeck |first1=Jan L. |last2=Moss |first2=Madonna |year=1987 |title=A Cultural Resource Overview: Prehistory, Ethnography and History: Mt.
