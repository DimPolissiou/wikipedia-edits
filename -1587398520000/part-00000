In the series, the [[Twelve Colonies]] built approximately 120 Battlestars during their thousand-year war with the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], whose own battleships are known as [[Cylon Basestar|Basestars]].\n\n== ''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978, 1980) ==\n[[Image:TOS-galac.jpg|right|447px|thumb|''Galactica'' (1978 version)]]\n\n=== Introduction ===\n\nOne of several Battlestars constructed by the [[Twelve Colonies|Twelve Colonies of Man]], ''Galactica'' represents the Colonial planet [[Battlestar_Galactica#Caprica|Caprica]], and is crewed mostly by Capricans.

''Galactica'' is commanded by [[Commander Adama]].\n\nIn the pre-Holocaust Colonial Service, battlestars like ''Galactica'' operated as part of numbered naval fleets (e.g. the Fourth Fleet), <ref>\"The Living Legend, Part 1;\" \"Take The 'Celestra'\" ''(1978 TV series)''</ref> A typical fleet comprised 600 fighting ships<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"Take The 'Celestra'\" ''(1978 TV series)''</ref> and operated independently from other fleets.<ref>\"The Living Legend, Part 1;\" \"Take The 'Celestra'\" ''(1978 TV series)'' (dialogue recounts major battles with the Cylons waged by individual fleets)</ref> Since the Holocaust, ''Galactica'' is the military's sole [[capital ship]] of any kind, except briefly for the ''Pegasus''.\n\n=== Speed and armament ===\n''Galactica'' is capable of lightspeed travel,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">\"Experiment in Terra\" ''(1978 TV series)''</ref> although while escorting the refugee fleet she must limit her speed to that of the slowest ship.<ref>\"The Gun on Ice Planet Zero, Part 2 ''(1978 TV series)''</ref> ''Galactica'' also has a complement of shuttles.

They are ''Acropolis,'' ''Atlantia,'' ''Columbia,'' ''Pacifica,'' ''Pegasus,'' ''Rycon,'' and ''Triton''. Of the other ships it is known that ''Atlantia,'' ''Acropolis,'' ''Pacifica,'' and ''Triton'' were destroyed at the Battle of Cimtar in \"Saga of a Star World.\" The ''Columbia'' is mentioned in the episode \"Gun on Ice Planet Zero,\" but it is said to also have been destroyed at Cimtar by a Centurion. ''Rycon'' is mentioned in passing in the episode \"Take The 'Celestra'\" as the ship of Commander Kronus. ''Pegasus'' is encountered in \"The Living Legend.\" Novelizations based on the original series, various comic books, and other sources have named several other Battlestars, including ''Bellerophon,'' ''Solaria,'' ''Cerberus,'' ''Olympia,'' and ''Prometheus''.\n\n== ''Battlestar Galactica'' (2003) ==\n{{Infobox fictional vehicle\n| name      = Battlestar ''Galactica''\n| image     = Battlestar Galactica - Re-imagined series.jpg\n| caption    = Battlestar ''Galactica'' (BS-75)\n| first     = [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Miniseries, Part 1]]\n| affiliation  = [[Colonial Forces (Battlestar Galactica)|Colonial Fleet]]\n| aux_vehicle    = [[Colonial Raptor]]s, Colonial Vipers\n| armaments   = Primary KEWs<br />Point defense KEWs <br />Ship-to-ship missiles<br />[[Nuclear missiles|Nuclear weapons]]\n| propulsion   = [[Jump drive|FTL drives]]<br /> Sublight engines; 1,000-1,500km/sec\n| length     = 1,445m/4,740ft<ref>[http://darthmojo.wordpress.com/2009/04/05/how-big-was-the-colony/#comment-2193 BSG CGI designer Mojo reveals the size of the battlestars]</ref>\n}}\n\nIn the re-imagined series, there were about 120 Battlestars in service prior to the second Cylon attack.\n\n''Galactica'' (BS-75) entered service in the early years of the first [[Cylon War]], under the command of Commander Silas Nash. During her service, ''Galactica'' formed a part of Battlestar Group 75 (BSG 75), a Colonial force described by series creator [[Ronald D. Moore]] as a mixed force of vessels somewhat similar to a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[carrier strike group]]. After graduating from the Colonial Military Academy, [[William Adama]]'s first posting was to ''Galactica'' as a [[Colonial Raptor|Raptor]] pilot.\n\nLike many of her sister ships that survived the first Cylon War, ''Galactica'' underwent refits and upgrades (for example, at the end of her career, she was equipped with the latest Mark VII Viper space superiority fighter). However, the computer systems were never networked nor integrated during these refits.\n\nDue to this lack of network integration at the time of the Cylon attack, ''Galactica'' was unaffected by the infiltration program used by the Cylons to disable Colonial vessels and defense systems, using the Command Navigation Program (CNP), developed by Dr. [[Gaius Baltar]] and subverted by Cylon operative [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] as a back door into such systems.\n\nAt the time of the Cylon Attack, ''Galactica'' was fifty years old and was undergoing formal decommissioning from the Colonial Fleet following her retirement as an operational vessel. The ship had been due to become a museum commemorating the first Cylon War and an educational center. Due to its age and operating conditions, the ship is unofficially known as \"The Bucket\" by the crews of both ''Pegasus'' and ''Galactica''.<ref name=\"The Captain's Hand\">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Captain's Hand| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Another nickname used by the crew is \"The Big G\"<ref name=\"Bastille Day\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Bastille Day (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Bastille Day| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> (a possible reference to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] sailors' nickname for {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, \"The Big E\"). Galactica's starboard launch pod was outfitted as a Cylon war museum; this exhibit remained intact until the final mission against the Cylon colony.\n\nSince the Cylon attack, in keeping with the concept of the original 1978 series, ''Galactica'' became both protector and provider to a small fleet of civilian vessels searching for the legendary planet Earth.\n\n''Galactica'' took heavy damage during its raid on [[New Caprica]], and her hull was now clearly darker with burn marks and missile hits, most notably the three large holes on her back where the armor was weakest.\n\nThe starboard hangar pod had been converted into a museum prior to ''Galactica''{{'}}s intended decommissioning. The starboard hangar deck was used to house civilian refugees from New Caprica after the evacuation, and earned the nickname \"Camp Oilslick\".<ref name=\"Torn\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Torn (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Torn| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> In \"[[A Measure of Salvation]]\", which followed \"[[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]\", Major [[Lee Adama]] informs ''Galactica'' that their [[Colonial Raptor|Raptor]] was on approach to the starboard landing deck, which indicated that the starboard flight pod had started flight operations again.<ref name=\"A Measure of Salvation\">{{cite episode| episodelink=A Measure of Salvation (Battlestar Galactica)| title=A Measure of Salvation| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> However, this is likely a dialogue error because in the finale it was still shown to be a museum and Oilslick was never moved.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Woman King]]\", 300 additional passengers were shown being moved to the starboard hangar deck, and the area was given the name \"Dogsville\" by the ''Galactica'' crew. Upon arriving, each passenger was checked for medical issues by civilian doctors and medical staff. Also now housed in the starboard hangar deck was a makeshift bar called \"Joe's\", located behind a storage area. Joe's was equipped with a bumper pool table, Pyramid arcade area, and a heavily damaged Mark II Viper hanging over the bar. The bar was first seen in the episode \"[[Taking a Break from All Your Worries]]\". The bar appeared to have an alcohol still, similar to the one Chief Tyrol built in the port hangar deck, in the center of it. The piano that Kara Thrace plays in the episode \"[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]\" is located in Joe's Bar.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Passage (Battlestar Galactica)|The Passage]]\" ''Galactica'' was used to house fleet passengers during the trip through a star cluster, leaving the fleet vessels to be flown by skeleton crews with radiation medication.\n\n''Galactica'' was seen taking multiple hits from Cylon nuclear weapons and though the ship suffered damage, she was still operational. It is unclear exactly how well rated the Cylon nuclear weapons were versus ''Galactica''{{'}}s armor. Also, as the nukes detonated outside of the vessel, most of the energy would have been directed and attenuated out into the area of least resistance: space. However, the punishment has apparently begun to accumulate. In \"[[Blood on the Scales]]\", after disabling the [[Jump drive|FTL drive]], Chief Tyrol noticed a large crack in an interior wall; in the subsequent episode, \"[[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]\", a more detailed inspection reveals hairline fractures and more obvious structural damage throughout the ship. The damage is aggravated by the fact that the original builders of the ship 'cut corners' during her construction. Tyrol suggests applying a Cylon organic resin that will bond itself into the hull, both repairing and strengthening the metal as it matures. Admiral Adama initially refuses the idea, but after finding cracks in the bulkheads of his quarters, he gives Tyrol permission to do whatever it takes to repair ''Galactica''. The repairs were not proceeding well, with numerous electrical faults occurring throughout the ship. When Boomer made her escape, she jumped her Raptor close to the port forward section of the bow, causing a spatial distortion which caused massive damage both externally and internally, exacerbating the already heavy structural damage.\n\nAt the onset of the series, ''Galactica''{{'}}s last operational squadron of Mark VII Vipers participated in the decommissioning ceremony before departing the ship for reassignment. The squadron was redirected to intercept a group of Cylon fighters and was subsequently disabled by the Cylon [[computer virus]] and destroyed. The Mark II Vipers meant for ''Galactica''{{'}}s museum display were pressed into service to defend the ship; these and a small number of Mark VIIs comprised the ship's fighter complement until the arrival of the Battlestar ''Pegasus'' midway through the second season. ''Pegasus'' possessed construction facilities and flight simulators that allowed it to build and train new Mark VII vipers and pilots to strengthen the squadrons of both ships. When ''Pegasus'' was destroyed during the liberation of New Caprica, her nearly intact squadrons were transferred to ''Galactica'', giving the latter a full complement of Vipers. By the time of the episode [[He That Believeth in Me]], there were more Vipers available than qualified pilots, and trainees (known as 'nuggets') were pressed into service to defend the fleet. A significant number of pilots participated in the mutiny led by [[Tom Zarek]] and [[Felix Gaeta]].<ref>\"[[Blood on the Scales]]\" and Ronald Moore commentary</ref> The pilots who refused to assist [[William Adama]] in retaking the ship were court-martialed and incarcerated aboard the fleet prison vessel. The further reduction in manpower forces Adama to allow Cylon heavy raiders from the renegade basestar to assist in CAP duties alongside ''Galactica''{{'}}s regular pilots.\n\nDue to the ship's age, battle damage, and subpar materials used in her construction, ''Galactica'' eventually begins to show signs of severe metal fatigue. Attempts to seal the ship's multiple stress fractures with the Cylon resin fail, and Adama orders the ship to be abandoned and stripped of weapons and supplies. The discovery of the Cylon colony gives ''Galactica'' a brief reprieve, and a skeleton crew embarks on a mission to rescue the Cylon/human child Hera.<ref>Daybreak, parts 1 and 2, reimagined series.</ref>\n\nThe crew of volunteers is supplemented by Cylon centurions from the rebel base ship as well as a small number of civilians including [[Laura Roslin]], [[Gaius Baltar]], and Tory Foster. [[Samuel Anders]], a Cylon left in a vegetative state due to brain damage, is connected to the ship's systems, effectively becoming the battlestar's version of a Cylon hybrid.\n\n''Galactica'' jumps to within point blank firing range of the colony, making it impossible for missiles or nukes to be utilized, and sustains more damage in the exchange of gunfire. Anders successfully disrupts the colony's systems and shuts down their weapons. A squadron of Raptors jumps from ''Galactica'''s starboard landing bay, destroying it in the process, and the battlestar is rammed into the colony. Marine and centurion assault teams from the Raptors and from ''Galactica'' are successful in rescuing Hera, but a counter-assault by the remaining Cylon forces in the colony results in a standoff. A truce is negotiated, but hostilities resume when the Final Five fail to transmit the plans for Cylon resurrection to the colony. The colony is hit by several nukes accidentally fired from a disabled Raptor, and begins being pulled into a nearby black hole. [[Kara Thrace]] jumps ''Galactica'' without retracting the landing pods, resulting in severe structural fractures along its length, effectively breaking the ship's back and rendering ''Galactica'' incapable of jumping again.\n\nThrace uses co-ordinates derived from the musical notes of a song that has haunted both her and the Final Five Cylons, resulting in the ship arriving at the planet that will eventually become modern-day Earth. A Raptor is sent to rendezvous with the fleet, and the survivors of the Twelve Colonies settle on the planet along with the remaining Cylon rebels. ''Galactica'' and the other ships in the fleet are abandoned. Admiral Adama flies the last Viper off the ship, and the battlestar and its fleet are scuttled by Samuel Anders, who pilots them directly into the [[Sun]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Battlestar Galactica}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battlestar Galactica (Ship)}}\n[[Category:Battlestar Galactica]]\n[[Category:Fictional spacecraft]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Battlestar Galactica (ship)|other uses|Battlestar Galactica (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe|date=May 2018}}\n{{Original research|date=May 2018}}\n{{notability|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n{{Italic title prefixed|10}}\n'''Battlestar ''Galactica''''' is a space battleship in the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]] and [[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|re-imagined]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''.

The Mark II Vipers meant for ''Galactica''{{'}}s museum display were pressed into service to defend the ship; these and a small number of Mark VIIs comprised the ship's fighter complement until the arrival of the Battlestar ''Pegasus'' midway through the second season. ''Pegasus'' possessed construction facilities and flight simulators that allowed it to build and train new Mark VII vipers and pilots to strengthen the squadrons of both ships. When ''Pegasus'' was destroyed during the liberation of New Caprica, her nearly intact squadrons were transferred to ''Galactica'', giving the latter a full complement of Vipers. By the time of the episode [[He That Believeth in Me]], there were more Vipers available than qualified pilots, and trainees (known as 'nuggets') were pressed into service to defend the fleet. A significant number of pilots participated in the mutiny led by [[Tom Zarek]] and [[Felix Gaeta]].<ref>\"[[Blood on the Scales]]\" and Ronald Moore commentary</ref> The pilots who refused to assist [[William Adama]] in retaking the ship were court-martialed and incarcerated aboard the fleet prison vessel. The further reduction in manpower forces Adama to allow Cylon heavy raiders from the renegade basestar to assist in CAP duties alongside ''Galactica''{{'}}s regular pilots.\n\nDue to the ship's age, battle damage, and subpar materials used in her construction, ''Galactica'' eventually begins to show signs of severe metal fatigue. Attempts to seal the ship's multiple stress fractures with the Cylon resin fail, and Adama orders the ship to be abandoned and stripped of weapons and supplies. The discovery of the Cylon colony gives ''Galactica'' a brief reprieve, and a skeleton crew embarks on a mission to rescue the Cylon/human child Hera.<ref>Daybreak, parts 1 and 2, reimagined series.</ref>\n\nThe crew of volunteers is supplemented by Cylon centurions from the rebel base ship as well as a small number of civilians including [[Laura Roslin]], [[Gaius Baltar]], and Tory Foster. [[Samuel Anders]], a Cylon left in a vegetative state due to brain damage, is connected to the ship's systems, effectively becoming the battlestar's version of a Cylon hybrid.\n\n''Galactica'' jumps to within point blank firing range of the colony, making it impossible for missiles or nukes to be utilized, and sustains more damage in the exchange of gunfire. Anders successfully disrupts the colony's systems and shuts down their weapons. A squadron of Raptors jumps from ''Galactica'''s starboard landing bay, destroying it in the process, and the battlestar is rammed into the colony. Marine and centurion assault teams from the Raptors and from ''Galactica'' are successful in rescuing Hera, but a counter-assault by the remaining Cylon forces in the colony results in a standoff. A truce is negotiated, but hostilities resume when the Final Five fail to transmit the plans for Cylon resurrection to the colony. The colony is hit by several nukes accidentally fired from a disabled Raptor, and begins being pulled into a nearby black hole. [[Kara Thrace]] jumps ''Galactica'' without retracting the landing pods, resulting in severe structural fractures along its length, effectively breaking the ship's back and rendering ''Galactica'' incapable of jumping again.\n\nThrace uses co-ordinates derived from the musical notes of a song that has haunted both her and the Final Five Cylons, resulting in the ship arriving at the planet that will eventually become modern-day Earth. A Raptor is sent to rendezvous with the fleet, and the survivors of the Twelve Colonies settle on the planet along with the remaining Cylon rebels. ''Galactica'' and the other ships in the fleet are abandoned. Admiral Adama flies the last Viper off the ship, and the battlestar and its fleet are scuttled by Samuel Anders, who pilots them directly into the [[Sun]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Battlestar Galactica}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battlestar Galactica (Ship)}}\n[[Category:Battlestar Galactica]]\n[[Category:Fictional spacecraft]]\n", "name_user": "188.243.200.193", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(fictional_spacecraft)"}
