'''\"''Goosey''\"''' (September 22, 1888 &ndash; February 14, 1929) and his brother [[Frank Gusenberg|Frank]] were [[German-American]] [[contract killer]]s and members of Chicago's [[North Side Gang]], the main rival to the [[Chicago Outfit]].  Peter Gusenberg participated in an infamous attack on Al Capone during a vicious gang war.\n\n==Early life==\nPeter Gusenberg Jr. was born at the Alexian Brothers Medical Center in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to Peter Sr. and his wife. He was the firstborn of three sons and the namesake of his father Peter Gusenberg (Gusenberger) Sr. who was a first generation [[Roman Catholic]] emigrant from [[Gusenburg]], a municipality in the [[Trier-Saarburg]] district, in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]] and his wife. His parents moved into a home at 434 Roscoe Street in [[Lakeview, Chicago]] where Peter lived with his brothers Frank (October 11, 1893 [[Chicago, Illinois]]) along with their youngest brother Henry who later moved to 5507 Bernice Avenue, [[Portage Park, Chicago]]. In 1901, when Peter Jr. was twelve years old, he returned home from school and found his mother on the floor, dead. Following this discovery, he pried off his mothers wedding ring, which Peter Sr. had bought for her back in Germany, and pawned it.\n\nAfter graduating from petty crime into more serious offenses, the Gusenberg brothers teamed up with [[Dion O'Banion|Dean O'Banion]], [[Hymie Weiss|Earl \"Hymie\" Weiss]], [[Bugs Moran|George \"Bugs\" Moran]] and other members of the [[North Side Gang]]. Although Peter Jr. and his brother had little formal education, they both learnt to speak German and English. He later married a [[Germans|German]]-[[irish people|Irish]] woman Myrtle Coppleman Gorman and did not let her know about his criminal activities, keeping her under the ruse that he worked as a travelling salesman. He was first incarcerated in 1902 and sent to the [[Joliet Correctional Center]] for burglary in 1906. He was released on a probationary period but violated the terms and conditions of his probation and was sent back to Joliet in 1910 and re-released in 1912. He 1923 he was convicted for his participation in helping rob a mail freight car while stopped at [[Dearborn Station]]. He also helped carry out the murders on [[Antonio Lombardo]] and Pasquale Lolorado with his younger brother [[Frank Gusenberg]] and Albert Kachellek, a fellow cellmate at Joliet. The Gusenberg brothers and Kachellek were killed in the St Valentine's day Massacre February 14, 1929\n\n==Prison time==\nIn the early 1920s, Peter Gusenberg was sent to the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth]] on a mail robbery conviction. While he was in prison, the North Side Gang became embroiled in a vicious gang war with the rival [[Chicago Outfit]], headed first by Johnny Torrio and then Al Capone.  During this warfare, Outfit gunmen had murdered North Side leader O'Banion in his florist shop.  When Peter Gusenberg was released from prison in 1926, he rejoined the North Side Gang, now led by Hymie Weiss, in its war against the Outfit.\n\n==Gang war==\nOn September 20, 1926, Peter Gusenberg participated in the infamous drive-by shooting on the [[Hawthorne Hotel]], Capone's [[Cicero, Illinois]] headquarters.  The North Siders riddled the hotel with thousands of bullets. According to many accounts, the second to last car stopped in front of the hotel restaurant when Peter Gusenberg emerged, clad in a khaki Army shirt and brown overalls, and carrying a [[Thompson submachine gun]]. Kneeling in front of the doorway, Gusenberg emptied the entire 100-round capacity drum into the restaurant, and then casually strolled back to his car, which then sped off. The attack left Capone terrified and he offered a truce between the two gangs. Peace talks faltered on the concessions that the North Siders demanded.\n\nAs the gang war continued, the North Side Gang started to weaken. Three weeks after the Hawthorne Hotel attack, Hymie Weiss was murdered by a Capone hit squad.  Moran now took over the gang.  The North Siders especially wanted to kill [[Jack McGurn|Jack \"Machine Gun\" McGurn]], as he was rumored to have killed Weiss. On at least two occasions, the Gusenberg brothers tried to kill McGurn. Despite wounding him several times, McGurn survived these attempts on his life.\n\nBy late 1928, Moran struck an alliance with Capone rival [[Joe Aiello]]. Aiello and the Gusenberg brothers first killed Antonio Lombardo and then [[Pasqualino Lolordo|Pasqualino \"Patsy\" Lolordo]], two successive presidents of the [[Unione Siciliane]] and both Capone allies. It was these murders that motivated Capone to eliminate Moran and the North Side Gang in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\nOn February 14, 1929, the upper echelon of the North Side gang, including Peter Gusenberg, gathered at the S.M.C. Cartage Company at 2122 N. Clark Street in the [[Mid-North District]] neighborhood. Also there were Frank Gusenberg, Albert Weinshank, Adam Heyer, James Clark, John May, and Dr. Reinhardt Schwimmer (a friend of a gang member). The general accepted story is that the North Siders were waiting for a shipment of hijacked Log Cabin brand whiskey from [[Detroit]] (a ploy devised by Capone). However, this story has been disputed.\n\nTwo men in Chicago police uniforms entered the garage and lined Peter Gusenberg and the other North Siders against the north wall.  At this point, two men in civilian clothing entered from the rear carrying submachine guns. The four gunmen then opened fire with submachine guns and shotguns, killing all seven men, in what became known as the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].  Peter Gusenberg died kneeling in a chair.\n\nPeter's brother Frank was the only initial survivor of the massacre.  When police asked who had shot him, Frank replied, \"No one shot me.\"  He died later that night. Although the killers wiped out most of the North Side Gang, they missed their prime target, Bugs Moran.  Moran had pulled up to the garage just as the shooters were entering.  Because they were dressed as policemen, Moran assumed it was a raid and fled the area.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPeter has been portrayed three times in film:\n* by [[George Segal]] in the 1967 film, ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]'' <ref>{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=John|title=Screen World 1968|date=1983|publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers|isbn=0-819-60309-0|page=62}}</ref>\n* by [[Martin Kove]] in the 1975 film, ''[[Capone (1975 film)|Capone]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Centro sperimentale di cinematografia|title=Bianco e nero: BN., Volume 38|date=1977|publisher=Societ\u00e0 Gestione Editoriali|page=231|language=Italian}}</ref>\n* by [[Ryan Kiser]] in the 2017 film ''[[Gangster Land]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7241654/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title='Gangster Land': Full Cast & Crew |website=[[IMDB]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Gusenberg Sweeper is a [[Grand Theft Auto V]] version of the [[Tommy Gun]], featured in the Valentine's Day Massacre Special.

While he was in prison, the North Side Gang became embroiled in a vicious gang war with the rival [[Chicago Outfit]], headed first by Johnny Torrio and then Al Capone.  During this warfare, Outfit gunmen had murdered North Side leader O'Banion in his florist shop.  When Peter Gusenberg was released from prison in 1926, he rejoined the North Side Gang, now led by Hymie Weiss, in its war against the Outfit.\n\n==Gang war==\nOn September 20, 1926, Peter Gusenberg participated in the infamous drive-by shooting on the [[Hawthorne Hotel]], Capone's [[Cicero, Illinois]] headquarters.  The North Siders riddled the hotel with thousands of bullets. According to many accounts, the second to last car stopped in front of the hotel restaurant when Peter Gusenberg emerged, clad in a khaki Army shirt and brown overalls, and carrying a [[Thompson submachine gun]]. Kneeling in front of the doorway, Gusenberg emptied the entire 100-round capacity drum into the restaurant, and then casually strolled back to his car, which then sped off. The attack left Capone terrified and he offered a truce between the two gangs. Peace talks faltered on the concessions that the North Siders demanded.\n\nAs the gang war continued, the North Side Gang started to weaken. Three weeks after the Hawthorne Hotel attack, Hymie Weiss was murdered by a Capone hit squad.  Moran now took over the gang.  The North Siders especially wanted to kill [[Jack McGurn|Jack \"Machine Gun\" McGurn]], as he was rumored to have killed Weiss. On at least two occasions, the Gusenberg brothers tried to kill McGurn. Despite wounding him several times, McGurn survived these attempts on his life.\n\nBy late 1928, Moran struck an alliance with Capone rival [[Joe Aiello]]. Aiello and the Gusenberg brothers first killed Antonio Lombardo and then [[Pasqualino Lolordo|Pasqualino \"Patsy\" Lolordo]], two successive presidents of the [[Unione Siciliane]] and both Capone allies. It was these murders that motivated Capone to eliminate Moran and the North Side Gang in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\nOn February 14, 1929, the upper echelon of the North Side gang, including Peter Gusenberg, gathered at the S.M.C. Cartage Company at 2122 N. Clark Street in the [[Mid-North District]] neighborhood. Also there were Frank Gusenberg, Albert Weinshank, Adam Heyer, James Clark, John May, and Dr. Reinhardt Schwimmer (a friend of a gang member). The general accepted story is that the North Siders were waiting for a shipment of hijacked Log Cabin brand whiskey from [[Detroit]] (a ploy devised by Capone). However, this story has been disputed.\n\nTwo men in Chicago police uniforms entered the garage and lined Peter Gusenberg and the other North Siders against the north wall.  At this point, two men in civilian clothing entered from the rear carrying submachine guns. The four gunmen then opened fire with submachine guns and shotguns, killing all seven men, in what became known as the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]].  Peter Gusenberg died kneeling in a chair.\n\nPeter's brother Frank was the only initial survivor of the massacre.  When police asked who had shot him, Frank replied, \"No one shot me.\"  He died later that night. Although the killers wiped out most of the North Side Gang, they missed their prime target, Bugs Moran.  Moran had pulled up to the garage just as the shooters were entering.  Because they were dressed as policemen, Moran assumed it was a raid and fled the area.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPeter has been portrayed three times in film:\n* by [[George Segal]] in the 1967 film, ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]'' <ref>{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=John|title=Screen World 1968|date=1983|publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers|isbn=0-819-60309-0|page=62}}</ref>\n* by [[Martin Kove]] in the 1975 film, ''[[Capone (film)|Capone]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Centro sperimentale di cinematografia|title=Bianco e nero: BN., Volume 38|date=1977|publisher=Societ\u00e0 Gestione Editoriali|page=231|language=Italian}}</ref>\n* by [[Ryan Kiser]] in the 2017 film ''[[Gangster Land]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7241654/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title='Gangster Land': Full Cast & Crew |website=[[IMDB]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Gusenberg Sweeper is a [[Grand Theft Auto V]] version of the [[Tommy Gun]], featured in the Valentine's Day Massacre Special.

Westview Press.</ref>\n\nThe mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of [[cetaceans]] to another. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as whales, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, are much more dependent on sound for communication and sensation than are land mammals, because other senses are of limited effectiveness in water. [[Visual perception|Sight]] is less effective for marine mammals because of the particulate way in which the ocean scatters [[light]]. [[Olfaction|Smell]] is also limited, as [[molecule]]s diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. However, the [[speed of sound]] is roughly four times greater in water than in the atmosphere at [[sea level]]. As sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and [[cetology|cetologists]] are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased [[ambient noise]] in the world's oceans caused by [[ship]]s, [[sonar]] and marine seismic surveys.<ref name=\"Melc\u00f3n2012\"/>\n\nThe word \"[[song]]\" is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the [[humpback whale]]. This is included with or in comparison with [[music]], and male humpback whales have been described as \"inveterate [[composers]]\" of songs that are \"'strikingly similar' to human musical traditions\".<ref>Payne Roger, quoted in: Author(s): Susan Milius. \"Music without Borders\", p. 253.

This clicking sequences reportedly allow the groups to coordinate foraging activities.<ref>Michel Andre and Cees Kamminga (2000) Rhythmic dimension in the echolocation click trains of sperm whales: a possible function of identification and communication Journal of Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, Vol. 80, pp. 163-169.</ref>\n\n==Production of sound==\n[[Humans]] produce [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] sounds by passing air through the [[larynx]]. Within the larynx, when the [[vocal cords]] are brought close together, the passing air will force them to alternately close and open, separating the continuous airstream into discrete pulses of air that are heard as a vibration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dosits.org/animals/soundproduction/mammalsproduce/ |date=July 2009 |title=How do marine mammals produce sounds? |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref> This vibration is further modified by [[speech organs]] in the [[mouth|oral]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal]] cavities, creating sounds which are used in [[human voice|human speech]].\n\nCetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans:&nbsp;the&nbsp;''Odontoceti''&nbsp;([[toothed whales]]\u2014including dolphins) and the ''Mysticeti'' ([[baleen whale]]s\u2014including the largest whales, such as the [[blue whale]]).\n\n===Odontocete whales ===\n[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|left|Process in a dolphin echolocation: in green the sounds generated by the dolphin, in red from the fish.]]\n[[Image:Dolphin head.svg|300px|thumb|alt=Outline of what's inside a dolphin head. The skull is to the rear of the head, with the jaw bones extending narrowly forward to the nose. The anterior bursa occupies most of the upper front of the head, ahead of the skull and above the jaw. A network of air passages run from the upper roof of the mouth, past the back of the anterior bursa, to the [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]]. The posterior bursa is a small region behind the air passages, opposite the anterior bursa. Small phonic tips connect the bursa regions to the air passages.|Idealized dolphin head showing the regions involved in sound production. This image was redrawn from Cranford (2000).]]\nOdontocetes produce rapid bursts of high-frequency clicks that are thought to be primarily for [[animal echolocation|echolocation]]. Specialized organs in an odontocete produce collections of clicks and buzzes at frequencies from 0.2 to 150&nbsp;kHz to obtain sonic information about its environment. Lower frequencies are used for distance echolocation, due to the fact that shorter wavelengths do not travel as far as longer wavelengths underwater. Higher frequencies are more effective at shorter distances, and can reveal more detailed information about a target. Echoes from clicks convey, not only the distance to the target, but also the size, shape, speed, and vector of its movement. Additionally, echolocation allows the odontocete to easily discern the difference between objects that are different in material composition, even if visually identical, by their different densities. Individuals also appear to be able to isolate their own echoes during pod feeding activity without interference from other pod members' echolocations.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_acoustics.php|title=Page not found - Dolphin Research Center|author=|date=|website=Dolphin Research Center}}</ref>\n\nWhistles are used for communication, and four- to six-month-old calves develop unique sounds that they use most frequently throughout their lives. Such \"signature whistles\" are distinctive to the individual and may serve as a form of identification among other odontocetes.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\"/> Though a large pod of dolphins will produce a wide range of different noises, very little is known about the meaning of the sound. Frankel quotes one researcher who says listening to a school of odontocetes is like listening to a group of children at a school playground.<ref name=Frankel>Frankel, Adam S. \"Sound production\", ''Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals'', 1998, pp. 1126\u20131137. {{ISBN|0-12-551340-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe multiple sounds odontocetes make are produced by passing air through a structure in the head called the '''phonic lips'''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cranford|first=Ted W.|last2=Elsberry|first2=Wesley R.|last3=Bonn|first3=William G.

The base units of the song (sometimes loosely called the \"[[note (music)|notes]]\") are single uninterrupted emissions of sound that last up to a few seconds. These sounds vary in frequency from 20&nbsp;Hz to upward of 24&nbsp;kHz (the typical human range of hearing is 20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz). The units may be [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] (i.e., the pitch of the sound may go up, down, or stay the same during the note) or [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (get louder or quieter). However, the adjustment of bandwidth on a spectrogram representation of the song reveals the essentially [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulsed]] nature of the FM sounds.\n\nA collection of four or six units is known as a sub-[[phrase]], lasting perhaps ten seconds (see also [[phrase (music)]]).<ref name=Frankel/> A collection of two sub-phrases is a phrase. A whale will typically repeat the same phrase over and over for two to four minutes. This is known as a theme.

Westview Press.</ref>\n\nThe mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of [[cetaceans]] to another. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as whales, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, are much more dependent on sound for communication and sensation than are land mammals, because other senses are of limited effectiveness in water. [[Visual perception|Sight]] is less effective for marine mammals because of the particulate way in which the ocean scatters [[light]]. [[Olfaction|Smell]] is also limited, as [[molecule]]s diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. However, the [[speed of sound]] is roughly four times greater in water than in the atmosphere at [[sea level]]. Because sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and [[cetology|cetologists]] are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased [[ambient noise]] in the world's oceans caused by [[ship]]s, [[sonar]] and marine seismic surveys.<ref name=\"Melc\u00f3n2012\"/>\n\nThe word \"[[song]]\" is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the [[humpback whale]]. This is included with or in comparison with [[music]], and male humpback whales have been described as \"inveterate [[composers]]\" of songs that are \"'strikingly similar' to human musical traditions\".<ref>Payne Roger, quoted in: Author(s): Susan Milius. \"Music without Borders\", p. 253.

Within the larynx, when the [[vocal cords]] are brought close together, the passing air will force them to alternately close and open, separating the continuous airstream into discrete pulses of air that are heard as a vibration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dosits.org/animals/soundproduction/mammalsproduce/ |date=July 2009 |title=How do marine mammals produce sounds? |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref> This vibration is further modified by [[speech organs]] in the [[mouth|oral]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal]] cavities, creating sounds which are used in [[human voice|human speech]].\n\nCetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans:&nbsp;the&nbsp;''Odontoceti''&nbsp;([[toothed whales]]\u2014including dolphins) and the ''Mysticeti'' ([[baleen whale]]s\u2014including the largest whales, such as the [[blue whale]]).\n\n===Odontocete whales ===\n[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|left|Process in a dolphin echolocation: in green the sounds generated by the dolphin, in red from the fish.]]\n[[Image:Dolphin head.svg|300px|thumb|alt=Outline of what's inside a dolphin head. The skull is to the rear of the head, with the jaw bones extending narrowly forward to the nose. The anterior bursa occupies most of the upper front of the head, ahead of the skull and above the jaw. A network of air passages run from the upper roof of the mouth, past the back of the anterior bursa, to the [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]]. The posterior bursa is a small region behind the air passages, opposite the anterior bursa. Small phonic tips connect the bursa regions to the air passages.|Idealized dolphin head showing the regions involved in sound production. This image was redrawn from Cranford (2000).]]\nOdontocetes produce rapid bursts of high-frequency clicks that are thought to be primarily for [[animal echolocation|echolocation]]. Specialized organs in an odontocete produce collections of clicks and buzzes at frequencies from 0.2 to 150&nbsp;kHz to obtain sonic information about its environment. Lower frequencies are used for distance echolocation, due to the fact that shorter wavelengths do not travel as far as longer wavelengths underwater. Higher frequencies are more effective at shorter distances, and can reveal more detailed information about a target. Echoes from clicks convey, not only the distance to the target, but also the size, shape, speed, and vector of its movement. Additionally, echolocation allows the odontocete to easily discern the difference between objects that are different in material composition, even if visually identical, by their different densities. Individuals also appear to be able to isolate their own echoes during pod feeding activity without interference from other pod members' echolocations.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_acoustics.php|title=Page not found - Dolphin Research Center|author=|date=|website=Dolphin Research Center}}</ref>\n\nWhistles are used for communication, and four- to six-month-old calves develop unique sounds that they use most frequently throughout their lives. Such \"signature whistles\" are distinctive to the individual and may serve as a form of identification among other odontocetes.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\"/> Though a large pod of dolphins will produce a wide range of different noises, very little is known about the meaning of the sound. Frankel quotes one researcher who says listening to a school of odontocetes is like listening to a group of children at a school playground.<ref name=Frankel>Frankel, Adam S. \"Sound production\", ''Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals'', 1998, pp. 1126\u20131137. {{ISBN|0-12-551340-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe multiple sounds odontocetes make are produced by passing air through a structure in the head called the '''phonic lips'''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cranford|first=Ted W.|last2=Elsberry|first2=Wesley R.|last3=Bonn|first3=William G.

The base units of the song (sometimes loosely called the \"[[note (music)|notes]]\") are single uninterrupted emissions of sound that last up to a few seconds.
