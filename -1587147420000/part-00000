He developed a preference for bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[The Who]], [[Iron Maiden]], and [[The Beatles]], among many others. Portnoy claims to be self-taught as a drummer, though he did take [[music theory]] classes in [[high school]].

And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++. Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability.

And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++. Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability.

One team is shown a fill-in-the-blank and its top seven answers, with the first letter of each word in each correct answer being shown as a clue. For example, if the question is \"When I think of [[Italy]], I think of [blank],\" an answer might be \"L______ T____\" for [[Leaning Tower of Pisa | Leaning Tower]].\n\nIn the first round, each team is given one question. The team has a total of 30 seconds to guess all seven answers correctly. The first player offers an answer, and keeps giving answers until giving an answer that is not on the board, at which point control passes to the next player in line. This process continues (going back to the beginning of the line as often as necessary) until either all seven answers are given or time runs out. The team is awarded 100 points for every correct answer, and a 1,000-point bonus (1,700 total) if they can get all seven answers within the 30 seconds. Along the way, players must answer in turn; giving an answer out of turn\u2014including before the previous player's answer is ruled incorrect\u2014results in a five-second penalty (and the answer being disregarded). If the team cannot guess all seven, then the opposing team is given a chance to steal the remaining answers at 100 points each. Steal attempts are untimed, but end when either the board is completed or the stealing team gives an incorrect answer. Synonyms and word forms are acceptable if they correctly fill in the same blank(s) (for example, \"chefs\" and \"cooking\" would both be acceptable for \"cooks,\" but \"physician\" would not be acceptable for \"doctor\").\n\nFor the second round the order of play is reversed but the round is otherwise played the same way, with 200 points given for each correct answer and a 2,000-point bonus for all seven. In the third round, which is played for 300 points per answer and 3,000 bonus points for all seven, the team that is leading after the second round plays first - in case of a tie at this point, the round starts with team that started the game. The team with the most points after all three rounds wins $1,000 and the chance to play for $15,000 in the bonus round.\n\nBecause the leading team starts the third round, it has the opportunity to mathematically clinch victory before the trailing team has an opportunity to play its turn. In all cases, the third round immediately ends the moment the trailing team is [[mathematical elimination|mathematically eliminated]] from at least tying the leading team, which can happen when:\n\n* The leading team gives seven correct answers during its turn, thus scoring 5,100 points;\n* The leading team gives enough correct answers during its turn that the trailing team, even if it steals all remaining answers, cannot reduce the lead to less than 5,200 points;\n* The trailing team is still trailing by at least 5,200 points after an unsuccessful steal attempt;\n* The trailing team is still trailing after completing its turn;\n* The trailing team gives seven correct answers during its turn, thus scoring 5,100 points;\n* The trailing team gives enough correct answers during its turn to take a sufficiently large lead that the team originally leading cannot at least tie the game by stealing;\n* The originally leading team unsuccessfully attempts to steal while trailing;\n* The originally leading team re-takes the lead through stealing;\n\nIn the event of a tie after the third round, a tiebreaker is played between the team captains. The first letter of the top answer is shown, and then the question is shown. The first captain to buzz in is given the chance to answer. If the answer given is correct, that captain wins the game for his or her team. If the answer given is incorrect, then the other team wins automatically.\n\n=== Bonus round ===\nIn the Bonus Round, the winning team has 60 seconds to get the top answers to four more survey questions. The players are lined up in their same order around a central console with a large red Pass Button. Play starts again with the Team Captain, and is similar to the Main Game: a correct guess allows the player to give another answer, a wrong answer passes control to the next player in line.\n\nFor the first survey question, only the top answer is needed, the second needs the top two answers, the third needs the top three answers, and the final question needs the top four answers.\n\nIf a team member feels they are stuck on a question, they can hit the Pass Button (which stops the clock) and skip to the next question. They must return to the passed question once completing the other three in order to win the Bonus. The Pass Button can only be used once during the Bonus Round, and cannot be used once three of the four questions are completed (as there is no other question with which to pass).\n\nPlayers must wait until it is their turn before offering an answer. If a player offers an answer out of turn, the team loses five seconds from their clock.\n\nOnce all the needed answers for each question are correctly guessed, the clock stops and the next question is revealed. The guessing for each subsequent question begins with the player next in line (i.e. if Player 2 gave the last correct answer for a question, the next question's guessing starts with Player 3).\n\nIf the team can give all ten correct answers before time runs out, they win $15,000. If they cannot, they leave with just the $1,000 won in the Main Game.\n\nOn October 29, 2019, \"The Canadians\" (Ayumi Iizuka, Doug Morency, David Ivkovic, and Paul 'PK' Kingston) became the first team to complete a perfect game, amassing 10,400 points in 3 perfect rounds of 1,700, 3,400, and 5,100 points (plus a 200 point steal), and winning the bonus round.\n\n==Reception==\n''America Says'' raised Game Show Network's ratings by 26% over its time slot lead-in, and its women 25-54 ratings by more than 40%.<ref name=GSN /> \n\n''Stars & Celebs'' journalist Bradley Clarke described the series as \"GSN's newest mediocre game show,\" criticizing the low prize money and calling the format \"basically ''[[Family Feud]]'' but without the ''Family Feud'' charm\" as well as stating that the point system \"makes absolutely no sense.\" Clarke did concede that \"the game itself is somewhat fun to play along with.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecelebritycafe.com/2018/06/america-says-is-gsns-newest-mediocre-game-show/|title=''America Says'' is GSN's newest mediocre game show|work=The Celebrity Cafe|last=Clarke|first=Bradley|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHiggins was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] at the [[46th Daytime Emmy Awards]].<ref name=\"NATAS 2019\">{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/daytime-46th-nominations-release-no-credits.pdf|title=The 46th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Nominations |publisher=emmyonline.org and National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2019|year=2019|location=New York |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Family Feud]]''-similar in content\n*[[2018 in television]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/}}\n* {{IMDb title|8305258|America Says}}\n* [https://www.sidereel.com/tv-shows/america-says ''America Says'' on SideReel]\n{{italic title}}\n{{Game Show Network|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2018 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Game Show Network original programming]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = America Says\n| image                    = America Says Logo.jpg\n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = [[Game show]]\n| creator                  = {{Plainlist|\n* Cleve Keller\n* Dave Noll\n}}\n| based_on                 = \n| developer                = \n| writer                   = \n| director                 = Hal Grant\n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = [[John Michael Higgins]]\n| starring                 = \n| judges                   = \n| voices                   = \n| narrated                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 3\n| num_episodes             = 320 \n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Tara Long \n* Mark Herwick\n* Dave Noll\n* Cleve Keller\n* John Quinn\n* Jeffery Breeder\n}}\n| producer                 = \n| editor                   = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = 20-22 minutes\n| company                  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Entertainment One]]\n* [[Keller Noll]]\n}}\n| distributor              = \n| network                  = [[Game Show Network]]\n| channel                  = [[Game Show Network]]\n| picture_format           = 16:9\n| audio_format             = \n| first_run                = \n| released                 = \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2018|6|18}} <ref>[https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Actor-John-Michael-Higgins-Named-as-Host-of-Game-Show-Networks-New-Survey-Based-Show-AMERICA-SAYS-20180516 Actor John Michael Higgins Named as Host of Game Show Network's New Survey-Based Show, AMERICA SAYS-BroadwayWorld TV]</ref>\n| last_aired               = {{End date|present}}\n| preceded_by              = \n| followed_by              = \n| related                  = \n| website                  = https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/\n| website_title            = Official website\n| production_website       = \n}}\n'''''America Says''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American television]] [[game show]] hosted by [[John Michael Higgins]] and broadcast by [[Game Show Network]].

If they cannot, they leave with just the $1,000 won in the Main Game.\n\nOn October 29, 2019, \"The Canadians\" (Ayumi Iizuka, Doug Morency, David Ivkovic, and Paul 'PK' Kingston) became the first team to complete a perfect game, amassing 10,400 points in 3 perfect rounds of 1,700, 3,400, and 5,100 points (plus a 200 point steal), and winning the bonus round.\n\n==Reception==\n''America Says'' raised Game Show Network's ratings by 26% over its time slot lead-in, and its women 25-54 ratings by more than 40%.<ref name=GSN /> \n\n''Stars & Celebs'' journalist Bradley Clarke described the series as \"GSN's newest mediocre game show,\" criticizing the low prize money and calling the format \"basically ''[[Family Feud]]'' but without the ''Family Feud'' charm\" as well as stating that the point system \"makes absolutely no sense.\" Clarke did concede that \"the game itself is somewhat fun to play along with.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecelebritycafe.com/2018/06/america-says-is-gsns-newest-mediocre-game-show/|title=''America Says'' is GSN's newest mediocre game show|work=The Celebrity Cafe|last=Clarke|first=Bradley|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHiggins was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] at the [[46th Daytime Emmy Awards]].<ref name=\"NATAS 2019\">{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/daytime-46th-nominations-release-no-credits.pdf|title=The 46th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Nominations |publisher=emmyonline.org and National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2019|year=2019|location=New York |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Family Feud]]''-similar in content\n*[[2018 in television]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/}}\n* {{IMDb title|8305258|America Says}}\n* [https://www.sidereel.com/tv-shows/america-says ''America Says'' on SideReel]\n{{italic title}}\n{{Game Show Network|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2018 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Game Show Network original programming]]\n", "name_user": "Rupertslander", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGameplay", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Says"}

This was the first linear-time algorithm for string matching.\n\n==Background==\nA string-matching algorithm wants to find the starting index <code>m</code> in string <code>S[]</code> that matches the search word <code>W[]</code>.\n\nThe most straightforward algorithm, known as the \"[[Brute-force search|Brute-force]]\" or \"Naive\" algorithm, is to look for a word match at each index <code>m</code>, the position in the string being searched, i.e. <code>S[m]</code>. At each position <code>m</code> the algorithm first checks for equality of the first character in the word being searched, i.e. <code>S[m] =? W[0]</code>. If a match is found, the algorithm tests the other characters in the word being searched by checking successive values of the word position index, <code>i</code>. The algorithm retrieves the character <code>W[i]</code> in the word being searched and checks for equality of the expression <code>S[m+i] =? W[i]</code>.  If all successive characters match in <code>W</code> at position <code>m</code>, then a match is found at that position in the search string. If the index <code>m</code> reaches the end of the string then there is no match, in which case the search is said to \"fail\".\n\nUsually, the trial check will quickly reject the trial match. If the strings are uniformly distributed random letters, then the chance that characters match is 1 in 26. In most cases, the trial check will reject the match at the initial letter. The chance that the first two letters will match is 1 in 26<sup>2</sup> (1 in 676). So if the characters are random, then the expected complexity of searching string <code>S[]</code> of length ''n'' is on the order of ''n'' comparisons or ''O''(''n'').  The expected performance is very good. If <code>S[]</code> is 1 million characters and <code>W[]</code> is 1000 characters, then the string search should complete after about 1.04 million character comparisons.\n\nThat expected performance is not guaranteed. If the strings are not random, then checking a trial <code>m</code> may take many character comparisons. The worst case is if the two strings match in all but the last letter. Imagine that the string <code>S[]</code> consists of 1 million characters that are all ''A'', and that the word <code>W[]</code> is 999 ''A'' characters terminating in a final ''B'' character. The simple string-matching algorithm will now examine 1000 characters at each trial position before rejecting the match and advancing the trial position. The simple string search example would now take about 1000 character comparisons times 1 million positions for 1 billion character comparisons.  If the length of <code>W[]</code> is ''k'', then the worst-case performance is ''O''(''k''&sdot;''n'').\n\nThe KMP algorithm has a better worst-case performance than the straightforward algorithm. KMP spends a little time precomputing a table (on the order of the size of <code>W[]</code>, ''O''(''k'')), and then it uses that table to do an efficient search of the string in ''O''(''n'').\n\nThe difference is that KMP makes use of previous match information that the straightforward algorithm does not. In the example above, when KMP sees a trial match fail on the 1000th character (<code>i</code> = 999) because <code>S[m+999] \u2260 W[999]</code>, it will increment <code>m</code> by 1, but it will know that the first 998 characters at the new position already match.  KMP matched 999 ''A'' characters before discovering a mismatch at the 1000th character (position 999). Advancing the trial match position <code>m</code> by one throws away the first ''A'', so KMP knows there are 998 ''A'' characters that match <code>W[]</code> and does not retest them; that is, KMP sets <code>i</code> to 998. KMP maintains its knowledge in the precomputed table and two state variables. When KMP discovers a mismatch, the table determines how much KMP will increase (variable <code>m</code>) and where it will resume testing (variable <code>i</code>).\n\n==KMP algorithm==\n\n===Example of the search algorithm===\nTo illustrate the algorithm's details, consider a (relatively artificial) run of the algorithm, where <code>W</code> = \"ABCDABD\" and <code>S</code> = \"ABC ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE\". At any given time, the algorithm is in a state determined by two integers:\n\n* <code>m</code>, denoting the position within <code>S</code> where the prospective match for <code>W</code> begins,\n* <code>i</code>, denoting the index of the currently considered character in <code>W</code>.\n\nIn each step the algorithm compares <code>S[m+i]</code> with <code>W[i]</code> and increments <code>i</code> if they are equal. This is depicted, at the start of the run, like\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: {{color|blue|ABC}}{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W: {{color|blue|ABC}}{{color|red|D}}{{color|gray|ABD}}\n i: {{color|blue|012}}{{color|red|3}}{{color|gray|456}}\n</div>\n\nThe algorithm compares successive characters of <code>W</code> to \"parallel\" characters of <code>S</code>, moving from one to the next by incrementing <code>i</code> if they match.  However, in the fourth step <code>S[3]&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;'</code> does not match <code>W[3] = 'D'</code>.  Rather than beginning to search again at <code>S[1]</code>, we note that no <code>'A'</code> occurs between positions 1 and 2 in <code>S</code>; hence, having checked all those characters previously (and knowing they matched the corresponding characters in <code>W</code>), there is no chance of finding the beginning of a match.  Therefore, the algorithm sets <code>m = 3</code> and <code>i = 0</code>.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:    {{color|red|A}}{{color|gray|BCDABD}}\n i:    {{color|red|0}}{{color|gray|123456}}\n</div>\n\nThis match fails at the initial character, so the algorithm sets <code>m = 4</code> and <code>i = 0</code>\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:     {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red|D}}\n i:     {{color|blue|012345}}{{color|red|6}}\n</div>\n\nHere, <code>i</code> increments through a nearly complete match <code>\"ABCDAB\"</code> until <code>i = 6</code> giving a mismatch at <code>W[6]</code> and <code>S[10]</code>.  However, just prior to the end of the current partial match, there was that substring <code>\"AB\"</code> that could be the beginning of a new match, so the algorithm must take this into consideration.  As these characters match the two characters prior to the current position, those characters need not be checked again; the algorithm sets <code>m = 8</code> (the start of the initial prefix) and <code>i = 2</code> (signaling the first two characters match) and continues matching.  Thus the algorithm not only omits previously matched characters of <code>S</code> (the <code>\"AB\"</code>), but also previously matched characters of <code>W</code> (the prefix <code>\"AB\"</code>).\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCD{{color|gray|AB}}{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:         {{color|gray|AB}}{{color|red|C}}{{color|gray|DABD}}\n i:         {{color|gray|01}}{{color|red|2}}{{color|gray|3456}}\n</div>\n\nThis search at the new position fails immediately because <code>W[2]</code> (a <code>'C'</code>) does not match <code>S[10]</code> (a <code>'&nbsp;'</code>). As in the first trial, the mismatch causes the algorithm to return to the beginning of <code>W</code> and begins searching at the mismatched character position of <code>S</code>: <code>m = 10</code>, reset <code>i = 0</code>.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCDAB{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:           {{color|red|A}}{{color|gray|BCDABD}}\n i:           {{color|red|0}}{{color|gray|123456}}\n</div>\n\nThe match at <code>m=10</code> fails immediately, so the algorithm next tries <code>m = 11</code> and <code>i = 0</code>.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\"> \n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCDAB {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red|C}}{{color|gray|DABDE}}\n W:            {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red|D}}\n i:            {{color|blue|012345}}{{color|red|6}}\n</div>\n\nOnce again, the algorithm matches <code>\"ABCDAB\"</code>, but the next character, <code>'C'</code>, does not match the final character <code>'D'</code> of the word <code>W</code>.  Reasoning as before, the algorithm sets <code>m = 15</code>, to start at the two-character string <code>\"AB\"</code> leading up to the current position, set <code>i = 2</code>, and continue matching from the current position.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCDAB ABCD{{color|blue|ABCDABD}}{{color|gray|E}}\n W:                {{color|blue|ABCDABD}}\n i:                {{color|blue|0123456}}\n</div>\n\nThis time the match is complete, and the first character of the match is <code>S[15]</code>.\n\n===Description of pseudocode for the search algorithm===\n<!--Note to future editors: please do not replace or even supplement the pseudocode with language-specific code.  Following the WikiProject Computer Science manual of style, pseudocode is preferred over real code unless the real code illustrates a feature of the language or an implementation detail.  This algorithm is so simple that neither of these can ever be the case-->\nThe above example contains all the elements of the algorithm.  For the moment, we assume the existence of a \"partial match\" table <code>T</code>, described [[#\"Partial match\" table (also known as \"failure function\")|below]], which indicates where we need to look for the start of a new match in the event that the current one ends in a mismatch.  The entries of <code>T</code> are constructed so that if we have a match starting at <code>S[m]</code> that fails when comparing <code>S[m + i]</code> to <code>W[i]</code>, then the next possible match will start at index <code>m + i - T[i]</code> in <code>S</code> (that is, <code>T[i]</code> is the amount of \"backtracking\" we need to do after a mismatch).  This has two implications: first, <code>T[0] = -1</code>, which indicates that if <code>W[0]</code> is a mismatch, we cannot backtrack and must simply check the next character; and second, although the next possible match will ''begin'' at index <code>m + i - T[i]</code>, as in the example above, we need not actually check any of the <code>T[i]</code> characters after that, so that we continue searching from <code>W[T[i]]</code>.  The following is a sample [[pseudocode]] implementation of the KMP search algorithm.\n\n \n \n '''algorithm''' ''kmp_search'':\n     '''input''':\n         an array of characters, S (the text to be searched)\n         an array of characters, W (the word sought)\n     '''output''':\n         an array of integers, P (positions in S at which W is found)\n         an integer, nP (number of positions)\n \n     '''define variables''':\n         an integer, j \u2190 0 (the position of the current character in S)\n         an integer, k \u2190 0 (the position of the current character in W)\n         an array of integers, T (the table, computed elsewhere)\n \n     '''let''' nP \u2190 0\n \n     '''while''' j < length(S) '''do'''\n         '''if''' W[k] = S[j] '''then'''\n             '''let''' j \u2190 j + 1\n             '''let''' k \u2190 k + 1\n             '''if''' k = length(W) '''then'''\n                 (occurrence found, if only first occurrence is needed, m \u2190 j - k  may be returned here)\n                 '''let''' P[nP] \u2190 j - k, nP \u2190 nP + 1\n                 '''let''' k \u2190 T[k] (T[length(W)] can't be -1)\n         '''else'''\n             '''let''' k \u2190 T[k]\n             '''if''' k < 0 '''then'''\n                 '''let''' j \u2190 j + 1\n                 '''let''' k \u2190 k + 1\n\n===Efficiency of the search algorithm===\nAssuming the prior existence of the table <code>T</code>, the search portion of the Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm has [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] [[Linear time#Linear time|''O''(''n'')]], where ''n'' is the length of <code>S</code> and the ''O'' is [[big-O notation]].  Except for the fixed overhead incurred in entering and exiting the function, all the computations are performed in the <code>'''while'''</code> loop. To bound the number of iterations of this loop; observe that <code>T</code> is constructed so that if a match which had begun at <code>S[m]</code> fails while comparing <code>S[m + i]</code> to <code>W[i]</code>, then the next possible match must begin at <code>S[m + (i - T[i])]</code>.  In particular, the next possible match must occur at a higher index than <code>m</code>, so that <code>T[i] < i</code>.\n\nThis fact implies that the loop can execute at most 2''n'' times, since at each iteration it executes one of the two branches in the loop.  The first branch invariably increases <code>i</code> and does not change <code>m</code>, so that the index <code>m + i</code> of the currently scrutinized character of <code>S</code> is increased.  The second branch adds <code>i - T[i]</code> to <code>m</code>, and as we have seen, this is always a positive number.  Thus the location <code>m</code> of the beginning of the current potential match is increased. At the same time, the second branch leaves <code>m + i</code> unchanged, for <code>m</code> gets <code>i - T[i]</code> added to it, and immediately after <code>T[i]</code> gets assigned as the new value of <code>i</code>, hence <code>new_m + new_i =  old_m + old_i - T[old_i] + T[old_i] = old_m + old_i</code>. Now, the loop ends if <code>m + i</code> = ''n''; therefore, each branch of the loop can be reached at most ''n'' times, since they respectively increase either <code>m + i</code> or <code>m</code>, and <code>m \u2264 m + i</code>: if <code>m</code> = ''n'', then certainly <code>m + i</code> \u2265 ''n'', so that since it increases by unit increments at most, we must have had <code>m + i</code> = ''n'' at some point in the past, and therefore either way we would be done.\n\nThus the loop executes at most 2''n'' times, showing that the time complexity of the search algorithm is ''O''(''n'').\n\nHere is another way to think about the runtime:\nLet us say we begin to match <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> at position <code>i</code> and <code>p</code>. If <code>W</code> exists as a substring of <code>S</code> at p, then <code>W[0..m] = S[p..p+m]</code>.\nUpon success, that is, the word and the text matched at the positions (<code>W[i] = S[p+i]</code>), we increase <code>i</code> by 1.\nUpon failure, that is, the word and the text do not match at the positions (<code>W[i] \u2260 S[p+i]</code>), the text pointer is kept still, while the word pointer is rolled back a certain amount (<code>i = T[i]</code>, where <code>T</code> is the jump table), and we attempt to match <code>W[T[i]]</code> with <code>S[p+i]</code>.\nThe maximum number of roll-back of <code>i</code> is bounded by <code>i</code>, that is to say, for any failure, we can only roll back as much as we have progressed up to the failure.\nThen it is clear the runtime is 2''n''.\n\n==\"Partial match\" table (also known as \"failure function\")==\nThe goal of the table is to allow the algorithm not to match any character of <code>S</code> more than once.  The key observation about the nature of a linear search that allows this to happen is that in having checked some segment of the main string against an ''initial segment'' of the pattern, we know exactly at which places a new potential match which could continue to the current position could begin prior to the current position.  In other words, we \"pre-search\" the pattern itself and compile a list of all possible fallback positions that bypass a maximum of hopeless characters while not sacrificing any potential matches in doing so.\n\nWe want to be able to look up, for each position in <code>W</code>, the length of the longest possible initial segment of <code>W</code> leading up to (but not including) that position, other than the full segment starting at <code>W[0]</code> that just failed to match; this is how far we have to backtrack in finding the next match.  Hence <code>T[i]</code> is exactly the length of the longest possible ''proper'' initial segment of <code>W</code> which is also a segment of the substring ending at <code>W[i - 1]</code>.  We use the convention that the empty string has length 0.  Since a mismatch at the very start of the pattern is a special case (there is no possibility of backtracking), we set <code>T[0] = -1</code>, as discussed [[#Description of pseudocode for the table-building algorithm|below]].\n\n===Working example of the table-building algorithm===\nWe consider the example of <code>W = \"ABCDABD\"</code> first.  We will see that it follows much the same pattern as the main search, and is efficient for similar reasons.  We set <code>T[0] = -1</code>.  To find <code>T[1]</code>, we must discover a [[Substring#Suffix|proper suffix]] of <code>\"A\"</code> which is also a prefix of pattern <code>W</code>.  But there are no proper suffixes of <code>\"A\"</code>, so we set <code>T[1] = 0</code>. To find <code>T[2]</code>, we see that the substring <code>W[0]</code> - <code>W[1]</code> (<code>\"AB\"</code>) has a proper suffix <code>\"B\"</code>. However \"B\" is not a prefix of the pattern <code>W</code>. Therefore, we set <code>T[2] = 0</code>.\n\nContinuing to <code>T[3]</code>, we first check the proper suffix of length 1, and as in the previous case it fails. Should we also check longer suffixes? No, we now note that there is a shortcut to checking ''all'' suffixes: let us say that we discovered a [[Substring#Suffix|proper suffix]] which is a [[Substring#Prefix|proper prefix]] (A proper prefix of a string is not equal to the string itself) and ending at <code>W[2]</code> with length 2 (the maximum possible); then its first character is also a proper prefix of <code>W</code>, hence a proper prefix itself, and it ends at <code>W[1]</code>, which we already determined did not occur as <code>T[2] = 0</code> and not <code>T[2] = 1</code>. Hence at each stage, the shortcut rule is that one needs to consider checking suffixes of a given size m+1 only if a valid suffix of size m was found at the previous stage (i.e. <code>T[x] = m</code>) and should not bother to check m+2, m+3, etc.\n\nTherefore, we need not even concern ourselves with substrings having length 2, and as in the previous case the sole one with length 1 fails, so <code>T[3] = 0</code>.\n\nWe pass to the subsequent <code>W[4]</code>, <code>'A'</code>.  The same logic shows that the longest substring we need to consider has length 1, and as in the previous case it fails since \"D\" is not a prefix of <code>W</code>. But instead of setting <code>T[4] = 0</code>, we can do better by noting that <code>W[4] = W[0]</code>, and also that a look-up of <code>T[4]</code> implies the corresponding <code>S</code> character, <code>S[m+4]</code>, was a mismatch and therefore <code>S[m+4] \u2260 'A'</code>. Thus there is no point in restarting the search at <code>S[m+4]</code>; we should begin at 1 position ahead. This means that we may shift pattern <code>W</code> by match length plus one character, so <code>T[4] = -1</code>.\n\nConsidering now the next character, <code>W[5]</code>, which is <code>'B'</code>: though by inspection the longest substring would appear to be <code>'A'</code>, we still set <code>T[5] = 0</code>. The reasoning is similar to why <code>T[4] = -1</code>. <code>W[5]</code> itself extends the prefix match begun with <code>W[4]</code>, and we can assume that the corresponding character in <code>S</code>, <code>S[m+5] \u2260 'B'</code>. So backtracking before <code>W[5]</code> is pointless, but <code>S[m+5]</code> may be <code>'A'</code>, hence <code>T[5] = 0</code>.\n\nFinally, we see that the next character in the ongoing segment starting at <code>W[4] = 'A'</code> would be <code>'B'</code>, and indeed this is also <code>W[5]</code>.  Furthermore, the same argument as above shows that we need not look before <code>W[4]</code> to find a segment for <code>W[6]</code>, so that this is it, and we take <code>T[6] = 2</code>.\n\nTherefore, we compile the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| A\n| B\n| C\n| D\n| A\n| B\n| D\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| -1\n| 0\n| 2\n| 0\n|}\n\nAnother example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| C\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| B\n| C\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 1\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 3\n| 2\n| 0\n|}\n\nAnother example (slightly changed from the previous example):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| C\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| B\n| A\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 1\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 3\n| -1\n| 3\n|}\n\nAnother more complicated example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 00\n| 01\n| 02\n| 03\n| 04\n| 05\n| 06\n| 07\n| 08\n| 09\n| 10\n| 11\n| 12\n| 13\n| 14\n| 15\n| 16\n| 17\n| 18\n| 19\n| 20\n| 21\n| 22\n| 23\n| 24\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| P\n| A\n| R\n| T\n| I\n| C\n| I\n| P\n| A\n| T\n| E\n|\n| I\n| N\n| \n| P\n| A\n| R\n| A\n| C\n| H\n| U\n| T\n| E\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| -1\n| 0\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| -1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 3\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|}\n\n===Description of pseudocode for the table-building algorithm===\n<!--Note to future editors: please do not replace or even supplement the pseudocode with language-specific code.  Following the WikiProject Computer Sscience manual of style, pseudocode is preferred over real code unless the real code illustrates a feature of the language or an implementation detail.

The KMP table has bigger shifts. See http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node8.html-->\nThe example above illustrates the general technique for assembling the table with a minimum of fuss.  The principle is that of the overall search: most of the work was already done in getting to the current position, so very little needs to be done in leaving it.  The only minor complication is that the logic which is correct late in the string erroneously gives non-proper substrings at the beginning.  This necessitates some initialization code.\n \n '''algorithm''' ''kmp_table'':\n     '''input''':\n         an array of characters, W (the word to be analyzed)\n     '''output''':\n         an array of integers, T (the table to be filled)\n \n     '''define variables''':\n         an integer, pos \u2190 1 (the current position we are computing in T)\n         an integer, cnd \u2190 0 (the zero-based index in W of the next character of the current candidate substring)\n \n     '''let''' T[0] \u2190 -1\n \n     '''while''' pos < length(W) '''do'''\n         '''if''' W[pos] = W[cnd] '''then'''\n             '''let''' T[pos] \u2190 T[cnd]\n         '''else'''\n             '''let''' T[pos] \u2190 cnd\n             '''let''' cnd \u2190 T[cnd] (to increase performance)\n             '''while''' cnd \u2265 0 '''and''' W[pos] <> W[cnd] '''do'''\n                 '''let''' cnd \u2190 T[cnd]\n         '''let''' pos \u2190 pos + 1, cnd \u2190 cnd + 1\n \n     '''let''' T[pos] \u2190 cnd (only need when all word occurrences searched)\n\n===Efficiency of the table-building algorithm===\nThe complexity of the table algorithm is <code>O(k)</code>, where <code>k</code> is the length of <code>W</code>.  As except for some initialization all the work is done in the <code>'''while'''</code> loop, it is sufficient to show that this loop executes in <code>O(k)</code> time, which will be done by simultaneously examining the quantities <code>pos</code> and <code>pos - cnd</code>.  In the first branch, <code>pos - cnd</code> is preserved, as both <code>pos</code> and <code>cnd</code> are incremented simultaneously, but naturally, <code>pos</code> is increased.  In the second branch, <code>cnd</code> is replaced by <code>T[cnd]</code>, which we saw [[#Efficiency of the search algorithm|above]] is always strictly less than <code>cnd</code>, thus increasing <code>pos - cnd</code>. Since <code>pos &ge; pos - cnd</code>, this means that at each stage either <code>pos</code> or a lower bound for <code>pos</code> increases; therefore since the algorithm terminates once <code>pos = k</code>, it must terminate after at most <code>2k</code> iterations of the loop, since <code>pos - cnd</code> begins at <code>1</code>.  Therefore, the complexity of the table algorithm is <code>O(k)</code>.\n\n==Efficiency of the KMP algorithm==\nSince the two portions of the algorithm have, respectively, complexities of <code>O(k)</code> and <code>O(n)</code>, the complexity of the overall algorithm is <code>O(n + k)</code>.\n\nThese complexities are the same, no matter how many repetitive patterns are in <code>W</code> or <code>S</code>.\n\n==Variants==\nA [[Real-time computing|real-time]] version of KMP can be implemented using a separate failure function table for each character in the alphabet. If a mismatch occurs on character <math>x</math> in the text, the failure function table for character <math>x</math> is consulted for the index <math>i</math> in the pattern at which the mismatch took place. This will return the length of the longest substring ending at <math>i</math> matching a prefix of the pattern, with the added condition that the character after the prefix is <math>x</math>. With this restriction, character <math>x</math> in the text need not be checked again in the next phase, and so only a constant number of operations are executed between the processing of each index of the text{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. This satisfies the real-time computing restriction.\n\nThe [[Lexicographically_minimal_string_rotation#Booth's_Algorithm|Booth's algorithm]] uses a modified version of the KMP preprocessing function to find the [[lexicographically minimal string rotation]]. The failure function is progressively calculated as the string is rotated.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | first1=Thomas | last1=Cormen | author1-link=Thomas H.

This was the first linear-time algorithm for string matching.\n\n==Background==\nA string-matching algorithm wants to find the starting index <code>m</code> in string <code>S[]</code> that matches the search word <code>W[]</code>.\n\nThe most straightforward algorithm, known as the \"[[Brute-force search|Brute-force]]\" or \"Naive\" algorithm, is to look for a word match at each index <code>m</code>, the position in the string being searched, i.e. <code>S[m]</code>. At each position <code>m</code> the algorithm first checks for equality of the first character in the word being searched, i.e. <code>S[m] =? W[0]</code>. If a match is found, the algorithm tests the other characters in the word being searched by checking successive values of the word position index, <code>i</code>. The algorithm retrieves the character <code>W[i]</code> in the word being searched and checks for equality of the expression <code>S[m+i] =? W[i]</code>.  If all successive characters match in <code>W</code> at position <code>m</code>, then a match is found at that position in the search string. If the index <code>m</code> reaches the end of the string then there is no match, in which case the search is said to \"fail\".\n\nUsually, the trial check will quickly reject the trial match. If the strings are uniformly distributed random letters, then the chance that characters match is 1 in 26. In most cases, the trial check will reject the match at the initial letter. The chance that the first two letters will match is 1 in 26<sup>2</sup> (1 in 676). So if the characters are random, then the expected complexity of searching string <code>S[]</code> of length ''k'' is on the order of ''k'' comparisons or ''O''(''k'').  The expected performance is very good. If <code>S[]</code> is 1 million characters and <code>W[]</code> is 1000 characters, then the string search should complete after about 1.04 million character comparisons.\n\nThat expected performance is not guaranteed. If the strings are not random, then checking a trial <code>m</code> may take many character comparisons. The worst case is if the two strings match in all but the last letter. Imagine that the string <code>S[]</code> consists of 1 million characters that are all ''A'', and that the word <code>W[]</code> is 999 ''A'' characters terminating in a final ''B'' character. The simple string-matching algorithm will now examine 1000 characters at each trial position before rejecting the match and advancing the trial position. The simple string search example would now take about 1000 character comparisons times 1 million positions for 1 billion character comparisons.  If the length of <code>W[]</code> is ''n'', then the worst-case performance is ''O''(''k''&sdot;''n'').\n\nThe KMP algorithm has a better worst-case performance than the straightforward algorithm. KMP spends a little time precomputing a table (on the order of the size of <code>W[]</code>, ''O''(''n'')), and then it uses that table to do an efficient search of the string in ''O''(''k'').\n\nThe difference is that KMP makes use of previous match information that the straightforward algorithm does not. In the example above, when KMP sees a trial match fail on the 1000th character (<code>i</code> = 999) because <code>S[m+999] \u2260 W[999]</code>, it will increment <code>m</code> by 1, but it will know that the first 998 characters at the new position already match.  KMP matched 999 ''A'' characters before discovering a mismatch at the 1000th character (position 999). Advancing the trial match position <code>m</code> by one throws away the first ''A'', so KMP knows there are 998 ''A'' characters that match <code>W[]</code> and does not retest them; that is, KMP sets <code>i</code> to 998. KMP maintains its knowledge in the precomputed table and two state variables. When KMP discovers a mismatch, the table determines how much KMP will increase (variable <code>m</code>) and where it will resume testing (variable <code>i</code>).\n\n==KMP algorithm==\n\n===Example of the search algorithm===\nTo illustrate the algorithm's details, consider a (relatively artificial) run of the algorithm, where <code>W</code> = \"ABCDABD\" and <code>S</code> = \"ABC ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE\". At any given time, the algorithm is in a state determined by two integers:\n\n* <code>m</code>, denoting the position within <code>S</code> where the prospective match for <code>W</code> begins,\n* <code>i</code>, denoting the index of the currently considered character in <code>W</code>.\n\nIn each step the algorithm compares <code>S[m+i]</code> with <code>W[i]</code> and increments <code>i</code> if they are equal. This is depicted, at the start of the run, like\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: {{color|blue|ABC}}{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W: {{color|blue|ABC}}{{color|red|D}}{{color|gray|ABD}}\n i: {{color|blue|012}}{{color|red|3}}{{color|gray|456}}\n</div>\n\nThe algorithm compares successive characters of <code>W</code> to \"parallel\" characters of <code>S</code>, moving from one to the next by incrementing <code>i</code> if they match.  However, in the fourth step <code>S[3]&nbsp;=&nbsp;'&nbsp;'</code> does not match <code>W[3] = 'D'</code>.  Rather than beginning to search again at <code>S[1]</code>, we note that no <code>'A'</code> occurs between positions 1 and 2 in <code>S</code>; hence, having checked all those characters previously (and knowing they matched the corresponding characters in <code>W</code>), there is no chance of finding the beginning of a match.  Therefore, the algorithm sets <code>m = 3</code> and <code>i = 0</code>.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:    {{color|red|A}}{{color|gray|BCDABD}}\n i:    {{color|red|0}}{{color|gray|123456}}\n</div>\n\nThis match fails at the initial character, so the algorithm sets <code>m = 4</code> and <code>i = 0</code>\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:     {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red|D}}\n i:     {{color|blue|012345}}{{color|red|6}}\n</div>\n\nHere, <code>i</code> increments through a nearly complete match <code>\"ABCDAB\"</code> until <code>i = 6</code> giving a mismatch at <code>W[6]</code> and <code>S[10]</code>.  However, just prior to the end of the current partial match, there was that substring <code>\"AB\"</code> that could be the beginning of a new match, so the algorithm must take this into consideration.  As these characters match the two characters prior to the current position, those characters need not be checked again; the algorithm sets <code>m = 8</code> (the start of the initial prefix) and <code>i = 2</code> (signaling the first two characters match) and continues matching.  Thus the algorithm not only omits previously matched characters of <code>S</code> (the <code>\"AB\"</code>), but also previously matched characters of <code>W</code> (the prefix <code>\"AB\"</code>).\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCD{{color|gray|AB}}{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:         {{color|gray|AB}}{{color|red|C}}{{color|gray|DABD}}\n i:         {{color|gray|01}}{{color|red|2}}{{color|gray|3456}}\n</div>\n\nThis search at the new position fails immediately because <code>W[2]</code> (a <code>'C'</code>) does not match <code>S[10]</code> (a <code>'&nbsp;'</code>). As in the first trial, the mismatch causes the algorithm to return to the beginning of <code>W</code> and begins searching at the mismatched character position of <code>S</code>: <code>m = 10</code>, reset <code>i = 0</code>.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCDAB{{color|red| }}{{color|gray|ABCDABCDABDE}}\n W:           {{color|red|A}}{{color|gray|BCDABD}}\n i:           {{color|red|0}}{{color|gray|123456}}\n</div>\n\nThe match at <code>m=10</code> fails immediately, so the algorithm next tries <code>m = 11</code> and <code>i = 0</code>.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\"> \n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCDAB {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red|C}}{{color|gray|DABDE}}\n W:            {{color|blue|ABCDAB}}{{color|red|D}}\n i:            {{color|blue|012345}}{{color|red|6}}\n</div>\n\nOnce again, the algorithm matches <code>\"ABCDAB\"</code>, but the next character, <code>'C'</code>, does not match the final character <code>'D'</code> of the word <code>W</code>.  Reasoning as before, the algorithm sets <code>m = 15</code>, to start at the two-character string <code>\"AB\"</code> leading up to the current position, set <code>i = 2</code>, and continue matching from the current position.\n\n<div style=\"font-family:monospace;\">\n              1         2  \n m: 01234567890123456789012\n S: ABC ABCDAB ABCD{{color|blue|ABCDABD}}{{color|gray|E}}\n W:                {{color|blue|ABCDABD}}\n i:                {{color|blue|0123456}}\n</div>\n\nThis time the match is complete, and the first character of the match is <code>S[15]</code>.\n\n===Description of pseudocode for the search algorithm===\n<!--Note to future editors: please do not replace or even supplement the pseudocode with language-specific code.  Following the WikiProject Computer Science manual of style, pseudocode is preferred over real code unless the real code illustrates a feature of the language or an implementation detail.  This algorithm is so simple that neither of these can ever be the case-->\nThe above example contains all the elements of the algorithm.  For the moment, we assume the existence of a \"partial match\" table <code>T</code>, described [[#\"Partial match\" table (also known as \"failure function\")|below]], which indicates where we need to look for the start of a new match in the event that the current one ends in a mismatch.  The entries of <code>T</code> are constructed so that if we have a match starting at <code>S[m]</code> that fails when comparing <code>S[m + i]</code> to <code>W[i]</code>, then the next possible match will start at index <code>m + i - T[i]</code> in <code>S</code> (that is, <code>T[i]</code> is the amount of \"backtracking\" we need to do after a mismatch).  This has two implications: first, <code>T[0] = -1</code>, which indicates that if <code>W[0]</code> is a mismatch, we cannot backtrack and must simply check the next character; and second, although the next possible match will ''begin'' at index <code>m + i - T[i]</code>, as in the example above, we need not actually check any of the <code>T[i]</code> characters after that, so that we continue searching from <code>W[T[i]]</code>.  The following is a sample [[pseudocode]] implementation of the KMP search algorithm.\n\n \n \n '''algorithm''' ''kmp_search'':\n     '''input''':\n         an array of characters, S (the text to be searched)\n         an array of characters, W (the word sought)\n     '''output''':\n         an array of integers, P (positions in S at which W is found)\n         an integer, nP (number of positions)\n \n     '''define variables''':\n         an integer, j \u2190 0 (the position of the current character in S)\n         an integer, k \u2190 0 (the position of the current character in W)\n         an array of integers, T (the table, computed elsewhere)\n \n     '''let''' nP \u2190 0\n \n     '''while''' j < length(S) '''do'''\n         '''if''' W[k] = S[j] '''then'''\n             '''let''' j \u2190 j + 1\n             '''let''' k \u2190 k + 1\n             '''if''' k = length(W) '''then'''\n                 (occurrence found, if only first occurrence is needed, m \u2190 j - k  may be returned here)\n                 '''let''' P[nP] \u2190 j - k, nP \u2190 nP + 1\n                 '''let''' k \u2190 T[k] (T[length(W)] can't be -1)\n         '''else'''\n             '''let''' k \u2190 T[k]\n             '''if''' k < 0 '''then'''\n                 '''let''' j \u2190 j + 1\n                 '''let''' k \u2190 k + 1\n\n===Efficiency of the search algorithm===\nAssuming the prior existence of the table <code>T</code>, the search portion of the Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm has [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] [[Linear time#Linear time|''O''(''n'')]], where ''n'' is the length of <code>S</code> and the ''O'' is [[big-O notation]].  Except for the fixed overhead incurred in entering and exiting the function, all the computations are performed in the <code>'''while'''</code> loop. To bound the number of iterations of this loop; observe that <code>T</code> is constructed so that if a match which had begun at <code>S[m]</code> fails while comparing <code>S[m + i]</code> to <code>W[i]</code>, then the next possible match must begin at <code>S[m + (i - T[i])]</code>.  In particular, the next possible match must occur at a higher index than <code>m</code>, so that <code>T[i] < i</code>.\n\nThis fact implies that the loop can execute at most 2''n'' times, since at each iteration it executes one of the two branches in the loop.  The first branch invariably increases <code>i</code> and does not change <code>m</code>, so that the index <code>m + i</code> of the currently scrutinized character of <code>S</code> is increased.  The second branch adds <code>i - T[i]</code> to <code>m</code>, and as we have seen, this is always a positive number.  Thus the location <code>m</code> of the beginning of the current potential match is increased. At the same time, the second branch leaves <code>m + i</code> unchanged, for <code>m</code> gets <code>i - T[i]</code> added to it, and immediately after <code>T[i]</code> gets assigned as the new value of <code>i</code>, hence <code>new_m + new_i =  old_m + old_i - T[old_i] + T[old_i] = old_m + old_i</code>. Now, the loop ends if <code>m + i</code> = ''n''; therefore, each branch of the loop can be reached at most ''n'' times, since they respectively increase either <code>m + i</code> or <code>m</code>, and <code>m \u2264 m + i</code>: if <code>m</code> = ''n'', then certainly <code>m + i</code> \u2265 ''n'', so that since it increases by unit increments at most, we must have had <code>m + i</code> = ''n'' at some point in the past, and therefore either way we would be done.\n\nThus the loop executes at most 2''n'' times, showing that the time complexity of the search algorithm is ''O''(''n'').\n\nHere is another way to think about the runtime:\nLet us say we begin to match <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> at position <code>i</code> and <code>p</code>. If <code>W</code> exists as a substring of <code>S</code> at p, then <code>W[0..m] = S[p..p+m]</code>.\nUpon success, that is, the word and the text matched at the positions (<code>W[i] = S[p+i]</code>), we increase <code>i</code> by 1.\nUpon failure, that is, the word and the text do not match at the positions (<code>W[i] \u2260 S[p+i]</code>), the text pointer is kept still, while the word pointer is rolled back a certain amount (<code>i = T[i]</code>, where <code>T</code> is the jump table), and we attempt to match <code>W[T[i]]</code> with <code>S[p+i]</code>.\nThe maximum number of roll-back of <code>i</code> is bounded by <code>i</code>, that is to say, for any failure, we can only roll back as much as we have progressed up to the failure.\nThen it is clear the runtime is 2''n''.\n\n==\"Partial match\" table (also known as \"failure function\")==\nThe goal of the table is to allow the algorithm not to match any character of <code>S</code> more than once.  The key observation about the nature of a linear search that allows this to happen is that in having checked some segment of the main string against an ''initial segment'' of the pattern, we know exactly at which places a new potential match which could continue to the current position could begin prior to the current position.  In other words, we \"pre-search\" the pattern itself and compile a list of all possible fallback positions that bypass a maximum of hopeless characters while not sacrificing any potential matches in doing so.\n\nWe want to be able to look up, for each position in <code>W</code>, the length of the longest possible initial segment of <code>W</code> leading up to (but not including) that position, other than the full segment starting at <code>W[0]</code> that just failed to match; this is how far we have to backtrack in finding the next match.  Hence <code>T[i]</code> is exactly the length of the longest possible ''proper'' initial segment of <code>W</code> which is also a segment of the substring ending at <code>W[i - 1]</code>.  We use the convention that the empty string has length 0.  Since a mismatch at the very start of the pattern is a special case (there is no possibility of backtracking), we set <code>T[0] = -1</code>, as discussed [[#Description of pseudocode for the table-building algorithm|below]].\n\n===Working example of the table-building algorithm===\nWe consider the example of <code>W = \"ABCDABD\"</code> first.  We will see that it follows much the same pattern as the main search, and is efficient for similar reasons.  We set <code>T[0] = -1</code>.  To find <code>T[1]</code>, we must discover a [[Substring#Suffix|proper suffix]] of <code>\"A\"</code> which is also a prefix of pattern <code>W</code>.  But there are no proper suffixes of <code>\"A\"</code>, so we set <code>T[1] = 0</code>. To find <code>T[2]</code>, we see that the substring <code>W[0]</code> - <code>W[1]</code> (<code>\"AB\"</code>) has a proper suffix <code>\"B\"</code>. However \"B\" is not a prefix of the pattern <code>W</code>. Therefore, we set <code>T[2] = 0</code>.\n\nContinuing to <code>T[3]</code>, we first check the proper suffix of length 1, and as in the previous case it fails. Should we also check longer suffixes? No, we now note that there is a shortcut to checking ''all'' suffixes: let us say that we discovered a [[Substring#Suffix|proper suffix]] which is a [[Substring#Prefix|proper prefix]] (A proper prefix of a string is not equal to the string itself) and ending at <code>W[2]</code> with length 2 (the maximum possible); then its first character is also a proper prefix of <code>W</code>, hence a proper prefix itself, and it ends at <code>W[1]</code>, which we already determined did not occur as <code>T[2] = 0</code> and not <code>T[2] = 1</code>. Hence at each stage, the shortcut rule is that one needs to consider checking suffixes of a given size m+1 only if a valid suffix of size m was found at the previous stage (i.e. <code>T[x] = m</code>) and should not bother to check m+2, m+3, etc.\n\nTherefore, we need not even concern ourselves with substrings having length 2, and as in the previous case the sole one with length 1 fails, so <code>T[3] = 0</code>.\n\nWe pass to the subsequent <code>W[4]</code>, <code>'A'</code>.  The same logic shows that the longest substring we need to consider has length 1, and as in the previous case it fails since \"D\" is not a prefix of <code>W</code>. But instead of setting <code>T[4] = 0</code>, we can do better by noting that <code>W[4] = W[0]</code>, and also that a look-up of <code>T[4]</code> implies the corresponding <code>S</code> character, <code>S[m+4]</code>, was a mismatch and therefore <code>S[m+4] \u2260 'A'</code>. Thus there is no point in restarting the search at <code>S[m+4]</code>; we should begin at 1 position ahead. This means that we may shift pattern <code>W</code> by match length plus one character, so <code>T[4] = -1</code>.\n\nConsidering now the next character, <code>W[5]</code>, which is <code>'B'</code>: though by inspection the longest substring would appear to be <code>'A'</code>, we still set <code>T[5] = 0</code>. The reasoning is similar to why <code>T[4] = -1</code>. <code>W[5]</code> itself extends the prefix match begun with <code>W[4]</code>, and we can assume that the corresponding character in <code>S</code>, <code>S[m+5] \u2260 'B'</code>. So backtracking before <code>W[5]</code> is pointless, but <code>S[m+5]</code> may be <code>'A'</code>, hence <code>T[5] = 0</code>.\n\nFinally, we see that the next character in the ongoing segment starting at <code>W[4] = 'A'</code> would be <code>'B'</code>, and indeed this is also <code>W[5]</code>.  Furthermore, the same argument as above shows that we need not look before <code>W[4]</code> to find a segment for <code>W[6]</code>, so that this is it, and we take <code>T[6] = 2</code>.\n\nTherefore, we compile the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| A\n| B\n| C\n| D\n| A\n| B\n| D\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| -1\n| 0\n| 2\n| 0\n|}\n\nAnother example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| C\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| B\n| C\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 1\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 3\n| 2\n| 0\n|}\n\nAnother example (slightly changed from the previous example):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| C\n| A\n| B\n| A\n| B\n| A\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 1\n| -1\n| 0\n| -1\n| 3\n| -1\n| 3\n|}\n\nAnother more complicated example:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-family:monospace; text-align:right\"\n!<code>i</code>\n| 00\n| 01\n| 02\n| 03\n| 04\n| 05\n| 06\n| 07\n| 08\n| 09\n| 10\n| 11\n| 12\n| 13\n| 14\n| 15\n| 16\n| 17\n| 18\n| 19\n| 20\n| 21\n| 22\n| 23\n| 24\n|-\n!<code>W[i]</code>\n| P\n| A\n| R\n| T\n| I\n| C\n| I\n| P\n| A\n| T\n| E\n|\n| I\n| N\n| \n| P\n| A\n| R\n| A\n| C\n| H\n| U\n| T\n| E\n|\n|-\n!<code>T[i]</code>\n| -1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| -1\n| 0\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| -1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 3\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|}\n\n===Description of pseudocode for the table-building algorithm===\n<!--Note to future editors: please do not replace or even supplement the pseudocode with language-specific code.

The KMP table has bigger shifts. See http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/node8.html-->\nThe example above illustrates the general technique for assembling the table with a minimum of fuss.  The principle is that of the overall search: most of the work was already done in getting to the current position, so very little needs to be done in leaving it.  The only minor complication is that the logic which is correct late in the string erroneously gives non-proper substrings at the beginning.  This necessitates some initialization code.\n \n '''algorithm''' ''kmp_table'':\n     '''input''':\n         an array of characters, W (the word to be analyzed)\n     '''output''':\n         an array of integers, T (the table to be filled)\n \n     '''define variables''':\n         an integer, pos \u2190 1 (the current position we are computing in T)\n         an integer, cnd \u2190 0 (the zero-based index in W of the next character of the current candidate substring)\n \n     '''let''' T[0] \u2190 -1\n \n     '''while''' pos < length(W) '''do'''\n         '''if''' W[pos] = W[cnd] '''then'''\n             '''let''' T[pos] \u2190 T[cnd]\n         '''else'''\n             '''let''' T[pos] \u2190 cnd\n             '''let''' cnd \u2190 T[cnd] (to increase performance)\n             '''while''' cnd \u2265 0 '''and''' W[pos] <> W[cnd] '''do'''\n                 '''let''' cnd \u2190 T[cnd]\n         '''let''' pos \u2190 pos + 1, cnd \u2190 cnd + 1\n \n     '''let''' T[pos] \u2190 cnd (only need when all word occurrences searched)\n\n===Efficiency of the table-building algorithm===\nThe complexity of the table algorithm is <code>O(k)</code>, where <code>k</code> is the length of <code>W</code>.  As except for some initialization all the work is done in the <code>'''while'''</code> loop, it is sufficient to show that this loop executes in <code>O(k)</code> time, which will be done by simultaneously examining the quantities <code>pos</code> and <code>pos - cnd</code>.  In the first branch, <code>pos - cnd</code> is preserved, as both <code>pos</code> and <code>cnd</code> are incremented simultaneously, but naturally, <code>pos</code> is increased.  In the second branch, <code>cnd</code> is replaced by <code>T[cnd]</code>, which we saw [[#Efficiency of the search algorithm|above]] is always strictly less than <code>cnd</code>, thus increasing <code>pos - cnd</code>. Since <code>pos &ge; pos - cnd</code>, this means that at each stage either <code>pos</code> or a lower bound for <code>pos</code> increases; therefore since the algorithm terminates once <code>pos = k</code>, it must terminate after at most <code>2k</code> iterations of the loop, since <code>pos - cnd</code> begins at <code>1</code>.  Therefore, the complexity of the table algorithm is <code>O(k)</code>.\n\n==Efficiency of the KMP algorithm==\nSince the two portions of the algorithm have, respectively, complexities of <code>O(k)</code> and <code>O(n)</code>, the complexity of the overall algorithm is <code>O(n + k)</code>.\n\nThese complexities are the same, no matter how many repetitive patterns are in <code>W</code> or <code>S</code>.\n\n==Variants==\nA [[Real-time computing|real-time]] version of KMP can be implemented using a separate failure function table for each character in the alphabet. If a mismatch occurs on character <math>x</math> in the text, the failure function table for character <math>x</math> is consulted for the index <math>i</math> in the pattern at which the mismatch took place. This will return the length of the longest substring ending at <math>i</math> matching a prefix of the pattern, with the added condition that the character after the prefix is <math>x</math>. With this restriction, character <math>x</math> in the text need not be checked again in the next phase, and so only a constant number of operations are executed between the processing of each index of the text{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. This satisfies the real-time computing restriction.\n\nThe [[Lexicographically_minimal_string_rotation#Booth's_Algorithm|Booth's algorithm]] uses a modified version of the KMP preprocessing function to find the [[lexicographically minimal string rotation]]. The failure function is progressively calculated as the string is rotated.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | first1=Thomas | last1=Cormen | author1-link=Thomas H.
