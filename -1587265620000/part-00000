After the hospital's original structure closed, [[Ohio|the state of Ohio]] acquired the property and renamed the complex and its surrounding grounds The Ridges. According to The Guide of Repository Holdings,<ref>{{cite book|last=McCabe|first=Doug|title=Athens Lunatic Asylum aka \"The Ridges\": A Guide to Repository Holdings|year=1993|publisher=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections|location=Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref> the term \"The Ridges\" was derived from a naming contest in 1984 to re-describe the area and its purpose.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Design and architectural features ===\nThe architect for the original building was [[Levi Scofield|Levi T. Scofield]] of Cleveland. The hospital grounds were designed by Herman Haerlin of [[Cincinnati]]. Some of Haerlin's other landscape designs are seen in Cincinnati's [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] and the Oval on the campus of [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Athens State Hospital|publisher=Division of Hygiene and Division of Hygiene and Mental Health|year=n.d.|location=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections - Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the buildings and grounds were influenced by Dr. [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]], a 19th-century physician who authored an influential treatise on hospital design called ''On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane''. [[Kirkbride Plan]] asylums are most recognizably characterized by the staggered \"bat-wing\" floor plan of their wards, [[High Victorian Gothic]] architecture, and their sprawling grounds. \n\nIn accordance with the Kirkbride Plan, the main building was to include a central administration building with a wing for men on one side and a wing for women on the other, each with their own separate dining halls. There was room to house 572 patients in the main building, almost double Kirkbride's recommendation. The main building itself was 853 feet long and 60 feet in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=2018-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929175628/http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|archive-date=2017-09-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\n=== Construction ===\nThe land where the hospital was built originally belonged to the Arthur Coates and Eliakim H. Moore farms. Ground was broken on November 5, 1868. The first iteration of the asylum consisted of only {{convert|141|acre}} and over the years, grew to occupy over {{convert|1000|acre}} of land and 78 buildings.\n\n=== Operating years (1874-1993) ===\n\nAthens Lunatic Asylum began operation on January 9, 1874. Within two years of its opening, the hospital was renamed The Athens Hospital for the Insane. Later, the hospital would be called the Athens Asylum for the Insane, the Athens State Hospital, the Southeastern Ohio Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center, the Athens Mental Health and Developmental Center, and then (again) the Athens Mental Health Center. <gallery>\nImage:Ridges dayshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first day shift staff. Taken in 1873.\nImage:Ridges nightshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first night shift staff. Taken in 1873.\n</gallery>The original hospital was in operation from 1874 to 1993. Although not a wholly self-sustaining facility, many Kirkbride Plan asylums functioned as cloistered communities, and for decades the hospital had livestock, farm fields and gardens, an orchard, greenhouses, a dairy, a physical plant to generate steam heat, and even a carriage shop. A large percentage of the work it took to maintain the facility was originally carried out by patients. Labor, especially skilled labor, was seen by the Kirkbride Plan as a form of therapy and was economically advantageous for the state.\n\nThe asylum expanded to include specialized and ancillary buildings such as the [[Athens State Hospital Cow Barn|Dairy Barn]] (now an arts center), Beacon School, Athens Receiving Hospital, Center Hospital and the Tubercular Ward (\"Cottage B\"). Also built onto the main building were a laundry room and a boiler house. Seven cottages, including Cottage B, were constructed to house even more patients. While they had a smaller capacity than the main wards, they allowed for constructive grouping of patients in dormitory-like rooms. \n\nBy the 1950s the hospital was the town's largest employer, with 1,800 patients on a 1,019-acre, 78-building campus. At its peak the Athens Lunatic Asylum served Adams, Athens, Gallia, Highland, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Morgan, Perry, Pike, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Washington counties. \n\n=== Decline and closure ===\nThe [[Mental healthcare in the United States|mental healthcare industry in the United States]] underwent a sea change in the 1950s. Research began to show that the mentally ill did not pose an inherent danger to their communities. The public became increasingly aware of procedures like [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] and the [[lobotomy]], which would come to be seen as cruel, unnecessary and inhumane. The availability of psychoactive drugs for the treatment of mental illnesses, as well as the increasing prevalence of psychological therapy, allowed for most patients to be treated without the need for internment in a prison-like institution. The asylum, among many others, declined throughout the latter half of the 20th century and eventually closed in 1993. However, the state hospital continued to function in Athens, with some patients and staff relocating to a newly constructed facility which, at the time of the transition in 1993, was called the Southeast Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric hospital in Athens - visible from the asylum - is now named Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare.\n\n== Modern history and present day ==\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBy the early 1990s, many of the original buildings had fallen into disrepair, following a similar pattern of decline and neglect among Kirkbride Plan asylums. As the mental healthcare industry transitioned away from large, centralized institutions, the will to support sprawling hospital complexes diminished. Large asylums were slowly phased out, with most operations shifting to small outpatient centers scattered throughout the community. Because the asylums were typically located on a hill outside of the nearest municipal center, their degradation was able to occur out of sight and out of mind. Under private ownership, abandoned Kirkbrides often languished unmaintained and unsecured, slowly being reclaimed by nature, as with [[Hudson River State Hospital]] in New York. Since abandoned structures represent a serious insurance liability, there is incentive for the property owner to secure them, and abandoned property owned by colleges and universities may be especially easy targets for urban exploration, squatting, or vandalism by members of the student body or the general public.\n\nIn 1993 the Athens Lunatic Asylum's property was deeded over to [[Ohio University]] in a land swap with the state's Department of Mental Health. Under the ownership of Ohio University, the property was kept in relatively good shape and was maintained for reuse.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nWith [[urban exploration]] and [[modern ruins]] occupying a growing niche of public consciousness through entertainment and media, Kirkbride Plan asylums have enjoyed renewed public attention in the 2000s and 2010s. Two historically significant Kirkbrides, [[Danvers State Hospital]] in Massachusetts and the aforementioned Hudson River State Hospital in New York, fell into dangerous disrepair in the 1990s and 2000s and eventually underwent partial demolition to make way for new development. \n\nAt Athens, the ownership of a stable funding authority (Ohio University) has ensured restoration of much of the original grounds, as envisioned by the original planners, in a mixed-use university development called The Ridges.\n\nMost buildings have been renovated and turned into classrooms and office buildings. The administration building is now the home of The Kennedy Art Museum [http://www.ohio.edu/museum/], showcasing paintings and artwork of all different types of artists. The Dairy Barn Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization, is located in the old hospital's remodeled dairy barn; it is privately owned and operated. The Dairy Barn [http://www.dairybarn.org] operates a calendar for sculpting and exhibits. The [[George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs]] is also located at The Ridges, in a set of three separate buildings across the area.\n\nThe old tubercular ward, \"Cottage B\", which sat on a hill separated from the other buildings, was demolished by Ohio University in 2013 due to the large number of college students exploring the dangerous structure. Cottage B was designed to early 1900s fireproofing standards and incorporated copious asbestos lining inside the walls, making it difficult to remediate.\n\nMembers of the Athens, Ohio chapter of NAMI, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], have worked to restore the three graveyards located on the grounds of The Ridges. School organizations provide tours of the facility around Halloween time each year. The preserve is also regularly used by the school's [[US Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] [[battalion]].\n\n== Treatment and quality of care ==\nThe first patient of the Asylum was a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy, thought to be possessed by a demon. Epilepsy was considered a major cause of \"insanity\" and reason for admission to the hospital in the early years. The first annual report lists thirty-one men and nineteen women as having their insanity caused by epilepsy. General \"ill health\" accounted for the admission of thirty-nine men and forty-four women in the first three years of the hospital's operation. \n\nAilments such as menopause, alcohol addiction, and tuberculosis were cause for enrollment in the hospital. For the [[Lunatic asylum#Women in psychiatric institutions|female patients]] hospitalized during these first three years of the asylum's operation, the three leading causes of insanity are recorded as \"puerperal condition\" (51 women), \"change of life\" (32 women), and \"menstrual derangements\" (29 women). Women with postpartum depression or \"hysteria\" were labeled insane and sent to recover in the institution. Women were often institutionalized for unnecessary or outright fallacious reasons. \n\nThe second-most common cause of insanity, as recorded in the first annual report, was \"intemperance and dissipation\". In the hospital's first three years of operation, according to the annual report of 1876, eighty-one men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by masturbation. Fifty-six men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by \"intemperance and dissipation\" during this same period of time.\n\nRecords from the asylum document some of the now-discredited theories of the causes of mental illness, as well as the practice of harmful treatments, such as lobotomy. The Ohio University archives collection information regarding employees' background training, which ranged from full training and qualification to a complete lack thereof. Most disturbing is the documentation of hydrotherapy, electroshock, lobotomy, and early psychotropic drugs, many of which have been discredited today as extremely inhumane ways of treating a patient.\n\n==Cemeteries==\nMyths and mystery surround a well-known site in southern Ohio, The Athens Lunatic Asylum. The mystery is fueled, perhaps, because the public cannot access a majority of the information about patients who were treated and lived at the asylum. With special permission and filling out paperwork that is required by the state of Ohio, some of the information can be accessed, however, those interested in finding out about the patients that walked through the doors of the Asylum can satisfy their curiosity by looking to the cemeteries. \n \n\"There are 1,930 people buried at the three cemeteries located at the Ridges. Of those, 700 women and 959 men lay under the headstones marked only with a number.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite news|title=Friends of the Athens Asylum Cemeteries|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection Mahon Center Athens Ohio}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref>\nThere were some patients who had died that were reunited with their families and buried in cemeteries around their homes. By 1943, the State of Ohio began putting names, births, and deaths, on the markers of the patients who died. (Friends of Asylum, McCabe)It is unknown as to why the state switched from using only numbers to using names in order to verify who the deceased were, but this practice remained constant through the remainder of time that patients were buried up at the asylum. Although the newer stones had names, births, and deaths, the older stones that remained had not been replaced until recently.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s the state no longer took care of the cemeteries which made it easy for outsiders to vandalize them. Natural occurrences also caused damage.\nThe stones marking where patients were buried were in desperate need of repair. They were left to the elements and \"hundreds of stones were left uprooted and broken.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|title=NAMI-Athens:Projects|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107100757/http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> \nBeginning in 2000, the Athens, Ohio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) started the reclamation for the cemeteries, taking on the work that was once the responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> NAMI, Athens worked to help restore the cemeteries at the Asylum to its original state. The organization got \"involved with other groups and organizations in a major effort to restore, beautify and demystify the three mental health grave yards located on the grounds of the old psychiatric hospital complex on The Ridges.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> \"Since nearly the time of the opening of the cemeteries the State of Ohio has allowed families to erect private markers at the graves of their loved ones, There are very few graves marked in such a way, most likely because descendants are unaware of the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nSince the take over, more information has been found out about the patients that are buried in the three cemeteries. A large portion of the information that has been recovered is about the veterans that had spent the remaining days of their lives at the Asylum. Many of these veterans did not receive honors and only 19 have had any recognition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Veterans Day 2010 At The Ridges|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection, Mahon Center, Ohio University}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref> There are 80 veterans that are buried at the Ridges. Of these veterans two fought in the Mexican War, sixty-eight fought in the Civil War, one was a member in the Confederate Army and another two veterans served with the United States Colored infantry. There are three veterans who served in the Spanish\u2013American War, and seven fought in World War I. Some of the other veterans that are buried here were active duty in the late 19th century and the early 20th century.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nNAMI has also done other things to honor those who have served our country as well as the other patients who are buried in the cemeteries at the Ridges. Besides helping replace grave stones and keeping the grounds in proper condition, in 2005, the Ridges Cemeteries Committee has been organizing Memorial Day Ceremonies for the many veterans buried at the asylum. \"Prior to 2005, the veterans had never received such honors. Indeed, neither they nor the others in those cemeteries had received more than a very austere burial - no personalized service whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|title=NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415095840/http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> NAMI started the Memorial Day Ceremonies to help restore dignity to the patients on the Ridges and to help recognize the sacrifice of the veterans, many who had probably suffered through post traumatic stress disorder as well as other post war symptoms.<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\"/>\n\n\"To find these \"lost\" veterans, they were found \"through a special search within a broader research project to find background information on the over 1,900 patients buried in the Asylum's three cemeteries. With the Help of the Athens County Veterans Service Office and a special appropriation from the Athens county Commissioners flag stands and flags have been placed at the graves of all the veterans in the three cemeteries.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== In culture ==\nKirkbride Plan asylums occupy a unique niche in the culture. As more than 70 were built across the nation (with 25 surviving as of 2019) they are a uniquely accessible and idyllic representation of the allures of urban exploration. Kirkbride Plan asylums have appeared in films and television, been the subjects of notable photographers, and inspired fictional locations such as [[Arkham Asylum]] in [[Batman]] and Parsons State Insane Asylum in [[Fallout 4]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* Annual Report of the Trustees of Athens Lunatic Asylum to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1872.

However, the state hospital continued to function in Athens, with some patients and staff relocating to a newly constructed facility which, at the time of the transition in 1993, was called the Southeast Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric hospital in Athens - visible from the asylum - is now named Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare.\n\n== Modern history and present day ==\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBy the early 1990s, many of the original buildings had fallen into disrepair, following a similar pattern of decline and neglect among Kirkbride Plan asylums. As the mental healthcare industry transitioned away from large, centralized institutions, the will to support sprawling hospital complexes diminished. Large asylums were slowly phased out, with most operations shifting to small outpatient centers scattered throughout the community. Because the asylums were typically located on a hill outside of the nearest municipal center, their degradation was able to occur out of sight and out of mind. Under private ownership, abandoned Kirkbrides often languished unmaintained and unsecured, slowly being reclaimed by nature, as with [[Hudson River State Hospital]] in New York. Since abandoned structures represent a serious insurance liability, there is incentive for the property owner to secure them, and abandoned property owned by colleges and universities may be especially easy targets for urban exploration, squatting, or vandalism by members of the student body or the general public.\n\nIn 1993 the Athens Lunatic Asylum's property was deeded over to [[Ohio University]] in a land swap with the state's Department of Mental Health. Under the ownership of Ohio University, the property was kept in relatively good shape and was maintained for reuse.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nWith [[urban exploration]] and [[modern ruins]] occupying a growing niche of public consciousness through entertainment and media, Kirkbride Plan asylums have enjoyed renewed public attention in the 2000s and 2010s. Two historically significant Kirkbrides, [[Danvers State Hospital]] in Massachusetts and the aforementioned Hudson River State Hospital in New York, fell into dangerous disrepair in the 1990s and 2000s and eventually underwent partial demolition to make way for new development. \n\nAt Athens, the ownership of a stable funding authority (Ohio University) has ensured restoration of much of the original grounds, as envisioned by the original planners, in a mixed-use university development called The Ridges.\n\nMost buildings have been renovated and turned into classrooms and office buildings. The administration building is now the home of The Kennedy Art Museum [http://www.ohio.edu/museum/], showcasing paintings and artwork of all different types of artists. The Dairy Barn Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization, is located in the old hospital's remodeled dairy barn; it is privately owned and operated. The Dairy Barn [http://www.dairybarn.org] operates a calendar for sculpting and exhibits. The [[George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs]] is also located at The Ridges, in a set of three separate buildings across the area.\n\nThe old tubercular ward, \"Cottage B\", which sat on a hill separated from the other buildings, was demolished by Ohio University in 2013 due to the large number of college students exploring the dangerous structure. Cottage B was designed to early 1900s fireproofing standards and incorporated copious asbestos lining inside the walls, making it difficult to remediate.\n\nMembers of the Athens, Ohio chapter of NAMI, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], have worked to restore the three graveyards located on the grounds of The Ridges. School organizations provide tours of the facility around Halloween time each year. The preserve is also regularly used by the school's [[US Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] [[battalion]].\n\n== Treatment and quality of care ==\nThe first patient of the Asylum was a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy, thought to be possessed by a demon. Epilepsy was considered a major cause of \"insanity\" and reason for admission to the hospital in the early years. The first annual report lists thirty-one men and nineteen women as having their insanity caused by epilepsy. General \"ill health\" accounted for the admission of thirty-nine men and forty-four women in the first three years of the hospital's operation. \n\nAilments such as menopause, alcohol addiction, and tuberculosis were cause for enrollment in the hospital. For the [[Lunatic asylum#Women in psychiatric institutions|female patients]] hospitalized during these first three years of the asylum's operation, the three leading causes of insanity are recorded as \"puerperal condition\" (51 women), \"change of life\" (32 women), and \"menstrual derangements\" (29 women). Women with postpartum depression or \"hysteria\" were labeled insane and sent to recover in the institution. Women were often institutionalized for unnecessary or outright fallacious reasons. \n\nThe second-most common cause of insanity, as recorded in the first annual report, was \"intemperance and dissipation\". In the hospital's first three years of operation, according to the annual report of 1876, eighty-one men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by masturbation. Fifty-six men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by \"intemperance and dissipation\" during this same period of time.\n\nRecords from the asylum document some of the now-discredited theories of the causes of mental illness, as well as the practice of harmful treatments, such as lobotomy. The Ohio University archives collection information regarding employees' background training, which ranged from full training and qualification to a complete lack thereof. Most disturbing is the documentation of hydrotherapy, electroshock, lobotomy, and early psychotropic drugs, many of which have been discredited today as extremely inhumane ways of treating a patient.\n\n==Cemeteries==\nMyths and mystery surround a well-known site in southern Ohio, The Athens Lunatic Asylum. The mystery is fueled, perhaps, because the public cannot access a majority of the information about patients who were treated and lived at the asylum. With special permission and filling out paperwork that is required by the state of Ohio, some of the information can be accessed, however, those interested in finding out about the patients that walked through the doors of the Asylum can satisfy their curiosity by looking to the cemeteries. \n \n\"There are 1,930 people buried at the three cemeteries located at the Ridges. Of those, 700 women and 959 men lay under the headstones marked only with a number.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite news|title=Friends of the Athens Asylum Cemeteries|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection Mahon Center Athens Ohio}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref>\nThere were some patients who had died that were reunited with their families and buried in cemeteries around their homes. By 1943, the State of Ohio began putting names, births, and deaths, on the markers of the patients who died. (Friends of Asylum, McCabe)It is unknown as to why the state switched from using only numbers to using names in order to verify who the deceased were, but this practice remained constant through the remainder of time that patients were buried up at the asylum. Although the newer stones had names, births, and deaths, the older stones that remained had not been replaced until recently.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s the state no longer took care of the cemeteries which made it easy for outsiders to vandalize them. Natural occurrences also caused damage.\nThe stones marking where patients were buried were in desperate need of repair. They were left to the elements and \"hundreds of stones were left uprooted and broken.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|title=NAMI-Athens:Projects|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107100757/http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> \nBeginning in 2000, the Athens, Ohio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) started the reclamation for the cemeteries, taking on the work that was once the responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> NAMI, Athens worked to help restore the cemeteries at the Asylum to its original state. The organization got \"involved with other groups and organizations in a major effort to restore, beautify and demystify the three mental health grave yards located on the grounds of the old psychiatric hospital complex on The Ridges.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> \"Since nearly the time of the opening of the cemeteries the State of Ohio has allowed families to erect private markers at the graves of their loved ones, There are very few graves marked in such a way, most likely because descendants are unaware of the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nSince the take over, more information has been found out about the patients that are buried in the three cemeteries. A large portion of the information that has been recovered is about the veterans that had spent the remaining days of their lives at the Asylum. Many of these veterans did not receive honors and only 19 have had any recognition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Veterans Day 2010 At The Ridges|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection, Mahon Center, Ohio University}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref> There are 80 veterans that are buried at the Ridges. Of these veterans two fought in the Mexican War, sixty-eight fought in the Civil War, one was a member in the Confederate Army and another two veterans served with the United States Colored infantry. There are three veterans who served in the Spanish\u2013American War, and seven fought in World War I. Some of the other veterans that are buried here were active duty in the late 19th century and the early 20th century.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nNAMI has also done other things to honor those who have served our country as well as the other patients who are buried in the cemeteries at the Ridges. Besides helping replace grave stones and keeping the grounds in proper condition, in 2005, the Ridges Cemeteries Committee has been organizing Memorial Day Ceremonies for the many veterans buried at the asylum. \"Prior to 2005, the veterans had never received such honors. Indeed, neither they nor the others in those cemeteries had received more than a very austere burial - no personalized service whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|title=NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415095840/http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> NAMI started the Memorial Day Ceremonies to help restore dignity to the patients on the Ridges and to help recognize the sacrifice of the veterans, many who had probably suffered through post traumatic stress disorder as well as other post war symptoms.<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\"/>\n\n\"To find these \"lost\" veterans, they were found \"through a special search within a broader research project to find background information on the over 1,900 patients buried in the Asylum's three cemeteries. With the Help of the Athens County Veterans Service Office and a special appropriation from the Athens county Commissioners flag stands and flags have been placed at the graves of all the veterans in the three cemeteries.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== In culture ==\nKirkbride Plan asylums occupy a unique niche in the culture. As more than 70 were built across the nation (with 25 surviving as of 2019) they are a uniquely accessible and idyllic representation of the allures of urban exploration. Kirkbride Plan asylums have appeared in films and television, been the subjects of notable photographers, and inspired fictional locations such as [[Arkham Asylum]] in [[Batman]] and Parsons State Insane Asylum in [[Fallout 4]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* Annual Report of the Trustees of Athens Lunatic Asylum to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1872.

He is most known for founding the African American Patrolman's League. During his career as a police officer,  Robinson was responsible for bringing  a [[civil rights]] lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department for discrimination against minorities ([[African-Americans]] and [[Latinos]]).\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Chicago]], to Mabel and Robert Robinson, he graduated from [[Hyde Park Academy High School|Hyde Park High School]] (now Hyde Park Academy High School) in 1960. \n\n===Chicago Police Department===\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://soundcloud.com/radio-diaries/police-officer-renault-robinson?in=radio-diaries/sets/the-working-tapes Renault Robinson talks with Studs Terkel on WFMT; 1971], 5:42, [[Radio Diaries]]<ref name=\"studs\">{{cite web|title=The Working Tapes|url=http://www.radiodiaries.org/the-working-tapes/|website=[[Radio Diaries]]|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nRobinson joined the [[Chicago Police Department]] in 1964, and was involved in [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/media/88315631-132.html# providing police protection] for the September 4, 1966, march on Cicero, Illinois.  In 1968 Robinson co-founded the Chicago Police Department's [[Afro-American Patrolmen\u2019s League]] (Later known as the Afro American Police League and now known as the African American Police League), an organization aimed at improving police service to the black community and at getting more blacks into policymaking positions in the department.<ref name=historymakers/><ref name=time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943306-1,00.html TIME Magazine: The Anguish of Blacks in Blue]</ref>  The formation of the AAPL led to an increase in minority officers and civil rights lawsuits against the CPD for the discrimination of [[African American]] and Hispanic citizens.

The oldest Scandinavian source mentioning the existence of the Papar, however, the ''[[\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k]]'' (\"Book of the Icelanders\") by Icelandic chronicler [[Ari \u00deorgilsson]], was written between 1122 and 1133, some time after the event. \u00deorgilsson writes of \"Christian men\", titled the 'Papar' by the Norsemen, who departed the isle because of their dislike of the 'heathen' Norse, pointing to the possibility of the Papar having arrived before the Norse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sagamuseum.is/overview/|title=Sagamuseum - Overview |last=|first=|date=|website=www.sagamuseum.is|publisher=|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref>\n\nAn earlier source that could possibly refer to the Papar is the work of [[Dicuil]], an early 9th-century Irish monk and geographer, which included mention of the wandering of \"holy men\" to the lands of the north. However, it is not known whether Dicuil is speaking about Iceland, as [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-Irish hermits also settled in other islands of the north such as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].\n\nSeveral Icelandic [[toponymy|toponyms]] have been linked to the Papar, including the island of [[Papey]] and the [[Vestmannaeyjar]] (\"islands of the [[Vestmenn|Westmen]]\"), but no archaeological evidence in these places has yet confirmed the link.\n\nAnother theory is that the two sources were conflated and that \u00deorgilsson based his history on the writings of Dicuil.\n\nThe ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'' (The Icelandic Book of Settlements), possibly dating from the 11th century in its original form, clearly states on page one that Irish monks had been living on Iceland before the arrival of Norse settlers. According to this account, the basis behind this knowledge was monks' leaving behind numerous reminders of their stay, including Irish books, bells and [[crosier]]s, helping the Norse to identify their predecessors. According to the Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k, the Irish monks left the island either when the Norse arrived or were no longer living there when the Norse arrived.\n\n== Papar in the Faroes ==\nThere are also several toponyms relating to the Papar in the [[Faroe Islands]]. Among these are Papar\u00f8kur near [[Vestmanna]], and Papursh\u00edlsur near [[Saksun]]. Vestmanna, in fact, is short for ''Vestmannah\u00f8vn'', meaning the \"harbour of the [[Vestmenn|Westmen]]\" ([[Gaels]]). A churchyard on the island of [[Sk\u00favoy|Sk\u00fagvoy]] also has tombstones which display a possible Gaelic origin or influence.<ref name=ref1>Schei, Liv Kj\u00f8rsvik & Moberg, Gunnie (2003) ''The Faroe Islands''.

(1990). ''Play''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref> Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably [[mammals]].\n\nMany prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including [[Melanie Klein]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]] have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories.\n\nPlay is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a [[game]]. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive.<ref name=Huizinga>{{cite book|last1=Huizinga|first1=J|title=Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture|date=1980|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-0578-6|edition=3rd|url=http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1474/homo_ludens_johan_huizinga_routledge_1949_.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as [[hand-eye coordination]]), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe seminal text in the field of play studies is the book ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which [[Johan Huizinga]] defines play as follows:<ref name=Huizinga/>{{rp|13}}\n{{quote|\"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means.\"}}\n\nThis definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the \"magic circle\" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga.<ref name=Huizinga/> Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, \"the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|title=Play, dreams and imitation|date=1962|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=147|volume= 24}}</ref>\n\nThere are multiple aspects of play people home in on when defining it. One definition from Susanna Millar's ''The Psychology of Play'' defines play as: \u201cany purposeful mental or physical activity performed either individually or group-wise in leisure time or at work for enjoyment, relaxation, and satisfaction of real-time or long term needs.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  This definition particularly emphasizes the conditions and benefits to be gained under certain actions or activities related to play. Other definitions may focus on play as an activity that must follow certain characteristics including willingness to engage, uncertainty of the outcome, and productivity of the activity to society.\n\nAnother definition of play from the twenty-first century comes from the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA). The definition reads as follows: \u201cplay is freely chosen, personally directed, intrinsically motivated behaviour that actively engages the child.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playengland.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/best-play.pdf|website=www.playengland.net|title=Best Play: What Play Provision Should Do For Children|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> This definition focuses more on the child's freedom of choice and personal motivation related to an activity.\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:July 4th Traditions (7188250241).jpg|thumbnail|People having fun]]\nPlay can take the form of improvisation or pretense, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher [[Roger Caillois]] wrote about play in his 1961 book ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'' and [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''.<ref>Nachmanovitch, Stephen, ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''. Tarcher/Penguin 1990.</ref> Nachmanovitch writes that:\n\n{{quote| Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42) }}\n\nFree play gives children the freedom to decide what they want to play and how it will be played. Both the activity and the rules are subject to change in this form, and children can make any changes to the rules or objectives of the play at any time.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Early Years Education|volume=26|issue=4|pages=335\u2013339|doi=10.1080/09669760.2018.1527278|title=The play's the thing|year=2018|last1=Murray|first1=Jane|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some countries in the twenty-first century have added emphasis of free play into their values for children in early childhood such as Taiwan and Hungary.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nStructured play has clearly defined [[objective (goal)|goals]] and rules and such play is called a \"[[game]]\".

While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.<ref name=Huizinga/>\n\nOther designed play spaces can be [[playgrounds]] with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at [[Children's Museums]], [[Science museums|Science Centers]], or [[Family entertainment center|Family Entertainment Centers]]. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically [[Business|For-Profit]] businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically [[Non-Profit]] organizations for educational entertainment.\n\nThe California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:<ref name=\"nifplay\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nifplay.org/science/pattern-play/ |title=The Science \u2013 Patterns of Play|author=National Institute for Play |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>\n# '''Attunement play''', which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.\n# '''Body play''', in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.\n# '''Object play''', such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.\n# '''Social play''', play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.\n# '''Imaginative or pretend play''', in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.\n# '''Storytelling play''', the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.\n# '''Creative play''', by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.\n\nSeparate from self-initiated play, [[play therapy]] is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56767-652-5}}</ref>\n\n==Children==\n{{see|Children's games|Children's street culture|Make believe|Street games}}In young children, play is frequently associated with [[cognitive development]] and [[socialization]].

In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at [[summer camp]]s and through supervised playgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1|title=What Park Did You Hang Out At?|first=Stephanie|last=Warner}}</ref> Under the [[New Deal]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]], thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child's individual freedom was being played out in [[cyberspace]].<ref>Chudacoff, Howard, ''Children at Play: An American History'' (2008).

When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the \"attention-getting skill\" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.\n\nObserving play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in [[Tonkean macaque]]s, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting). [[File:Jack Russell Terrier Eddi at the beach.JPG|right|thumb|A [[dog]] plays with a [[ball]].]]\n\nOne theory \u2013 \"play as preparation\" \u2013 was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. [[Predator]]s such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as [[deer]] and [[zebra]]s play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s.<ref name=\"Bergh\u00e4nel\" /> While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nJohn Byers, a zoologist at the [[University of Idaho]], discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the [[cerebellum]], suggesting that play is not so much about practicing ''exact'' behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain&nbsp;\u2013 part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.<ref name=NYT/>{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = top\n| header = Humans and non-human animals playing in water\n| width1 = 306\n| image1 = Porto Covo July 2011-1.jpg\n| caption1 = Playing in the surf is among the favorite activities of children at the beach\n| width2 = 142\n| image2 = Dolphinsurfresize.jpg\n| caption2 = Dolphins playing in the surf\n}}\n\nMarc Bekoff (a [[University of Colorado]] evolutionary biologist) proposes a \"flexibility\" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of [[equifinality]]. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid \"false endpoints\". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works \"well enough\", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.<ref name=NYT/> A study on two species of monkeys ''Semnopithecus entellus'' and ''Macaca mulatta'' that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.<ref>B.

Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with [[G. Stanley Hall]], the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ginsburg|first1=K.R.|year=2007|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds|journal=Pediatrics|volume=119|issue=1|pages=182\u2013191|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2697|pmid=17200287|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Genius of Play: Celebrating the Spirit of Childhood|author=Jenkinson, Sally|publisher=Hawthorn Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-903458-04-4|location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\nModern research in the field of [[affective neuroscience]] (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.<ref>Panksepp, ''Affective Neuroscience 98''</ref> For example, researcher [[Roger Caillois]] used the word ''[[ilinx]]'' to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.\n\nStudies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.<ref>Goldstein & Russ, 2000\u20132001</ref><ref>Campos, Frankel, & Camras, 2004</ref> By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.\n\n=== Physical, mental and social ===\nVarious forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals. As little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play), can improve cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"cognitive:1\" >{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/2207676.2208323 | chapter=The acute cognitive benefits of casual exergame play | year=2012 | title=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  | page=1863 | last1 = Gao | first1 = Yue | last2 = Mandryk | first2 = Regan| isbn=978-1-4503-1015-4 | citeseerx=10.1.1.248.3183 }}</ref> These researchers did a study and have developed an \"exergame\" which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise.

The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study.<ref name=\"cognitive:1\" />\n\nOn the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014),\n\"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities \u2013 when playing [[video game]] occurs in moderation\".<ref>[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620743598 Hollis, S. D. (2014). Cognitive effects and academic consequences of video game playing (Order No. 1566326).]</ref>\n\nPlay can also influence one's social development and social interactions. Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that \"integral to positive development is the child's social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.<ref>Sinclair, J. et al. (1995). Exergame development using the dual flow model. Proc. IE 2009, 1-7.</ref>\n\nSocial benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers.<ref name=\"social:4\">Sullivan, C. (2003).

ProQuest, UMI Dissertations.</ref> One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play<ref name=\"social:4\" /> Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.\n\n=== Play in educational practices ===\n\n==== Anji play ====\nAnji play \u5b89\u5409\u6e38\u620f in simplified Chinese \u5b89\u5409\u904a\u6232 in traditional Chinese is an educational method based on children's self-directed play in outside spaces, using simple tools made of natural material. The teachers and instructors only observe and document the children's independent play. The method was created by Cheng Xueqin and is organized in two hours of free play when the children choose the available material they want to use and build structures to play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2016/08/10/child-s-play-preparations-for-future-success|title=Child's play preparations for future success|last=Euronews|date=2016-08-10|website=www.euronews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nWhile planning, experimenting, building and using the structures to play, the children have the opportunity to interact with peers, to think critically about what may work, to discuss the plan and organize the construction hard work. The process is observed and recorded by the teachers and instructors without intervention, even in instances of possible risk.\n\nBefore and after the two hours of play, the children have the opportunity to express their plans and discuss with their peers. After the play, they get the opportunity to draw, write or explain what they did. Then, they watch the videos recorded the same day and explain how they played and comment on each other's creations.\n\nAnji play is also called \u201ctrue play\u201d and its guiding principles are love, risk, joy, engagement, and reflection. This method of self-initiated and self-directed play is applied at the pre-schools (to children from 3 to 6 years-old) in Anji county, East China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AnjiPlay/how-did-anji-play-go-global-18e1e4bca996|title=How Did \"Anji Play\" Go Global?|last=Coffino|first=Jesse|date=2017-03-20|website=jesse coffino|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Caillois, R.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref> Play is commonly associated with children and juvenile-level activities, but play occurs at any life stage, and among other higher-functioning animals as well, most notably [[mammals]].\n\nMany prominent researchers in the field of psychology, including [[Melanie Klein]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]] have viewed play as confined to the human species, believing play was important for human development and using different research methods to prove their theories.\n\nPlay is often interpreted as frivolous; yet the player can be intently focused on their objective, particularly when play is structured and goal-oriented, as in a [[game]]. Accordingly, play can range from relaxed, free-spirited and spontaneous through frivolous to planned or even compulsive.<ref name=Huizinga>{{cite book|last1=Huizinga|first1=J|title=Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture|date=1980|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-0578-6|edition=3rd|url=http://art.yale.edu/file_columns/0000/1474/homo_ludens_johan_huizinga_routledge_1949_.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Play is not just a pastime activity; it has the potential to serve as an important tool in numerous aspects of daily life for adolescents, adults, and cognitively advanced non-human species (such as primates). Not only does play promote and aid in physical development (such as [[hand-eye coordination]]), but it also aids in cognitive development and social skills, and can even act as a stepping stone into the world of integration, which can be a very stressful process. Play is something that most children partake in, but the way play is executed is different between cultures and the way that children engage with play varies universally.\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe seminal text in the field of play studies is the book ''[[Homo Ludens]]'' first published in 1944 with several subsequent editions, in which [[Johan Huizinga]] defines play as follows:<ref name=Huizinga/>{{rp|13}}\n{{quote|\"Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means.\"}}\n\nThis definition of play as constituting a separate and independent sphere of human activity is sometimes referred to as the \"magic circle\" notion of play, a phrase also attributed to Huizinga.<ref name=Huizinga/> Many other definitions exist. Jean Piaget stated, \"the many theories of play expounded in the past are clear proof that the phenomenon is difficult to understand.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Piaget|first1=Jean|title=Play, dreams and imitation|date=1962|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=147|volume= 24}}</ref>\n\nThere are multiple aspects of play people home in on when defining it. One definition from Susanna Millar's ''The Psychology of Play'' defines play as: \u201cany purposeful mental or physical activity performed either individually or group-wise in leisure time or at work for enjoyment, relaxation, and satisfaction of real-time or long term needs.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  This definition particularly emphasizes the conditions and benefits to be gained under certain actions or activities related to play. Other definitions may focus on play as an activity that must follow certain characteristics including willingness to engage, uncertainty of the outcome, and productivity of the activity to society.\n\nAnother definition of play from the twenty-first century comes from the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA). The definition reads as follows: \u201cplay is freely chosen, personally directed, intrinsically motivated behaviour that actively engages the child.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playengland.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/best-play.pdf|website=www.playengland.net|title=Best Play: What Play Provision Should Do For Children|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> This definition focuses more on the child's freedom of choice and personal motivation related to an activity.\n\n==Forms==\n[[File:July 4th Traditions (7188250241).jpg|thumbnail|People having fun]]\nPlay can take the form of improvisation or pretense, interactive, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and thrill-seeking, such as extreme or dangerous sports (sky-diving, high-speed racing, etc.). Philosopher [[Roger Caillois]] wrote about play in his 1961 book ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'' and [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] expanded on these concepts in his 1990 book ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''.<ref>Nachmanovitch, Stephen, ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''. Tarcher/Penguin 1990.</ref> Nachmanovitch writes that:\n\n{{quote| Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42) }}\n\nFree play gives children the freedom to decide what they want to play and how it will be played. Both the activity and the rules are subject to change in this form, and children can make any changes to the rules or objectives of the play at any time.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Early Years Education|volume=26|issue=4|pages=335\u2013339|doi=10.1080/09669760.2018.1527278|title=The play's the thing|year=2018|last1=Murray|first1=Jane|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some countries in the twenty-first century have added emphasis of free play into their values for children in early childhood such as Taiwan and Hungary.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nStructured play has clearly defined [[objective (goal)|goals]] and rules and such play is called a \"[[game]]\". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of [[happiness]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[Sports]] with defined rules will take place within designated play spaces, such as sports fields where, in [[Soccer]] for example, players kick a ball in a certain direction and push opponents out of their way as they do so. While appropriate within the sport's play space, these same behaviors might be inappropriate or even illegal outside the playing field.<ref name=Huizinga/>\n\nOther designed play spaces can be [[playgrounds]] with dedicated equipment and structures to promote active and social play. Some play spaces go even farther in specialization to bring the play indoors and will often charge admission as seen at [[Children's Museums]], [[Science museums|Science Centers]], or [[Family entertainment center|Family Entertainment Centers]]. Family Entertainment Centers (or Play Zones) are typically [[Business|For-Profit]] businesses purely for play and entertainment, while Children's Museums and Science Centers are typically [[Non-Profit]] organizations for educational entertainment.\n\nThe California-based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:<ref name=\"nifplay\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nifplay.org/science/pattern-play/ |title=The Science \u2013 Patterns of Play|author=National Institute for Play |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>\n# '''Attunement play''', which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.\n# '''Body play''', in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.\n# '''Object play''', such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.\n# '''Social play''', play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.\n# '''Imaginative or pretend play''', in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.\n# '''Storytelling play''', the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.\n# '''Creative play''', by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.\n\nSeparate from self-initiated play, [[play therapy]] is used as a clinical application of play aimed at treating children who suffer from trauma, emotional issues and other problems.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56767-652-5}}</ref>\n\n==Children==\n{{see|Children's games|Children's street culture|Make believe|Street games}}In young children, play is frequently associated with [[cognitive development]] and [[socialization]].

In the colonial era, toys were makeshift and children taught each other very simple games with little adult supervision. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the modern concept of childhood as a distinct, happy life stage. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted young girls. Organized sports filtered down from adults and colleges, and boys learned to play with a bat, a ball and an impromptu playing field. In the 20th century, teenagers were increasingly organized into club sports supervised and coached by adults, with swimming taught at [[summer camp]]s and through supervised playgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1|title=What Park Did You Hang Out At?|first=Stephanie|last=Warner}}</ref> Under the [[New Deal]]'s [[Works Progress Administration]], thousands of local playgrounds and ball fields opened, promoting softball especially as a sport for all ages and both sexes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} By the 21st century, Chudacoff notes, the old tension between parental controls and a child's individual freedom was being played out in [[cyberspace]].<ref>Chudacoff, Howard, ''Children at Play: An American History'' (2008).

More specifically, some studies indicate it could be the higher levels of inactivity within older adults that may have significant ramifications on their health and well-being.<ref name=\"seniors:1\" />\n\nWith attention to these hypotheses, research shows play and activity tend to decline with age<ref name=\":0\" /> which may result in negative outcomes such as social isolation, depression, and mobility issues.<ref name=\":2\" /> American studies found that only 24% of seniors took part in regular physical activity<ref name=\":2\" /> and only 42% use the internet for entertainment purposes.<ref name=\"seniors:4\" /> In comparison to other age groups, the elderly are more likely to experience a variety of barriers, such as difficulty with environmental hazards and accessibility related issues, that may hinder their abilities to execute healthy play behaviours.<ref name=\"seniors:1\" /><ref name=\"seniors:2\">{{cite journal|last1=Costello|first1=Ellen|last2=Kafchinski|first2=Marcia|last3=Vrazel|first3=JoEllen|last4=Sullivan|first4=Patricia|title=Motivators, Barriers, and Beliefs Regarding Physical Activity in an Older Adult Population|journal= Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy|date=2011|volume=34|issue=3|pages=138\u2013147|doi=10.1519/jpt.0b013e31820e0e71|pmid=21937904}}</ref> Similarly, although playing may benefit seniors, it also has the potential to negatively impact their health. For example, those who play may be more susceptible to injury.<ref name=\"seniors:1\" /><ref name=\"seniors:2\" /> Investigating these barriers may assist in the creation of useful interventions and/or the development of preventative measures, such as establishing safer recreational areas, that promote the maintenance of play behaviours throughout elderly life.<ref name=\"seniors:1\" />\n\nA significant amount of literature suggests a moderate level of play has numerous positive outcomes in the lives of senior citizens.<ref name=\"seniors :5\" /><ref name=\"seniors:1\" /><ref name=\"seniors:2\" /><ref name=\"seniors:4\" /> In order to support and promote play within the older population, studies suggest institutions should set up more diverse equipment,<ref name=\"seniors:3\" /><ref name=\"seniors:2\" /> improve conditions within recreational areas,<ref name=\"seniors:1\" /> and create more video games or online forums that appeal to the needs of seniors.<ref name=\"seniors:3\" /><ref name=\"seniors:4\" />\n\n==Animals==\n[[File:Cocker spaniel tearing at a monkey doll, 2015-01-02 02.jpg|thumbnail|[[Cocker Spaniel|Cocker spaniel]] playing with a monkey doll]]Evolutionary psychologists believe that there must be an important benefit of play, as there are so many reasons to avoid it. Animals are often injured during play, become distracted from predators, and expend valuable energy. In rare cases, play has even been observed between different species that are natural enemies such as a [[polar bear]] and a [[dog]].<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_brown_says_play_is_more_than_fun_it_s_vital.html \"Stuart Brown says play is more than fun,\"] TED talks</ref> Yet play seems to be a normal activity with animals who occupy the higher strata of their own hierarchy of needs. Animals on the lower strata, e.g. stressed and starving animals, generally do not play.<ref name=NYT/> However, in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s physically active play is performed also during periods of low food availability and even if it is at the expense of growth, which strongly highlights the developmental and evolutionary importance of play.<ref name = \"Bergh\u00e4nel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bergh\u00e4nel | first1 = A. | last2 = Sch\u00fclke | first2 = O. | last3 = Ostner | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Locomotor play drives motor skill acquisition at the expense of growth: A life history trade-off | url = | journal = Science Advances | volume = 1 | issue = 7| pages = 1\u20138 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1500451 | pmid = 26601237 | pmc = 4643810 }}</ref>\n\nThe social cognitive complexity of numerous species, including dogs, have recently been explored in experimental studies. In one such study, conducted by Alexandra Horowitz of the University of California, the communication and attention-getting skills of dogs were investigated. In a natural setting, dyadic play behavior was observed; head-direction and posture was specifically noted. When one of the two dogs was facing away or otherwise preoccupied, attention-getting behaviors and signals (nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc.) were used by the other dog to communicate the intent and/or desire to continue on with the dyadic play. Stronger or more frequent signaling was used if the attention of the other dog was not captured. These observations tell us that these dogs know how play behavior and signaling can be used to capture attention, communicate intent and desire, and manipulate one another. This characteristic and skill, called the \"attention-getting skill\" has generally only been seen in humans, but is now being researched and seen in many different species.\n\nObserving play behavior in various species can tell us a lot about the player's environment (including the welfare of the animal), personal needs, social rank (if any), immediate relationships, and eligibility for mating. Play activity, often observed through action and signals, often serves as a tool for communication and expression. Through mimicry, chasing, biting, and touching, animals will often act out in ways so as to send messages to one another; whether it's an alert, initiation of play, or expressing intent. When play behavior was observed for a study in [[Tonkean macaque]]s, it was discovered that play signals weren't always used to initiate play; rather, these signals were viewed primarily as methods of communication (sharing information and attention-getting). [[File:Jack Russell Terrier Eddi at the beach.JPG|right|thumb|A [[dog]] plays with a [[ball]].]]\n\nOne theory \u2013 \"play as preparation\" \u2013 was inspired by the observation that play often mimics adult themes of survival. [[Predator]]s such as [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s play by chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and biting, as they learn to stalk and kill prey. Prey animals such as [[deer]] and [[zebra]]s play by running and leaping as they acquire speed and agility. Hoofed mammals also practice kicking their hind legs to learn to ward off attacks. Indeed, time spent in physical play accelerates motor skill acquisition in wild [[Assamese macaque]]s.<ref name=\"Bergh\u00e4nel\" /> While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other. In social animals, playing might also help to establish dominance rankings among the young to avoid conflicts as adults.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nJohn Byers, a zoologist at the [[University of Idaho]], discovered that the amount of time spent at play for many mammals (e.g. rats and cats) peaks around puberty, and then drops off. This corresponds to the development of the [[cerebellum]], suggesting that play is not so much about practicing ''exact'' behaviors, as much as building general connections in the brain. Sergio Pellis and colleagues at the [[University of Lethbridge]] in Alberta, Canada, discovered that play may shape the brain in other ways, too. Young mammals have an overabundance of brain cells in their cerebrum (the outer areas of the brain&nbsp;\u2013 part of what distinguishes mammals). There is evidence that play helps the brain clean up this excess of cells, resulting in a more efficient cerebrum at maturity.<ref name=NYT/>{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = top\n| header = Humans and non-human animals playing in water\n| width1 = 306\n| image1 = Porto Covo July 2011-1.jpg\n| caption1 = Playing in the surf is among the favorite activities of children at the beach\n| width2 = 142\n| image2 = Dolphinsurfresize.jpg\n| caption2 = Dolphins playing in the surf\n}}\n\nMarc Bekoff (a [[University of Colorado]] evolutionary biologist) proposes a \"flexibility\" hypothesis that attempts to incorporate these newer neurological findings. It argues that play helps animals learn to switch and improvise all behaviors more effectively, to be prepared for the unexpected. There may, however, be other ways to acquire even these benefits of play: the concept of [[equifinality]]. The idea is that the social benefits of play for many animals, for example, could instead be garnered by grooming. Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid \"false endpoints\". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works \"well enough\", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.<ref name=NYT/> A study on two species of monkeys ''Semnopithecus entellus'' and ''Macaca mulatta'' that came into association with each other during food provisioning by pilgrims at the Ambagarh Forest Reserve, near Jaipur, India, shows the interspecific interaction that developed between the juveniles of the two species when opportunity presented itself.<ref>B.

Some of the earliest studies of play started in the 1890s with [[G. Stanley Hall]], the father of the child study movement that sparked an interest in the developmental, mental and behavioral world of babies and children. Play also promotes healthy development of parent-child bonds, establishing social, emotional and cognitive developmental milestones that help them relate to others, manage stress, and learn resiliency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ginsburg|first1=K.R.|year=2007|title=The Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds|journal=Pediatrics|volume=119|issue=1|pages=182\u2013191|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2697|pmid=17200287|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Genius of Play: Celebrating the Spirit of Childhood|author=Jenkinson, Sally|publisher=Hawthorn Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-903458-04-4|location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\nModern research in the field of [[affective neuroscience]] (the neural mechanisms of emotion) has uncovered important links between role play and neurogenesis in the brain.<ref>Panksepp, ''Affective Neuroscience 98''</ref> For example, researcher [[Roger Caillois]] used the word ''[[ilinx]]'' to describe the momentary disruption of perception that comes from forms of physical play that disorient the senses, especially balance.\n\nStudies have found that play and coping to daily stressors to be positively correlated in children.<ref>Goldstein & Russ, 2000\u20132001</ref><ref>Campos, Frankel, & Camras, 2004</ref> By playing, children regulate their emotions and this is important for adaptive functioning because without regulation, emotions could be overwhelming and stressful.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.\n\n=== Physical, mental and social ===\nVarious forms of play, whether it is physical or mental, have influenced cognitive abilities in individuals. As little as ten minutes of exercise (including physical play), can improve cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"cognitive:1\" >{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/2207676.2208323 | chapter=The acute cognitive benefits of casual exergame play | year=2012 | title=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  | page=1863 | last1 = Gao | first1 = Yue | last2 = Mandryk | first2 = Regan| isbn=978-1-4503-1015-4 | citeseerx=10.1.1.248.3183 }}</ref> These researchers did a study and have developed an \"exergame\" which is a game that incorporates some physical movement but is by no means formal exercise. These games increase one's heart rate to the level of aerobics exercise and have proven to result in recognizable improvements in mental faculties<ref name=\"cognitive:1\" />\nIn this study they use play in a way that incorporates physical activity that creates physical excursions. The results of the study had statistical significance. There were improvements in math by 3.4% and general improvements in recall memory by 4% among the participants of the study.<ref name=\"cognitive:1\" />\n\nOn the other hand, other research has focused on the cognitive effects of mentally stimulating play. Playing video games is one of the most common mediums of play for children and adults today. There has been mixed reviews on the effects of video games. Despite this, according to a research conducted by Hollis (2014),\n\"[playing video games] was positively associated with skills strongly related to academic success, such as time management, attention, executive control, memory, and spatial abilities \u2013 when playing [[video game]] occurs in moderation\".<ref>[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620743598 Hollis, S. D. (2014). Cognitive effects and academic consequences of video game playing (Order No. 1566326).]</ref>\n\nPlay can also influence one's social development and social interactions. Much of the research focuses on the influence play has on child social development. There are different forms of play that have been noted to influence child social development. One study conducted by (Sullivan, 2003) explores the influence of playing styles with mothers versus playing styles with fathers and how it influences child social development. This article explains that \"integral to positive development is the child's social competence or, more precisely, the ability to regulate their own emotions and behaviors in the social contexts of early childhood to support the effective accomplishment of relevant developmental tasks.<ref>Sinclair, J. et al. (1995). Exergame development using the dual flow model. Proc. IE 2009, 1-7.</ref>\n\nSocial benefits of play have been measured using basic interpersonal values such as getting along with peers.<ref name=\"social:4\">Sullivan, C. (2003).

ProQuest, UMI Dissertations.</ref> One of the social benefits that this researcher has uncovered is that play with parents has proven to reduce anxiety in children. Having play time with parents that involves socially acceptable behaviour makes it easier for children to relate to be more socially adjusted to peers at school or at play<ref name=\"social:4\" /> Social development involving child interaction with peers is thus an area of influence for playful interactions with parents and peers.\n\n=== Play in educational practices ===\n\n==== Anji play ====\nAnji play \u5b89\u5409\u6e38\u620f in simplified Chinese \u5b89\u5409\u904a\u6232 in traditional Chinese is an educational method based on children's self-directed play in outside spaces, using simple tools made of natural material. The teachers and instructors only observe and document the children's independent play. The method was created by Cheng Xueqin and is organized in two hours of free play when the children choose the available material they want to use and build structures to play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2016/08/10/child-s-play-preparations-for-future-success|title=Child's play preparations for future success|last=Euronews|date=2016-08-10|website=www.euronews.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\nWhile planning, experimenting, building and using the structures to play, the children have the opportunity to interact with peers, to think critically about what may work, to discuss the plan and organize the construction hard work. The process is observed and recorded by the teachers and instructors without intervention, even in instances of possible risk.\n\nBefore and after the two hours of play, the children have the opportunity to express their plans and discuss with their peers. After the play, they get the opportunity to draw, write or explain what they did. Then, they watch the videos recorded the same day and explain how they played and comment on each other's creations.\n\nAnji play is also called \u201ctrue play\u201d and its guiding principles are love, risk, joy, engagement, and reflection. This method of self-initiated and self-directed play is applied at the pre-schools (to children from 3 to 6 years-old) in Anji county, East China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AnjiPlay/how-did-anji-play-go-global-18e1e4bca996|title=How Did \"Anji Play\" Go Global?|last=Coffino|first=Jesse|date=2017-03-20|website=jesse coffino|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Caillois, R.
