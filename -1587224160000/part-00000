The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory or for [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]]'s location have not been found. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] depicts the island in ''[[Argonautica]]'' as a place visited by the Argonauts. [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] were married there in 'Medea's Cave'. Apollonius named the island ''Drepane'', Greek for \"sickle\", since it was thought to hide the sickle that [[Cronus]] used to castrate his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], from whose blood the Phaeacians were descended. In an alternative account, Apollonius identifies the buried sickle as a scythe belonging to [[Demeter]], yet the name ''Drepane'' probably originated in the sickle-shape of the island. According to a [[scholiast]], commenting on the passage in ''Argonautica'', the island was first of all called [[Macris]] after the nurse of [[Dionysus]] who fled there from [[Euboea]].<ref>W.H.

The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and [[Magna Grecia]], and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC according to [[Thucydides]]. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant [[Periander]] (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] and [[Anactorium]]. The island soon regained its independence and thenceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] over the control of [[Epidamnus]], and sought assistance from Athens (see [[Battle of Sybota]]).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the [[Peloponnesian War]], in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the [[Athens|Athenians]] as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC).<ref>Thucydides. \"The Revolution in Corcyra.\" c. 400 BCE.

In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a [[Sparta]]n force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the [[Hellenistic]] period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 303 BC, after a vain siege by [[Cassander]],<ref name=EB1911/> the island was occupied for a short time by the [[Lacedaemonian]] general [[Cleonymus of Sparta]], then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by [[Agathocles of Syracuse]]. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]] on her marriage to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], King of [[Epirus]]. The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of [[Cassiope(city)|Cassiope]] was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]], last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following the naval [[battle of Paxos]], it was captured by the [[Illyrians]], but was speedily delivered by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189 BC. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 BC it was attached to the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].<ref>''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1992.</ref> \nIn 31 BC, it served [[Augustus Caesar|Octavian]] (Augustus) as a base against [[Mark Antony]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Roman and medieval history===\n[[File:Pontikonisi Island 05-06-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pontikonisi]] island is home of the monastery of ''Pantokrator'' (\u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2).

Their relics were housed in the old cathedral (at the site of the current Old Fortress, before a dedicated church was built for them {{circa|100 AD}}.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nDuring [[Late Antiquity]] (late Roman/early Byzantine period), the island formed part of the province of [[Epirus Vetus]] in the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=28\u201329}} In 551, during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]], the [[Ostrogoths]] raided the island and destroyed the city of Corfu, then known as ''Chersoupolis'' (\u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, \"city on the promontory\") because of its location between Garitsa Bay and Kanoni. Over the next centuries, the main settlement was moved north, to the location of the current Old Fortress, where the rocky hills offered natural protection against raids. From the twin peaks of the new site, the medieval city received its new name, ''Korypho'' (\u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03ce, \"city on the peak\") or ''Korphoi'' (\u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03af, \"peaks\"), whence the modern Western name of \"Corfu\". The previous site of the city, now known as ''Palaiopolis'' (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, \"old city\"), continued to be inhabited for several centuries, however.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nFrom at least the early 9th century, Corfu and the other Ionian Islands formed part of the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Cephallenia (theme)|Cephallenia]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=30\u201331}} This naval theme provided a defensive bulwark for Byzantium against western threats, but also played a major role in securing the sealanes to the Byzantine [[Catepanate of Italy|possessions in southern Italy]]. Indeed, traveller reports from throughout the middle Byzantine period (8th\u201312th centuries) make clear that Corfu was \"an important staging post for travels between East and West\".{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=31\u201332, 33\u201334}} Indeed, the medieval name of Corfu first appears (Latinized ''Coryphus'') in [[Liutprand of Cremona]]'s account of his 968 embassy to the Byzantine court.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=35}} Corfu enjoyed relative peace and safety during the [[Macedonian dynasty]] (867\u20131054), which allowed the construction of a monumental church to Saints Iason and Sosipatrus outside the city wall of Palaiopolis.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=35}} Nevertheless, in 933, the city, led by its archbishop, Arsenios, withstood a [[Saracen]] attack; Arsenios was canonized and became the city's [[patron saint]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=34}}\n\nThe peace and prosperity of the Macedonian era ended with another Saracen attack in 1033, but more importantly with the emergence of a new threat: following the [[Norman conquest of Southern Italy]], the ambitious Norman monarchs set their sights on expansion in the East. Three times on the space of a century Corfu was the first target and served as a staging area for the [[Byzantine\u2013Norman wars|Norman invasions of Byzantium]]. The first Norman occupation from 1081 to 1084 was ended only after the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] secured the aid of the [[Republic of Venice]], in exchange to wide-ranging commercial concessions to Venetian merchants. The admiral [[George of Antioch]] captured Corfu again in 1147, and it took a ten-month siege for [[Manuel I Komnenos]] to recover the island in 1149.

It began on 29 August 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Ottoman fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n\nThirty-four years later, in August 1571, Ottoman forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized [[Parga]] and [[Mourtos]] from the Greek mainland side, they attacked the [[Paxi]] islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu's southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu's eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building engineering skills. Another castle, [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]], situated on the northwest coast near [[Palaiokastritsa]] (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 meaning ''Old Castle place'') and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, also held out. The castle is a tourist attraction today.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n \nThese defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive, and the Ottomans abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later they repeated their attempt. Coming from Africa after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas. Following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces, the Ottoman troops were forced to leave the city sailing away.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n\n[[File:Gardiki Castle.jpg|thumb|Outer perimeter of the [[Gardiki Castle, Corfu|Gardiki Castle]] which provided defence to the southern part of the island.]]\n\nThe [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|second great siege]] of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u201318)]]. After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in [[Buthrotum]] opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Ottoman fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Buthrotum and established a beachhead at Ipsos.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/> The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Ottoman fleet off the [[Corfu Channel]] and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Ottomans were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|von der Schulenburg]] who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more.<ref name=\"History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website\"/><ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/><ref name=\"History of Corfu from xenos website\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070814153129/http://www.corfuxenos.gr/History/venetian.htm History of Corfu from xenos website]</ref> The success was owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds.

From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. It was in the Venetian period that the city saw the erection of the first opera house ([[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]]) in Greece.\n\nMany Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries; they were called [[Corfiot Italians]], and until the second half of the 20th century the ''[[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]]'' was spoken in Corfu. During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer [[Felice Beato]] (1832\u20131909) is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu. Also many [[Italian Jews]] took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language ([[Italkian]]), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.\n\nVenetians promoted the [[Catholic Church]] during their four centuries of rule in Corfu. Today the majority of Corfiots are [[Greek Orthodox]], but the small Catholic minority (5%), living harmoniously with the Orthodox community, owes its faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from [[Malta]], but also from [[Italy]], and today the Catholic community numbers about 4,000 ({{frac|2|3}} of Maltese descent), who live almost exclusively in the Venetian \"Citadel\" of [[Corfu City]]. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate Easter using the same calendar as the [[Greek Orthodox]] church. The [[Cathedral of Saint James and Saint Christopher|Cathedral of St. James and St. Christopher]] in Corfu City is the see of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Corfu, Zakynthos and Cephalonia]].\n\nThe island served also as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732, it became the home of the first academy of modern Greece.<ref name=EB1911/> A Corfu cleric and scholar, [[Nikephoros Theotokis]] (1732\u20131800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in Russia (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.\n\nThe island's culture absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways; like other Ionian islands (see [[Cuisine of the Ionian islands]]), its local cuisine took in such elements and today's Corfiot cooking includes Venetian delicacies and recipes: \"[[Pastitsada]]\", deriving from the Venetian \"Pastissada\" (Italian: \"Spezzatino\") and the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, \"[[Sofrito]]\", \"[[Strapatsada]]\", \"Savoro\", \"Bianco\" and \"Mandolato\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Corfu Pinargenti 1573.jpg|Venetian [[Old Fortress]], Map 1573\nFile:Venetian blazon in Corfu.jpg|Venetian [[blazon]] with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], as frequently found on the [[New Fortress]] walls.\nFile:\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u039d\u03ad\u03bf \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf.JPG|Panoramic view of [[Corfu (city)]] from the New Fortress.\nFile:Detail of the south wing of the entrance at Kassiopi Castle.JPG|Detail of the south wing of the entrance at Kassiopi Castle\nFile:View of Kassiopi village from the castle.JPG|View of Kasiopi village from the castle\n</gallery>\n\n===19th century===\n{{further|French departments of Greece|Septinsular Republic|United States of the Ionian Islands}}\n[[File:Russian-Gun-on-Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|A Russian Gun from the Russian-Ottoman occupation of Corfu in the beginning of the 19th century, [[Paleokastritsa]].]]\n\nBy the 1797 [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Corfu was ceded to the [[French Revolution|French]], who occupied it for two years as the ''[[French departments of Greece|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Corcyre]], until they were [[Siege of Corfu (1798\u20131799)|expelled]] by a joint [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n-Ottoman squadron under [[Admiral Ushakov]]. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the [[Septinsular Republic|Heptanesos]] (\"Seven Islands\"), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot]], and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] of 5 November 1815 as the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]. Corfu became the seat of the British [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands]].<ref name=EB1911/> The period of British rule is sometimes considered a prosperous period for Corfu when we consider new roads, an improved water supply system, and the building of the first Greek university to be a sign of prosperity. During this period the [[Greek language]] became official.\n\nFollowing a plebiscite the [[Second National Assembly of the Greeks at Athens]] elected a new king, Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name George I and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]], pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 21 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n\n====British Lord High Commissioners during the protectorate====\n[[File:Maitland Monument in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|The Maitland Monument in Corfu town, built to commemorate [[Sir Thomas Maitland]].]]\n\nThis is a list of the British High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands; (as well as the transitional Greek Governor, appointed a year prior to Enosis (Union) with Greece in 1864).<ref name=\"Catalan wiki\">[[:ca:Hist\u00f2ria de Corf\u00fa]]</ref>\n\n* [[Sir James Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir James Campbell]] 1814\u20131816\n* [[Sir Thomas Maitland]] (1759\u20131824) 1815\u20131823\n* [[Frederick Adam|Sir Frederick Adam]] (1781\u20131853) 1823\u20131832\n* [[Alexander Woodford|Sir Alexander Woodford]] (1782\u20131870) 1832\n* [[George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent]] (1788\u20131850) 1832\u20131835\n* [[Howard Douglas]] (1776\u20131861) 1835\u20131840\n* [[James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie]] (1784\u20131843) 1840\u20131843\n* [[John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton]] (1778\u20131863) 1843\u20131849\n* [[Henry George Ward|Sir Henry George Ward]] (1797\u20131860) 1849\u20131855\n* [[John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar|Sir John Young]] (1807\u20131876) 1855\u20131859\n* [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (1809\u20131898) 1859\n* [[Henry Knight Storks|Sir Henry Knight Storks]] (1811\u20131874) 1859\u20131863\n* Count Dimitrios Nikolaou Karousos, President of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Ionian Parliament]] (1799\u20131873) 1863\u20131864\n\n=== First World War ===\n{{further|Serbian army's retreat through Albania}}[[File:Serbs Corfu1916-1918.jpg|thumb|Serbian soldiers in Corfu during WWI]]\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], the island served as a refuge for the Serbian army that retreated there on [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces' ships from a homeland occupied by the Austrians, Germans and [[Bulgarians]].

The architecture of the Old Town of Corfu along with its narrow streets, the ''kantounia'', has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. Other notable Venetian-era buildings include the [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]], the first Greek opera house, and ''Liston'', a multi-level commercial and residential building, with an arched colonnade at ground level, lined with cafes and restaurants on its east side, and restaurants and other stores on its west side. Liston's main thoroughfare is often the site of parades and other mass gatherings. Liston is on the edge of the ''[[Spianada]]'' (Esplanade), the vast main plaza and park which incorporates a [[cricket]] field, a pavilion, and Maitland's monument. Also notable are the Old and New forts, the recently restored Palace of Sts. Michael and George, formerly the residence of the British governor and the seat of the [[Ionian Senate]], and the summer Palace of ''[[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]]'', formerly the property of the Greek royal family and birthplace of the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. The Park of Mon Repos is built on part of the Palaiopolis of Kerkyra, where excavations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service in collaboration with academics and universities internationally. Examples of the finds can be found in the Museum of the Palace of Mon Repos and at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].<ref name=\"Artifacts\">R. Winkes (editor), Kerkyra.

The structure is filled with paintings and statues of Achilles, both in the main hall and in the gardens, depicting scenes of the [[Trojan War]].  The palace, with the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Greek statues that surround it, is a monument to [[Platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]] as well as [[escapism]]. It served as a refuge for the grieving Empress following the tragic death of her only son and [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince, Rudolf]].\n\n[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the Achilleion.

It was commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II.]]\n\nThe Imperial gardens on the hill look over the surrounding green hills and valleys and the [[Ionian sea]]. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0391\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u0398\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd, ''Achille\u00fas Thn\u0113sk\u014dn'', Achilles Dying) without [[hubris]] and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek [[hoplite]] helmet. This statue was carved by German sculptor [[Ernst Gustav Herter]].\n\nThe hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]'s arrow from his heel. His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes skyward, as if to seek help from [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]]. According to [[Greek mythology]], his mother [[Thetis]] was a goddess.\n\nIn 1898, Empress Sissi was assassinated at the age of 60 by an Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Lucheni]], in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. After her death, the palace was sold to the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiser]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. In contrast, at the great staircase in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of [[hubris|pride]]. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, he pulls the lifeless body of [[Hector of Troy]] in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.\n\nFollowing the Kaiser's purchase of the Achilleion, he invited archaeologist [[Reinhard Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz]], a friend and advisor, to come to Corfu to advise him where to position the huge statue of Achilles which he commissioned. The famous salute to Achilles from the Kaiser, which had been inscribed at the statue's base, was also created by Kekul\u00e9.

The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains, a monument to imperial vanity, are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge's central section was demolished by the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1944, during the German occupation of World War II, to allow for the passage of an enormous cannon, forming part of the Nazi defences in the southeastern coast of Corfu.<ref name=\"GilesFlamburiari1994\">{{cite book|author1=Frank Giles|author2=Spiro Flamburiari|author3=Fritz Von der Schulenburg|title=Corfu: the garden isle|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Evs-AQAAIAAJ&q=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu&dq=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=1 September 1994|page=109|publisher=J.

In several parts of the old city, buildings of the [[Venice|Venetian]] era are to be found. The old city's architectural character is strongly influenced by the Venetian style, coming as it did under Venetian rule for a long period; its small and ancient side streets, and the old buildings' trademark arches are particularly reminiscent of [[Venice]].\n\nThe city of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a seawater moat at the bottom,<ref name=EB1911/> that now serves as a [[marina]] and is called the ''Contrafossa''. In the old town there are many narrow streets paved with cobblestones.

A promenade rises by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa (\u0393\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1), together with an esplanade between the city and the citadel known as ''Spianada'' with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} arcade ({{lang-el|\u039b\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd}}) to its west side, where restaurants and bistros abound.<ref name=\"Independent\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/holidays/family-holidays/the-complete-guide-to-corfu-851348.html The Independent] Complete Guide to Corfu</ref>\n\n===Ano and Kato Plateia and the music pavilion===\n{{main|Spianada}}\n[[File:Music Pavilion in Corfu.JPG|thumb|240px|The Music Pavilion in [[Spianada Square]] (Ano Plateia) with Palaio Frourio in the background.

Today the palace is open to the public and forms a complex of halls and buildings housing art exhibits, including a [[Museum of Asian Art (Corfu)|Museum of Asian Art]], unique across Southern Europe in its scope and in the richness of its Chinese and Asian exhibits. The gardens of the Palaces, complete with old Venetian stone aquariums, exotic trees and flowers, overlook the bay through old Venetian fortifications and turrets, and the local sea baths (\u039c\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4' \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5) are at the foot of the fortifications surrounding the gardens. A caf\u00e9 on the grounds includes its own [[art gallery]], with exhibitions of both local and international artists, known locally as the Art Caf\u00e9.

The castle never fell, despite frequent sieges and attempts at conquering it through the centuries, and played a decisive role in defending the island against pirate incursions and during three sieges of Corfu by the Ottomans, significantly contributing to their defeat. During invasions it helped shelter the local peasant population. The villagers also fought against the invaders playing an active role in the defence of the castle. Angelokastro, located at the western frontier of the Empire, was instrumental in repulsing the Ottomans during the first great siege of Corfu in 1537, in the siege of 1571 and the second great siege of Corfu in 1716 causing the Ottomans to fail at penetrating the defences of Corfu in the North.

For Corfiotes a recent example of such heroism is that of geology student [[Kostas Georgakis]], who set himself ablaze in [[Genoa]], Italy on 19 September 1970, in a protest against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].\n\n==Culture==\nCorfu has a long musical, theatrical, and operatic tradition. The operas performed in Corfu were at par with their European counterparts. The phrase \"applaudito in Corfu\" (applauded in Corfu) was a measure of high accolade for an opera performed on the island. The [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]] was the first theatre and [[opera]] house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]) was performed.\n\n=== Museums and libraries ===\n[[File:Gorgon at the Archaeological Museum in Corfu.jpg|thumb|The [[Gorgon]] as depicted on the western [[pediment]] from the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Temple of Artemis]], on display at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].]]\n\nThe most notable of Corfu's museums and libraries are located in the city, and are:<ref name=\"Libraries and Museums from City Hall website\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080106230632/http://www.corfu.gr/en/tourism/archives.htm Libraries and Museums from the City Hall website]</ref>\n\n* [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu|The Archaeological Museum]], inaugurated in 1967, was constructed to house the exhibit of the huge [[Gorgon]] [[pediment]] of the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis temple in the ancient city of Korkyra]], excavated at Palaiopolis in the early 20th century.

Venice honoured von der Schulenburg and the Corfiots for successfully defending the island. Recognizing St. Spyridon's role in the defence of the island Venice legislated the establishment of the litany (\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) of St Spyridon on 11 August as a commemoration of the miraculous event, inaugurating a tradition that continues to this day.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/> In 1716 [[Antonio Vivaldi]], on commission by the republic of Venice, composed the [[oratorio]] [[Juditha triumphans]] to commemorate this great event. ''Juditha triumphans'' was first performed in November 1716 in [[Venice]] by the orchestra and choir of the [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] and is described as Vivaldi's first great oratorio.<ref name=\"Baroque music\">[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html Baroque Music] ''As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 perform his first great oratorio, Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric {{sic}}. This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians (the Christians) over the Turks (the barbarians) in August 1716.''</ref>\nHence Spyridon is a very popular first name for Greek males born on the island and/or to islanders.\n\n===Music===\n\n====Musical history====\n[[File:Manzaro.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], major representative of the [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian School of music]]]]\n\nWhile much of present-day Greece was under Ottoman rule, the Ionian Islands enjoyed a Golden Age in music and opera. Corfu was the capital city of a Venetian protectorate and it benefited from a unique musical and theatrical heritage. Then in the 19th century, as a [[Protectorate|British Protectorate]], Corfu developed a musical heritage of its own and which constitutes the nucleus of modern Greek musical history. Until the early 18th century, musical life took place in city and village squares, with performances of straight or musical comedies \u2013 known as Momaries or Bobaries. From 1720, Corfu became the possessor of the first theatre in post-1452 Greece. It was the Teatro San Giacomo (now the City Hall) named after the nearby Roman Catholic cathedral (completed in 1691).<ref>Corfu the Garden Isle, editor Frank Giles, John Murray 1994, {{ISBN|0-7195-5375-X}}</ref>\n\nThe island was also the center of the [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian School of music]], the musical production of a group of Heptanesian composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. It was the first school of classical music in Greece and it was a heavy influence for the later Greek music scene, after the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]].\n\n====The three Philharmonics====\n[[File:Corfu Marching Band.JPG|thumb|A marching band from [[Austria]], a frequent visitor, through the Corfu landmark of {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}}.

There are nineteen such marching wind bands throughout the island. <br />Corfu city is home to the three most prestigious bands \u2013 in order of seniority:\n* the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]] use dark blue uniforms with dark red accents, and blue and red helmet plumes. It is usually called the ''Old Philharmonic'' or simply the ''Pali\u00e1'' (\"Old\"). Founded 12 September 1840.\n* the [[Nikolaos Mantzaros|Mantzaros]] Philharmonic Society use blue uniforms with blue and white helmet plumes. It is commonly called the ''N\u00e9a'' (\"New\"). Founded 25 October 1890.\n* the [[John Capodistria|Capodistria]] Philharmonic Union use bright red and black uniforms and plumes. It is commonly called the ''C\u00f3nte Capod\u00edstria'' or simply the ''C\u00f3nte'' (\"[[Count]]\"). It is the juniormost of the three (founded 18 April 1980).\nAll three maintain two major bands each, the main marching bands that can field up to 200 musicians on grand occasions, and the 60-strong student ''bandinas'' meant for lighter fare and on-the-job training.\n\nThe bands give regular summer weekend promenade concerts at the Spianada Green [[gazebo|\"''p\u00e1lko''\"]], and have a prominent part in the yearly Holy Week ceremonies.\n\n====Ionian University music department====\n[[File:Ionian University Music Laboratory.jpg|thumb|The music lab of the Ionian university located at the old fortress]]\nSince the early 1990s a music department has been established at the [[Ionian University]].

The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.\n\nThe litany is followed by the celebration of the \"Early Resurrection\"; balconies in the old city are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the ''b\u00f3tides'', \u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} and in an organised fashion.<ref name=\"Easter\"/> This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night,<ref name=\"Easter\"/> and to commemorate [[King David]]'s phrase: \"Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel\" ([[Psalm 2]]:9).\n\nOnce the ''b\u00f3tides'' commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous \"''Graiko\u00ed''\" festive march.<ref name=\"Band rivalry\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE1yagErUbQ As the Old Philharmonic concludes its marching in front of their building with a hearty rendition of the ''Graiko\u00ed'' March, the New Philharmonic appears and \"salutes\" their rivals with yet another rendition of the same march]</ref> This legendary march, the anthem of the island, was composed during Venetian rule, and its lyrics urged: \"Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free\". The Venetians were replaced by the French and the French by the British, and both the lyrics and the performance of the march were officially banned.

Medieval castles punctuating strategic locations across the island are a legacy of struggles in the Middle Ages against invasions by pirates and the Ottomans. Two of these castles enclose its capital, which is the only city in Greece to be surrounded in such a way.

Unification with [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|modern Greece]] was concluded in 1864 under the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]].

The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory or for [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]]'s location have not been found. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] depicts the island in ''[[Argonautica]]'' as a place visited by the Argonauts. [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] were married there in 'Medea's Cave'. Apollonius named the island ''Drepane'', Greek for \"sickle\", since it was thought to hide the sickle that [[Cronus]] used to castrate his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], from whose blood the Phaeacians were descended. In an alternative account, Apollonius identifies the buried sickle as a scythe belonging to [[Demeter]], yet the name ''Drepane'' probably originated in the sickle-shape of the island. According to a [[scholiast]], commenting on the passage in ''Argonautica'', the island was first of all called [[Macris]] after the nurse of [[Dionysus]] who fled there from [[Euboea]].<ref>W.H.

The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and [[Magna Grecia]], and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC according to [[Thucydides]]. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant [[Periander]] (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] and [[Anactorium]]. The island soon regained its independence and thenceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] over the control of [[Epidamnus]], and sought assistance from Athens (see [[Battle of Sybota]]).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThis new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the [[Peloponnesian War]], in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the [[Athens|Athenians]] as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC).<ref>Thucydides. \"The Revolution in Corcyra.\" c. 400 BCE.

In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a [[Sparta]]n force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the [[Hellenistic]] period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 303 BC, after a vain siege by [[Cassander]],<ref name=EB1911/> the island was occupied for a short time by the [[Lacedaemonian]] general [[Cleonymus of Sparta]], then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by [[Agathocles of Syracuse]]. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]] on her marriage to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], King of [[Epirus]]. The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of [[Cassiope(city)|Cassiope]] was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]], last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following the naval [[battle of Paxos]], it was captured by the [[Illyrians]], but was speedily delivered by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189 BC. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 BC it was attached to the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].<ref>''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1992.</ref> \nIn 31 BC, it served [[Augustus Caesar|Octavian]] (Augustus) as a base against [[Mark Antony]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Roman and medieval history===\n[[File:Pontikonisi Island 05-06-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pontikonisi]] island is home of the monastery of ''Pantokrator'' (\u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2).

Over the next centuries, the main settlement was moved north, to the location of the current Old Fortress, where the rocky hills offered natural protection against raids. From the twin peaks of the new site, the medieval city received its new name, ''Korypho'' (\u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03ce, \"city on the peak\") or ''Korphoi'' (\u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03bf\u03af, \"peaks\"), whence the modern Western name of \"Corfu\".

Indeed, traveller reports from throughout the middle Byzantine period (8th\u201312th centuries) make clear that Corfu was \"an important staging post for travels between East and West\".{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|pp=31\u201332, 33\u201334}} Indeed, the medieval name of Corfu first appears (Latinized ''Coryphus'') in [[Liutprand of Cremona]]'s account of his 968 embassy to the Byzantine court.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=35}} Corfu enjoyed relative peace and safety during the [[Macedonian dynasty]] (867\u20131054), which allowed the construction of a monumental church to Saints Iason and Sosipatrus outside the city wall of Palaiopolis.{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=35}} Nevertheless, in 933, the city, led by its archbishop, Arsenios, withstood a [[Saracen]] attack; Arsenios was canonized and became the city's [[patron saint]].{{sfn|Leontsini|2014|p=34}}\n\nThe peace and prosperity of the Macedonian era ended with another Saracen attack in 1033, but more importantly with the emergence of a new threat: following the [[Norman conquest of Southern Italy]], the ambitious Norman monarchs set their sights on expansion in the East. Three times on the space of a century Corfu was the first target and served as a staging area for the [[Byzantine\u2013Norman wars|Norman invasions of Byzantium]]. The first Norman occupation from 1081 to 1084 was ended only after the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] secured the aid of the [[Republic of Venice]], in exchange to wide-ranging commercial concessions to Venetian merchants. The admiral [[George of Antioch]] captured Corfu again in 1147, and it took a ten-month siege for [[Manuel I Komnenos]] to recover the island in 1149.

It began on 29 August 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Ottoman fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n\nThirty-four years later, in August 1571, Ottoman forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized [[Parga]] and [[Mourtos]] from the Greek mainland side, they attacked the [[Paxi]] islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu's southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu's eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building engineering skills. Another castle, [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]], situated on the northwest coast near [[Palaiokastritsa]] (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 meaning ''Old Castle place'') and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, also held out. The castle is a tourist attraction today.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n \nThese defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive, and the Ottomans abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later they repeated their attempt. Coming from Africa after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas. Following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces, the Ottoman troops were forced to leave the city sailing away.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n\n[[File:Gardiki Castle.jpg|thumb|Outer perimeter of the [[Gardiki Castle, Corfu|Gardiki Castle]] which provided defence to the southern part of the island.]]\n\nThe [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|second great siege]] of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u201318)]]. After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in [[Buthrotum]] opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Ottoman fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Buthrotum and established a beachhead at Ipsos.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/> The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Ottoman fleet off the [[Corfu Channel]] and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Ottomans were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|von der Schulenburg]] who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more.<ref name=\"History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website\"/><ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/><ref name=\"History of Corfu from xenos website\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070814153129/http://www.corfuxenos.gr/History/venetian.htm History of Corfu from xenos website]</ref> The success was owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds.

From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. It was in the Venetian period that the city saw the erection of the first opera house ([[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]]) in Greece.\n\nMany Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries; they were called [[Corfiot Italians]], and until the second half of the 20th century the ''[[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]]'' was spoken in Corfu. During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer [[Felice Beato]] (1832\u20131909) is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu. Also many [[Italian Jews]] took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language ([[Italkian]]), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.\n\nVenetians promoted the [[Catholic Church]] during their four centuries of rule in Corfu. Today the majority of Corfiots are [[Greek Orthodox]], but the small Catholic minority (5%), living harmoniously with the Orthodox community, owes its faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from [[Malta]], but also from [[Italy]], and today the Catholic community numbers about 4,000 ({{frac|2|3}} of Maltese descent), who live almost exclusively in the Venetian \"Citadel\" of [[Corfu City]]. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate Easter using the same calendar as the [[Greek Orthodox]] church. The [[Cathedral of Saint James and Saint Christopher|Cathedral of St. James and St. Christopher]] in Corfu City is the see of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Corfu, Zakynthos and Cephalonia]].\n\nThe island served also as a refuge for Greek scholars, and in 1732, it became the home of the first academy of modern Greece.<ref name=EB1911/> A Corfu cleric and scholar, [[Nikephoros Theotokis]] (1732\u20131800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in Russia (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.\n\nThe island's culture absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways; like other Ionian islands (see [[Cuisine of the Ionian islands]]), its local cuisine took in such elements and today's Corfiot cooking includes Venetian delicacies and recipes: \"[[Pastitsada]]\", deriving from the Venetian \"Pastissada\" (Italian: \"Spezzatino\") and the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, \"[[Sofrito]]\", \"[[Strapatsada]]\", \"Savoro\", \"Bianco\" and \"Mandolato\".\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Corfu Pinargenti 1573.jpg|Venetian [[Old Fortress]], Map 1573\nFile:Venetian blazon in Corfu.jpg|Venetian [[blazon]] with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], as frequently found on the [[New Fortress]] walls.\nFile:\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac \u03a0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u039d\u03ad\u03bf \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf.JPG|Panoramic view of [[Corfu (city)]] from the New Fortress.\nFile:Detail of the south wing of the entrance at Kassiopi Castle.JPG|Detail of the south wing of the entrance at Kassiopi Castle\nFile:View of Kassiopi village from the castle.JPG|View of Kasiopi village from the castle\n</gallery>\n\n===19th century===\n{{further|French departments of Greece|Septinsular Republic|United States of the Ionian Islands}}\n[[File:Russian-Gun-on-Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|A Russian Gun from the Russian-Ottoman occupation of Corfu in the beginning of the 19th century, [[Paleokastritsa]].]]\n\nBy the 1797 [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Corfu was ceded to the [[French Revolution|French]], who occupied it for two years as the ''[[French departments of Greece|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Corcyre]], until they were [[Siege of Corfu (1798\u20131799)|expelled]] by a joint [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n-Ottoman squadron under [[Admiral Ushakov]]. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the [[Septinsular Republic|Heptanesos]] (\"Seven Islands\"), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot]], and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] of 5 November 1815 as the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]. Corfu became the seat of the British [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands]].<ref name=EB1911/> The period of British rule is sometimes considered a prosperous period for Corfu when we consider new roads, an improved water supply system, and the building of the first Greek university to be a sign of prosperity. During this period the [[Greek language]] became official.\n\nFollowing a plebiscite the [[Second National Assembly of the Greeks at Athens]] elected a new king, Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name George I and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]], pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 21 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/>\n\n====British Lord High Commissioners during the protectorate====\n[[File:Maitland Monument in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|The Maitland Monument in Corfu town, built to commemorate [[Sir Thomas Maitland]].]]\n\nThis is a list of the British High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands; (as well as the transitional Greek Governor, appointed a year prior to Enosis (Union) with Greece in 1864).<ref name=\"Catalan wiki\">[[:ca:Hist\u00f2ria de Corf\u00fa]]</ref>\n\n* [[Sir James Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir James Campbell]] 1814\u20131816\n* [[Sir Thomas Maitland]] (1759\u20131824) 1815\u20131823\n* [[Frederick Adam|Sir Frederick Adam]] (1781\u20131853) 1823\u20131832\n* [[Alexander Woodford|Sir Alexander Woodford]] (1782\u20131870) 1832\n* [[George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent]] (1788\u20131850) 1832\u20131835\n* [[Howard Douglas]] (1776\u20131861) 1835\u20131840\n* [[James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie]] (1784\u20131843) 1840\u20131843\n* [[John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton]] (1778\u20131863) 1843\u20131849\n* [[Henry George Ward|Sir Henry George Ward]] (1797\u20131860) 1849\u20131855\n* [[John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar|Sir John Young]] (1807\u20131876) 1855\u20131859\n* [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (1809\u20131898) 1859\n* [[Henry Knight Storks|Sir Henry Knight Storks]] (1811\u20131874) 1859\u20131863\n* Count Dimitrios Nikolaou Karousos, President of the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Ionian Parliament]] (1799\u20131873) 1863\u20131864\n\n=== First World War ===\n{{further|Serbian army's retreat through Albania}}[[File:Serbs Corfu1916-1918.jpg|thumb|Serbian soldiers in Corfu during WWI]]\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], the island served as a refuge for the Serbian army that retreated there on [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces' ships from a homeland occupied by the Austrians, Germans and [[Bulgarians]].

The architecture of the Old Town of Corfu along with its narrow streets, the ''kantounia'', has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. Other notable Venetian-era buildings include the [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]], the first Greek opera house, and ''Liston'', a multi-level commercial and residential building, with an arched colonnade at ground level, lined with cafes and restaurants on its east side, and restaurants and other stores on its west side. Liston's main thoroughfare is often the site of parades and other mass gatherings. Liston is on the edge of the ''[[Spianada]]'' (Esplanade), the vast main plaza and park which incorporates a [[cricket]] field, a pavilion, and Maitland's monument. Also notable are the Old and New forts, the recently restored Palace of Sts. Michael and George, formerly the residence of the British governor and the seat of the [[Ionian Senate]], and the summer Palace of ''[[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]]'', formerly the property of the Greek royal family and birthplace of the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. The Park of Mon Repos is built on part of the Palaiopolis of Kerkyra, where excavations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service in collaboration with academics and universities internationally. Examples of the finds can be found in the Museum of the Palace of Mon Repos and at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].<ref name=\"Artifacts\">R. Winkes (editor), Kerkyra.

The structure is filled with paintings and statues of Achilles, both in the main hall and in the gardens, depicting scenes of the [[Trojan War]].  The palace, with the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Greek statues that surround it, is a monument to [[Platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]] as well as [[escapism]]. It served as a refuge for the grieving Empress following the tragic death of her only son and [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince, Rudolf]].\n\n[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the Achilleion.

It was commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II.]]\n\nThe Imperial gardens on the hill look over the surrounding green hills and valleys and the [[Ionian sea]]. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0391\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u0398\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd, ''Achille\u00fas Thn\u0113sk\u014dn'', Achilles Dying) without [[hubris]] and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek [[hoplite]] helmet. This statue was carved by German sculptor [[Ernst Gustav Herter]].\n\nThe hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]'s arrow from his heel. His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes skyward, as if to seek help from [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]]. According to [[Greek mythology]], his mother [[Thetis]] was a goddess.\n\nIn 1898, Empress Sissi was assassinated at the age of 60 by an Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Lucheni]], in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. After her death, the palace was sold to the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiser]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. In contrast, at the great staircase in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of [[hubris|pride]]. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, he pulls the lifeless body of [[Hector of Troy]] in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.\n\nFollowing the Kaiser's purchase of the Achilleion, he invited archaeologist [[Reinhard Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz]], a friend and advisor, to come to Corfu to advise him where to position the huge statue of Achilles which he commissioned. The famous salute to Achilles from the Kaiser, which had been inscribed at the statue's base, was also created by Kekul\u00e9.

The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains, a monument to imperial vanity, are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge's central section was demolished by the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1944, during the German occupation of World War II, to allow for the passage of an enormous cannon, forming part of the Nazi defences in the southeastern coast of Corfu.<ref name=\"GilesFlamburiari1994\">{{cite book|author1=Frank Giles|author2=Spiro Flamburiari|author3=Fritz Von der Schulenburg|title=Corfu: the garden isle|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Evs-AQAAIAAJ&q=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu&dq=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=1 September 1994|page=109|publisher=J.

In several parts of the old city, buildings of the [[Venice|Venetian]] era are to be found. The old city's architectural character is strongly influenced by the Venetian style, coming as it did under Venetian rule for a long period; its small and ancient side streets, and the old buildings' trademark arches are particularly reminiscent of [[Venice]].\n\nThe city of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc \u03a6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a seawater moat at the bottom,<ref name=EB1911/> that now serves as a [[marina]] and is called the ''Contrafossa''. In the old town there are many narrow streets paved with cobblestones.

A promenade rises by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa (\u0393\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1), together with an esplanade between the city and the citadel known as ''Spianada'' with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} arcade ({{lang-el|\u039b\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd}}) to its west side, where restaurants and bistros abound.<ref name=\"Independent\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/holidays/family-holidays/the-complete-guide-to-corfu-851348.html The Independent] Complete Guide to Corfu</ref>\n\n===Ano and Kato Plateia and the music pavilion===\n{{main|Spianada}}\n[[File:Music Pavilion in Corfu.JPG|thumb|240px|The Music Pavilion in [[Spianada Square]] (Ano Plateia) with Palaio Frourio in the background.

Today the palace is open to the public and forms a complex of halls and buildings housing art exhibits, including a [[Museum of Asian Art (Corfu)|Museum of Asian Art]], unique across Southern Europe in its scope and in the richness of its Chinese and Asian exhibits. The gardens of the Palaces, complete with old Venetian stone aquariums, exotic trees and flowers, overlook the bay through old Venetian fortifications and turrets, and the local sea baths (\u039c\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4' \u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5) are at the foot of the fortifications surrounding the gardens. A caf\u00e9 on the grounds includes its own [[art gallery]], with exhibitions of both local and international artists, known locally as the Art Caf\u00e9. From the same spot, the viewer can observe ships passing through the narrow channel of the historic [[Vido|Vido island]] (\u039d\u03b7\u03c3\u03af \u0392\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5) to the north, on their way to Corfu harbour (\u039d\u03ad\u03bf \u039b\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9), with high speed retractable [[aerofoil]] ferries from [[Igoumenitsa]] also cutting across the panorama.

The castle never fell, despite frequent sieges and attempts at conquering it through the centuries, and played a decisive role in defending the island against pirate incursions and during three sieges of Corfu by the Ottomans, significantly contributing to their defeat. During invasions it helped shelter the local peasant population. The villagers also fought against the invaders playing an active role in the defence of the castle. Angelokastro, located at the western frontier of the Empire, was instrumental in repulsing the Ottomans during the first great siege of Corfu in 1537, in the siege of 1571 and the second great siege of Corfu in 1716 causing the Ottomans to fail at penetrating the defences of Corfu in the North.

For Corfiotes a recent example of such heroism is that of geology student [[Kostas Georgakis]], who set himself ablaze in [[Genoa]], Italy on 19 September 1970, in a protest against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].\n\n==Culture==\nCorfu has a long musical, theatrical, and operatic tradition. The operas performed in Corfu were at par with their European counterparts. The phrase \"applaudito in Corfu\" (applauded in Corfu) was a measure of high accolade for an opera performed on the island. The [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf\u00f9]] was the first theatre and [[opera]] house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]) was performed.\n\n=== Museums and libraries ===\n[[File:Gorgon at the Archaeological Museum in Corfu.jpg|thumb|The [[Gorgon]] as depicted on the western [[pediment]] from the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Temple of Artemis]], on display at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].]]\n\nThe most notable of Corfu's museums and libraries are located in the city, and are:<ref name=\"Libraries and Museums from City Hall website\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080106230632/http://www.corfu.gr/en/tourism/archives.htm Libraries and Museums from the City Hall website]</ref>\n\n* [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu|The Archaeological Museum]], inaugurated in 1967, was constructed to house the exhibit of the huge [[Gorgon]] [[pediment]] of the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis temple in the ancient city of Korkyra]], excavated at Palaiopolis in the early 20th century.

Venice honoured von der Schulenburg and the Corfiots for successfully defending the island. Recognizing St. Spyridon's role in the defence of the island Venice legislated the establishment of the litany (\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) of St Spyridon on 11 August as a commemoration of the miraculous event, inaugurating a tradition that continues to this day.<ref name=\"History of Corfu\"/> In 1716 [[Antonio Vivaldi]], on commission by the republic of Venice, composed the [[oratorio]] [[Juditha triumphans]] to commemorate this great event. ''Juditha triumphans'' was first performed in November 1716 in [[Venice]] by the orchestra and choir of the [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] and is described as Vivaldi's first great oratorio.<ref name=\"Baroque music\">[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html Baroque Music] ''As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 perform his first great oratorio, Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric {{sic}}. This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians (the Christians) over the Turks (the barbarians) in August 1716.''</ref>\nHence Spyridon is a very popular first name for Greek males born on the island and/or to islanders.\n\n===Music===\n\n====Musical history====\n[[File:Manzaro.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], major representative of the [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian School of music]]]]\n\nWhile much of present-day Greece was under Ottoman rule, the Ionian Islands enjoyed a Golden Age in music and opera. Corfu was the capital city of a Venetian protectorate and it benefited from a unique musical and theatrical heritage. Then in the 19th century, as a [[Protectorate|British Protectorate]], Corfu developed a musical heritage of its own and which constitutes the nucleus of modern Greek musical history. Until the early 18th century, musical life took place in city and village squares, with performances of straight or musical comedies \u2013 known as Momaries or Bobaries. From 1720, Corfu became the possessor of the first theatre in post-1452 Greece. It was the Teatro San Giacomo (now the City Hall) named after the nearby Roman Catholic cathedral (completed in 1691).<ref>Corfu the Garden Isle, editor Frank Giles, John Murray 1994, {{ISBN|0-7195-5375-X}}</ref>\n\nThe island was also the center of the [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian School of music]], the musical production of a group of Heptanesian composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. It was the first school of classical music in Greece and it was a heavy influence for the later Greek music scene, after the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]].\n\n====The three Philharmonics====\n[[File:Corfu Marching Band.JPG|thumb|A marching band from [[Austria]], a frequent visitor, through the Corfu landmark of {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}}.

There are nineteen such marching wind bands throughout the island. <br />Corfu city is home to the three most prestigious bands \u2013 in order of seniority:\n* the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]] use dark blue uniforms with dark red accents, and blue and red helmet plumes. It is usually called the ''Old Philharmonic'' or simply the ''Pali\u00e1'' (\"Old\"). Founded 12 September 1840.\n* the [[Nikolaos Mantzaros|Mantzaros]] Philharmonic Society use blue uniforms with blue and white helmet plumes. It is commonly called the ''N\u00e9a'' (\"New\"). Founded 25 October 1890.\n* the [[John Capodistria|Capodistria]] Philharmonic Union use bright red and black uniforms and plumes. It is commonly called the ''C\u00f3nte Capod\u00edstria'' or simply the ''C\u00f3nte'' (\"[[Count]]\"). It is the juniormost of the three (founded 18 April 1980).\nAll three maintain two major bands each, the main marching bands that can field up to 200 musicians on grand occasions, and the 60-strong student ''bandinas'' meant for lighter fare and on-the-job training.\n\nThe bands give regular summer weekend promenade concerts at the Spianada Green [[gazebo|\"''p\u00e1lko''\"]], and have a prominent part in the yearly Holy Week ceremonies.\n\n====Ionian University music department====\n[[File:Ionian University Music Laboratory.jpg|thumb|The music lab of the Ionian university located at the old fortress]]\nSince the early 1990s a music department has been established at the [[Ionian University]].

The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.\n\nThe litany is followed by the celebration of the \"Early Resurrection\"; balconies in the old city are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the ''b\u00f3tides'', \u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of {{Interlanguage link multi|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|it|3=Liston}} and in an organised fashion.<ref name=\"Easter\"/> This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night,<ref name=\"Easter\"/> and to commemorate [[King David]]'s phrase: \"Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel\" ([[Psalm 2]]:9).\n\nOnce the ''b\u00f3tides'' commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous \"''Graiko\u00ed''\" festive march.<ref name=\"Band rivalry\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE1yagErUbQ As the Old Philharmonic concludes its marching in front of their building with a hearty rendition of the ''Graiko\u00ed'' March, the New Philharmonic appears and \"salutes\" their rivals with yet another rendition of the same march]</ref> This legendary march, the anthem of the island, was composed during Venetian rule, and its lyrics urged: \"Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free\". The Venetians were replaced by the French and the French by the British, and both the lyrics and the performance of the march were officially banned.

But her mother, Augusta, is determined to force Matilde to marry a rich man in order to save the family from bankruptcy. Manuel Fuentes Guerra is the perfect candidate. He is an honorable and handsome young man who has just inherited a vast fortune. Augusta ignores the fact that Manuel is the illegitimate son of Joaqu\u00edn Fuentes Guerra, a powerful landlord who raped a native girl, and who only recognized Manuel as his heir on his deathbed.\n\nUsing all kinds of intrigues, the Augusta and her son Humberto send Adolfo to prison and convince Matilde to believe that he is married and has children. Overwhelmed and in despair, Matilde surrenders to her mother's pressure and agrees to marry Manuel, especially after she learns that he has paid the family's debts. Adolfo escapes from jail and immediately goes to look for his beloved Matilde, who has just married Manuel. Desperate, Adolfo manages to secretly speak with Matilde to clarify the misunderstandings. Swearing they will love each other forever, they decide to run away, but Manuel discovers them. Deeply hurt, Manuel is not willing to give her up. He forces her to leave with him, despite her love for Adolfo. After arriving at Manuel's [[hacienda]], Matilde has to put up with Antonia, the former administrator's daughter, who is in love with Manuel.\n\nMeanwhile, Adolfo, after an intense and frantic search finds Matilde and, intending to bring her back, poses as Manuel's new administrator. Manuel, unaware of Adolfo's real identity, sympathizes with him and gives him a special, friendly treatment. In spite of the situation, Adolfo has to admit that Manuel is a noble, fair man. At that point, Manuel and Matilde discover that they have been victims of Augusta and Humberto's deceit. As time goes by, the subtle attention and Manuel's avid desire end up conquering Matilde's heart. Suddenly one day, she realizes that the love she felt for Adolfo has disappeared and that she fell in love with Manuel. Matilde tells Adolfo the truth and urges him to leave. \n\nHeartbroken, Adolfo accepts his reality and leaves the ranch the same day Matilde announces to her husband that she's pregnant. The couple's happiness does not last long. Manuel discovers who his new administrator was and, in an instant, everything falls apart. Matilde's pleas and explanations cannot convince Manuel, he feels betrayed once again and cannot forgive her. Driven by anger, Manuel doubts his paternity and throws Matilde out of the hacienda. Soon after that, he starts a compromising relationship with Antonia that will later make his reconciliation with Matilde more difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20120716/1-recupera-misterio-venganza-pasion-amor-real/545694.shtml|title=La 1 recupera el misterio, la venganza y la pasi\u00f3n con 'Amor Real'|language=Spanish|work=[[RTVE]]|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-07-22}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Amor real characters}}\n* [[Adela Noriega]] as Matilde Pe\u00f1alver y Berist\u00e1in de Fuentes Guerra \n* [[Fernando Colunga]] as Manuel Fuentes Guerra\n* [[Mauricio Islas]] as Adolfo Sol\u00eds / Felipe Santamar\u00eda\n* [[Helena Rojo]] as Augusta Curiel de Pe\u00f1alver y Berist\u00e1in\n* [[Ernesto Laguardia]] as Humberto Pe\u00f1alver y Berist\u00e1in\n* [[Ana Mart\u00edn]] as Rosario Aranda\n* [[Chantal Andere]] as Antonia Morales\n* [[Mariana Levy]] as Josefina de Icaza\n* [[Ana Bertha Esp\u00edn]] as Prudencia Curiel\n* [[Beatriz Sheridan]] as Damiana\n* [[Mario Iv\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez]] as Renato Piquet\n* [[Mauricio Herrera]] as Urbano de las Casas\n* [[Oscar Bonfiglio (actor)|Oscar Bonfiglio]] as Sixto Valdez\n* [[Adalberto Parra]] as Delfino P\u00e9rez\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Saez (actor)|H\u00e9ctor Saez]] as Silvano Arzola\n* [[Kika Edgar]] as Catalina Heredia de Sol\u00eds\n* [[Ingrid Martz]] as Pilar Piquet de M\u00e1rquez\n\n== Production ==\n{{Quote box|width=25em|quote=\"The work of our extremely dedicated cast and crew, along with the extraordinary collection of visual elements \u2014 lighting, camera work, custom-made wardrobe, attention to detail \u2014 allows the viewers to experience the characters' emotions and also transport themselves completely to another era.\"|align=right|source=Carla Estrada<ref name=\"amorreal\"/>}}\n\n*''Amor Real'' is an adaptation of the telenovela, ''[[Bodas de odio]]'', from 1983, based on the novel of the same name, written by [[Caridad Bravo Adams]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanchez|first=Claudia|url=http://celebra.aollatino.com/2010/09/15/telenovelas-literatura-herencia-hispana/|title=Telenovelas basadas en la literatura|publisher=[[AOL|Aol Latino]]|date=2010-09-15|accessdate=June 26, 2013|language= Spanish}}</ref>  For this version it was adapted by the Italian writer, Mar\u00eda Zarattini.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Salgado \n |first=Ivett \n |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/8925418\n |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629091912/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/8925418\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=2013-06-29\n |title=Antepone Mar\u00eda Zarattini la originalidad en sus historias \n |work=[[Milenio]] \n |date=2011-03-12\n |accessdate=June 26, 2013 \n |language=Spanish \n}}</ref>\n*The telenovela was filmed at the ex-[[hacienda]] of Tetlapayac and the surrounding area in the state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] for a lapse of eight months.

But her mother, Augusta, is determined to force Matilde to marry a rich man in order to save the family from bankruptcy. Manuel Fuentes Guerra is the perfect candidate. He is an honorable and handsome young man who has just inherited a vast fortune. Augusta ignores the fact that Manuel is the illegitimate son of Joaqu\u00edn Fuentes Guerra, a powerful landlord who raped a native girl, and who only recognized Manuel as his heir on his deathbed.\n\nUsing all kinds of intrigues, the Augusta and her son Humberto send Adolfo to prison and convince Matilde to believe that he is married and has children. Overwhelmed and in despair, Matilde surrenders to her mother's pressure and agrees to marry Manuel, especially after she learns that he has paid the family's debts. Adolfo escapes from jail and immediately goes to look for his beloved Matilde, who has just married Manuel. Desperate, Adolfo manages to secretly speak with Matilde to clarify the misunderstandings. Swearing they will love each other forever, they decide to run away, but Manuel discovers them. Deeply hurt, Manuel is not willing to give her up. He forces her to leave with him, despite her love for Adolfo. After arriving at Manuel's [[hacienda]], Matilde has to put up with Antonia, the former administrator's daughter, who is in love with Manuel.\n\nMeanwhile, Adolfo, after an intense and frantic search finds Matilde and, intending to bring her back, poses as Manuel's new administrator. Manuel, unaware of Adolfo's real identity, sympathizes with him and gives him a special, friendly treatment. In spite of the situation, Adolfo has to admit that Manuel is a noble, fair man. At that point, Manuel and Matilde discover that they have been victims of Augusta and Humberto's deceit. As time goes by, the subtle attention and Manuel's avid desire end up conquering Matilde's heart. Suddenly one day, she realizes that the love she felt for Adolfo has disappeared and that she fell in love with Manuel. Matilde tells Adolfo the truth and urges him to leave. \n\nHeartbroken, Adolfo accepts his reality and leaves the ranch the same day Matilde announces to her husband that she's pregnant. The couple's happiness does not last long. Manuel discovers who his new administrator was and, in an instant, everything falls apart. Matilde's pleas and explanations cannot convince Manuel, he feels betrayed once again and cannot forgive her. Driven by anger, Manuel doubts his paternity and throws Matilde out of the hacienda. Soon after that, he starts a compromising relationship with Antonia that will later make his reconciliation with Matilde more difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20120716/1-recupera-misterio-venganza-pasion-amor-real/545694.shtml|title=La 1 recupera el misterio, la venganza y la pasi\u00f3n con 'Amor Real'|language=Spanish|work=[[RTVE]]|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-07-22}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Amor real characters}}\n* [[Adela Noriega]] as Matilde Pe\u00f1alver y Berist\u00e1in de Fuentes Guerra \n* [[Fernando Colunga]] as Manuel Fuentes Guerra\n* [[Mauricio Islas]] as Adolfo Sol\u00eds / Felipe Santamar\u00eda\n* [[Helena Rojo]] as Augusta Curiel de Pe\u00f1alver y Berist\u00e1in\n* [[Ernesto Laguardia]] as Humberto Pe\u00f1alver y Berist\u00e1in\n* [[Ana Mart\u00edn]] as Rosario Aranda\n* [[Chantal Andere]] as Antonia Morales\n* [[Mariana Levy]] as Josefina de Icaza\n* [[Ana Bertha Esp\u00edn]] as Prudencia Curiel\n* [[Beatriz Sheridan]] as Damiana\n* [[Mario Iv\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez]] as Renato Piquet\n* [[Mauricio Herrera]] as Urbano de las Casas\n* [[Oscar Bonfiglio (actor)|Oscar Bonfiglio]] as Sixto Valdez\n* [[Adalberto Parra]] as Delfino P\u00e9rez\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Saez (actor)|H\u00e9ctor Saez]] as Silvano Arzola\n* [[Kika Edgar]] as Catalina Heredia de Sol\u00eds\n* [[Ingrid Martz]] as Pilar Piquet de M\u00e1rquez\n\n== Production ==\n{{Quote box|width=25em|quote=\"The work of our extremely dedicated cast and crew, along with the extraordinary collection of visual elements \u2014 lighting, camera work, custom-made wardrobe, attention to detail \u2014 allows the viewers to experience the characters' emotions and also transport themselves completely to another era.\"|align=right|source=Carla Estrada<ref name=\"amorreal\"/>}}\n\n*''Amor Real'' is an adaptation of the telenovela, ''[[Bodas de odio]]'', from 1983, based on the novel of the same name, written by [[Caridad Bravo Adams]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanchez|first=Claudia|url=http://celebra.aollatino.com/2010/09/15/telenovelas-literatura-herencia-hispana/|title=Telenovelas basadas en la literatura|publisher=[[AOL|Aol Latino]]|date=2010-09-15|accessdate=June 26, 2013|language= Spanish}}</ref>  For this version it was adapted by the Italian writer, Mar\u00eda Zarattini.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Salgado \n |first=Ivett \n |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/8925418\n |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629091912/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/impreso/8925418\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=2013-06-29\n |title=Antepone Mar\u00eda Zarattini la originalidad en sus historias \n |work=[[Milenio]] \n |date=2011-03-12\n |accessdate=June 26, 2013 \n |language=Spanish \n}}</ref>\n*The telenovela was filmed at the ex-[[hacienda]] of Tetlapayac and the surrounding area in the state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] for a lapse of eight months.

Other European countries (including Ireland) continued to use Band III for analogue [[576i|625-line]] colour television.\n\nDigital television in the [[DVB-T]] standard can be used in conjunction with VHF Band III and is used as such in some places. The use of sub-band 2 and sub-band 3 band for [[Digital audio broadcasting|Digital Audio Broadcasting]] is now being widely adopted. Sub-band 1 is used for MPT-1327 trunked PMR radio, remote wireless microphones and PMSE links.\n\n===North America===\nIn North America, use of the band for television broadcasts is still widespread. Favorable propagation characteristics and reasonable power limits (up to 65&nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]] for [[list of North American broadcast station classes|full-power]] [[digital television]], versus 20&nbsp;kW or less on [[VHF]] [[Band I]]) has meant that many US broadcasters elected to move their full-power [[ATSC]] stations from [[UHF]] frequencies to Band III [[VHF]] when all full-power [[NTSC]] [[analog television]] services in the US shut down in 2009.<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?state=&call=&arn=&city=&chan=&cha2=13&serv=DT&type=4&facid=&list=1&dist=&dlat2=&mlat2=&slat2=&dlon2=&mlon2=&slon2=&size=9 FCC TV Query: US DTV construction permit listings for VHF Band I (ch 2-6) and III (ch 7-13)]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{TVRband}}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:Broadcast engineering]]\n[[Category:Radio spectrum]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c5a:657f:ea07:957d:52c4:22d7:b93f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eNorth America)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_III"}

The most popular catch is cultivated carp, followed by smelt and goby. Another cultivated treasure from Lake Kasumigaura is the beautiful Kasumi freshwater [[pearl]]s. They were known for their high luster and rosy hues, which is the result of a four-year cultivation period. However, in 2006, cultivation was discontinued as cheap freshwater pearls from China proved too difficult to compete against.\n\nThe water from Lake Kasumigaura has long been used for the irrigation of [[paddy field]]s in the surrounding [[alluvial plain]] and upland fields on [[diluvium|diluvial terraces]] covered by thick deposits of [[volcanic ash]]. The primary crops are [[rice]] and [[lotus root]] (a local speciality). Other crops include [[tomato]], [[cucumber]], [[eggplant]], [[watermelon]], [[maize|corn]], [[edamame]], [[sweet potato]], [[kabocha]], [[daikon]] and [[peanut]].\n\nMany tourists come to the lake in the summer to view the \u2019\u2019hobikibune\u2019\u2019 (\u5e06\u5f15\u304d\u8239) [[sail]]ed [[fishing boat]]s which are unique to Lake Kasumigaura.

The [[windmill]] of Kasumigaura comprehensive park is a popular site along the shores throughout the year and especially in the spring when the [[tulip]]s are flowering.\n\nThe lake is a recreation hotspot. [[Sport fishing]] enthusiasts and [[angling|anglers]] can be found close to shore and around the river mouths surrounding the lake. [[Recreational boat]]s, such as [[yachts]], [[power boat]]s, [[sail boat]]s and [[personal watercraft]], are regularly enjoyed on warm weekends. The wide surrounding [[wetland]]s are wonderful for [[birdwatching]], as large numbers of [[water fowl]] can be observed, primarily during the wintering period.

At one time it was also known as \"Kalimati\" (meaning \"Land of Black soil\") after the village near the Sakchi area. Sakchi was renamed to Jamshedpur in 1919.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dutta|first=Maya|title=Jamshedpur: the growth of the city and its regions|year=1977|publisher=Asiatic Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ecJOAQAAIAAJ&q=jamshedpur&dq=jamshedpur}}</ref> The only trace of the name is the main road through Sakchi area of Jamshedpur which is named Kalimati Road.\n\n==History==\nAt the end of the 19th century, Jamsetji Tata met steelmakers in [[Pittsburgh]] to get the most advanced technology for his plant. It is said that he got the idea of building a steel plant when he heard [[Thomas Carlyle]] declaring that \"the nation which gains control of iron soon acquires the control of gold\" in a lecture in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/heritage/landmark.asp|title=Page Not Found|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> At the turn of the twentieth century, Jamshetji Tata asked geologist Charles Page Perin to help him find the site to build India's first steel plant. The search for a site rich in iron, coal, limestone and water began in April 1904 in today's [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Then Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]] appointed in his court renowned geologist Shri [[Pramatha Nath Bose]], who had been instrumental in setting up of the steel plant at Sakchi. Bose, on the request of the Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]], surveyed the Gorumahisani hills of Babanghati region of then Mayurbhanja state, and found Hematite deposit there. P. N. Bose insisted Jamsetji Tata choose Sakchi for his dream plant.\n\nThe prospectors C. M. Weld, [[Dorabji Tata]] and [[Shapurji Saklatvala]] took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]], near the confluence of the [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]] and [[Kharkai River|Kharkai]] rivers. It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected.<ref name=\"Httpwwwtatasteelcomheritagehistoryhistoryasp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatasteel100.com/heritage/history/history04.asp |title=Sakchi- an end to the search of Iron-ore in Steel making process |publisher=Tatasteel100.com |date=27 February 1908 |accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908 the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began.<ref name=\"Httpwwwtatasteelcomheritagehistoryhistoryasp\" /> The first steel ingot was rolled on 16 February 1912.

He envisioned far more than a mere row of workers' hutments. He insisted upon building all the comforts and conveniences a city could provide. As a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the Jubilee Park. While building the city, Jamsetji Tata had said, \"Be sure to lay wide streets planted with shady trees, every other of a quick-growing variety. Be sure that there is plenty of space for lawns and gardens; reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks; earmark areas for [[Hindu]] temples, Muslim mosques and Christian churches.\"\n\nMessrs Julin Kennedy Sahlin from Pittsburgh prepared the first layout of the town of Jamshedpur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tripsguru.com/places/Jamshedpur/moredetails.html |title=Jamshedpur \u2013 More details \u2013 Tourist Destinations in India \u2013 Lakes, Waterfalls, Beaches, Monuments, Museums and parks at Jamshedpur- By |publisher=Tripsguru.com |accessdate=13 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194951/http://tripsguru.com/places/Jamshedpur/moredetails.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}</ref> What the city looks like today is a testament to their visionary plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_t/tata_steel/20070131_hundred_years.htm |title=A hundred years of Tata steel |publisher=domain-b.com |accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation.\n\nLegend has it that in the late 1980s when the state government proposed a law to end the Tatas' administration of Jamshedpur and bring the city under a municipality, the local populace rose in protest and defeated the government's proposal. In 2005, a similar proposal was once again put up by lobbying politicians. The target audience was the working class. A large majority sided with the government and set up protest meetings outside the East-Singhbhum Deputy Commissioner's office. However, the objective was never achieved and Jamshedpur remains without a municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/jamshedpur-citizens-do-not-want-municipal-corporation/64894/ |title=Jamshedpur citizens do not want municipal corporation |publisher=Financialexpress.com |date=16 January 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030613/asp/jamshedpur/story_2064297.asp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Push to civic makeover | date=13 June 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.ibnlive.com/news/jamshedpur-on-a-renewal-mission/20820-7.html |title=Jamshedpur on a renewal mission \u2013 Business News \u2013 IBNLive |publisher=Origin-www.ibnlive.com |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=13 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530052855/http://origin-www.ibnlive.com/news/jamshedpur-on-a-renewal-mission/20820-7.html |archive-date=30 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:City of Jamshedpur.jpg|left|thumb|City of Jamshedpur]]\n[[File:African lions in Tata Steel Zoological Park.jpg|150px|thumb|[[African lions]] at [[Tata Steel Zoological Park]]]]\nJamshedpur is situated in the southern end of the state of [[Jharkhand]] and is bordered by the states of Odisha and West Bengal.

It will be built on the site of an abandoned World War II airfield situated 60 kilometres from Jamshedpur on NH-33.\nThe old airfield was built around 1942, as an ancillary runway for other airfields in the vicinity that were being built around India's eastern frontier as part of the war effort. It was one of the airfields used by Allied forces to repel the advancing Japanese troops and to maintain transport links with China. As the Japanese forces came to control shipping in the China Sea, seaborne supply routes to China were cut and the difficult, 500&nbsp;km route over the Himalayas was increasingly used. The airfield was abandoned after the war.\n\nThe technical team of the [[Airports Authority of India]] (AAI) conducted survey in 2017 and approved the [[Dhalbhumgarh]] site for a greenfield airport. The government plans to invest Rs 300 crore through AAI for the new airport which will have a 3 kilometre long runway. In January 2018, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha announced that the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and the Jharkhand Government would sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the construction of [[Dhalbhumgarh Airport]].\n\n==Education and research==\n{{see also|List of educational institutes in Jamshedpur}}\n\nImportant educational institutions in Jamshedpur are: [[XLRI]], founded in 1949; [[Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Jamshedpur|Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College]], established in 1961; and the engineering college [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], an [[Institute of National Importance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tatagrowthshop.com/sustainability/jamshedpur-glance.htm |title=Jamshedpur at a Glance |website=Tata Steel Growth Shop |accessdate=3 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aiada.in/web/advantage/training-facility.php |title=Training Facility |website=Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority |accessdate=3 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Metallurgical Laboratory]] (NML), one of the 38 [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) laboratories, was inaugurated on 26 November 1950 by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmlindia.org/60years.html |title=60 Years of Dedication to the Future |website=National Metallurgical Laboratory |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nShavak Nanavati Technical Institute (SNTI), established in 1921 as the technical training department of Tata Steel, now develops skilled employees for other companies as well.

The city is located in nature's den in [[Chota Nagpur Plateau|Chota Nagpur plateau]], surrounded by the picturesque [[Dalma Hills]] and bordered by the rivers [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]] and [[Kharkai River|Kharkai]].\n\n==Etymology==\nIn 1919 [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] named the city, which was earlier a village called [[Sakchi]], to Jamshedpur in honour of its founder, [[Jamsetji Tata|Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata]], whose birthday is celebrated on 3 March as Founder's Day.<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/tata-steel-to-host-179th-founders-day-celebration/articleshow/63094371.cms</ref> J.

At one time it was also known as \"Kalimati\" (meaning \"Land of Black soil\") after the village near the Sakchi area. Sakchi was renamed to Jamshedpur in 1919.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dutta|first=Maya|title=Jamshedpur: the growth of the city and its regions|year=1977|publisher=Asiatic Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ecJOAQAAIAAJ&q=jamshedpur&dq=jamshedpur}}</ref> The only trace of the name is the main road through Sakchi area of Jamshedpur which is named Kalimati Road.\n\n==History==\nAt the end of the 19th century, Jamsetji Tata met steelmakers in [[Pittsburgh]] to get the most advanced technology for his plant. It is said that he got the idea of building a steel plant when he heard [[Thomas Carlyle]] declaring that \"the nation which gains control of iron soon acquires the control of gold\" in a lecture in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/heritage/landmark.asp|title=Page Not Found|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> At the turn of the twentieth century, Jamshetji Tata asked geologist Charles Page Perin to help him find the site to build India's first steel plant. The search for a site rich in iron, coal, limestone and water began in April 1904 in today's [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Then Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]] appointed in his court renowned geologist Shri [[Pramatha Nath Bose]], who had been instrumental in setting up of the steel plant at Sakchi. Bose, on the request of the Maharaja of [[Mayurbhanj]], surveyed the Gorumahisani hills of Babanghati region of then Mayurbhanja state, and found Hematite deposit there. P. N. Bose insisted Jamsetji Tata choose Sakchi for his dream plant.\n\nThe prospectors C. M. Weld, [[Dorabji Tata]] and [[Shapurji Saklatvala]] took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the [[Chota Nagpur plateau]], near the confluence of the [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]] and [[Kharkai River|Kharkai]] rivers. It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected.<ref name=\"Httpwwwtatasteelcomheritagehistoryhistoryasp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatasteel100.com/heritage/history/history04.asp |title=Sakchi- an end to the search of Iron-ore in Steel making process |publisher=Tatasteel100.com |date=27 February 1908 |accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908 the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began.<ref name=\"Httpwwwtatasteelcomheritagehistoryhistoryasp\" /> The first steel ingot was rolled on 16 February 1912.

He envisioned far more than a mere row of workers' hutments. He insisted upon building all the comforts and conveniences a city could provide. As a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the Jubilee Park. While building the city, Jamsetji Tata had said, \"Be sure to lay wide streets planted with shady trees, every other of a quick-growing variety. Be sure that there is plenty of space for lawns and gardens; reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks; earmark areas for [[Hindu]] temples, Muslim mosques and Christian churches.\"\n\nMessrs Julin Kennedy Sahlin from Pittsburgh prepared the first layout of the town of Jamshedpur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tripsguru.com/places/Jamshedpur/moredetails.html |title=Jamshedpur \u2013 More details \u2013 Tourist Destinations in India \u2013 Lakes, Waterfalls, Beaches, Monuments, Museums and parks at Jamshedpur- By |publisher=Tripsguru.com |accessdate=13 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194951/http://tripsguru.com/places/Jamshedpur/moredetails.html |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}</ref> What the city looks like today is a testament to their visionary plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domain-b.com/companies/companies_t/tata_steel/20070131_hundred_years.htm |title=A hundred years of Tata steel |publisher=domain-b.com |accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation.\n\nLegend has it that in the late 1980s when the state government proposed a law to end the Tatas' administration of Jamshedpur and bring the city under a municipality, the local populace rose in protest and defeated the government's proposal. In 2005, a similar proposal was once again put up by lobbying politicians. The target audience was the working class. A large majority sided with the government and set up protest meetings outside the East-Singhbhum Deputy Commissioner's office.

It will be built on the site of an abandoned World War II airfield situated 60 kilometres from Jamshedpur on NH-33.\nThe old airfield was built around 1942, as an ancillary runway for other airfields in the vicinity that were being built around India's eastern frontier as part of the war effort. It was one of the airfields used by Allied forces to repel the advancing Japanese troops and to maintain transport links with China. As the Japanese forces came to control shipping in the China Sea, seaborne supply routes to China were cut and the difficult, 500&nbsp;km route over the Himalayas was increasingly used. The airfield was abandoned after the war.\n\nThe technical team of the [[Airports Authority of India]] (AAI) conducted survey in 2017 and approved the [[Dhalbhumgarh]] site for a greenfield airport. The government plans to invest Rs 300 crore through AAI for the new airport which will have a 3 kilometre long runway.

This is taken from children's classic Bengali folk-lore collection ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' (1907) by [[Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder]]]]\nGhosts are an important part of [[folklore]], and form an integral part of the socio-cultural beliefs of the people living in the geographical and ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]], which today consists of the independent nation of [[Bangladesh]], and the Indian states of [[West Bengal]]. [[Fairy tales]], both old and new, often use the concept of [[ghost]]s. In modern-day [[Bengali literature]], cinema and also in radio & television media, the references to ghosts are often found. There are also many alleged haunted sites in this region.  It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth. The common word for ghosts in Bengali is ''[[Bhoot (ghost)|bhoot]]'' or ''bhut'' ({{lang-bn|\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4}}). This word has an alternative meaning: 'past' in Bengali. Also, the word ''[[Preta|Pret]]'' (derived from Sanskrit 'Preta') is used in Bengali to mean ghost. In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident). Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death.\n\nThe Bengali Hindu community celebrates ''Bhoot Chaturdashi'', which normally occurs on the 14th day of ''Krishna Paksha'' (waning phase of moon) at the night before ''[[Kali Puja]]'' / ''Dipaboli'' festival. On this night, Bengalis light 14 earthen-lamps (''choddo prodip'') at their homes to appease the spirits of their past 14 generations of ancestors. It is believed that in the night before Kali Puja, the spirits of these ancestors descend upon earth, and these lamps help them find their loving homes.<ref>{{Citation|last=Indrajit Roy Choudhury|title=Bhoot Chaturdashi|url=https://indroyc.com/2015/11/09/todays-bhoot-chaturdashi/}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Festivals of India|title=Bhoot Chaturdashi 2016- The Indian Halloween Night|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Bhoot-Chaturdashi/}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Rohini Chatterji|title=Kosha mangsho and Bhoot Chaturdashi: Celebrating Kali Puja and Diwali, Bengali style|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/kosha-mangsho-and-bhoot-chaturdashi-celebrating-kali-puja-and-diwali-bengali-style-1762781.html}}</ref> Another popular belief is that [[Chamunda]] (a fearsome aspect of [[Kali]]) along with 14 other ghostly forms ward off the evil spirits from the house as 14 earthen-lamps are lit at different entrances and dark corners of the rooms. Also, it is customary to consume a dish of 14 types of leafy vegetable (''choddo shaak'') during ''Bhoot Chaturdashi'', so that evil spirits cannot possess the body.<ref>{{Citation|last=Anirban Saha|title=Bhoot Chaturdoshi, what's that?t|url=http://www.anirbansaha.com/bhoot-chaturdoshi/}}</ref>\n\n==Types of ghosts and other supernatural entities ==\n{{in-universe|section|date=May 2019}}\n{{more footnotes|section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThere are many kinds of ghosts and similar supernatural entities that frequently come up in [[Bengali culture]], its folklores and form an important part in Bengali peoples' socio-cultural beliefs and superstitions.

The word ''Petni'' originated from the Sanskrit word ''Pretni'' (feminine gender of ''[[Preta]]''). The word ''Shakchunni'' comes from the Sanskrit word ''Shankhachurni''. It is a ghost of a married woman who usually wears a special kind of traditional bangles made of shell (called \u2018Shankha\u2019 in Bengali) in their hands, which is a sign of married woman in Bengal.\n[[File:Depiction of a Shakchunni spreading cow dung mixed water.jpg|250px|thumb|Depiction of a ''Shakchunni'' spreading cow dung mixed with water]]\n* '''Damori''': [[Tantra|Tantric]] practices and black magic have been very popular in rural Bengal in the past for many centuries. Some rural people from Bengal, obsessed with the occult, used to travel to [[Kamakhya Temple|Kamrup-Kamakhya]] in [[Assam]] in order to learn Tantric ways and black magic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/news/kamakhya-the-seat-of-black-magic-imagegallery-national-jgxm3ngbecdsi.html|title=Kamakhya: The seat of black magic|website=Sify|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kamakhyabhaktlalbaba.wordpress.com/about-kamakhya-temple/|title=About Kamakhya Temple|website=Lal Baba- The Spiritual Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> Many ''Sadhu'' (Ascetic Yogis), ''Tantric'', ''[[Aghori]]'', ''[[Kapalika|Kapalik]]'' and ''[[Kabiraj]]'' devoted their lives in pursuit of occult practices. Such people are said to have the power to invoke lower-level demonic/ ghostly entities such as ''Hakini, Shakhini'' (same as ''Shakchunni'') and ''Dakini''. Tantriks use these demonic spirits for soothsaying purposes, and also for causing harm to people. When superstitious rural people wanted to cause harm to an enemy, they went to the Tantriks to seek their help. A common practice was called \"Baan Mara\", a ritual by which the Tantriks used demonic forces to kill a person. In such cases, the victim is said to die by vomiting blood up their throat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/indian-gods-and-goddesses-yogini-shrines-and-saktipithas-set-of-2-volumes-NAL248/|title=Yogini Shrines and Saktipithas (Set of 2 Volumes)|website=Exotic India|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/damara-tantra-IDI630/|title=Damara Tantra|website=Exotic India|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> The two most higher-level tantric mantra are ''Kularnob'' and ''Moha Damor''. A tantrik mantra called ''Bhoot Damor'' (a lower-level branch of ''Moha Damor'') works with different demi-goddesses called ''[[Yogini|Jogini]]'', ''Jokkhini'', ''Kinnori'', ''Apshori'', ''Bhutini'', etc.<ref>{{Citation|last=\u09b6\u09cd\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0\u09b8\u09bf\u0995\u09ae\u09cb\u09b9\u09a8 \u099a\u099f\u09cd\u099f\u09cb\u09aa\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09af\u09bc|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/bhoot-damar-tantra-NZH161/|title= \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4\u09a1\u09be\u09ae\u09b0\u09a4\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}}</ref> Altogether these bunch of supernatural entities are called ''Damori''. In Tantrik philosophy, it is believed If someone can engulf himself into ascetic pursuit and worship through ''Bhoot Damor'', the invoked Damori will appear to that person, will associate with him, and becomes somewhat under his control.  These beings are neither human nor incorporeal, but somewhere in-between. They are from some unseen realm, and can materialise in our perceived physical dimension. Their concept is similar to the western concept of ''[[Fairies]]'' or ''[[Elf|Elves]]''; or the Islamic/Persian concept of ''Pori'' / ''Pari''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/bhuta-damara-tantra-authoritative-tantra-of-sri-krodha-bhairava-along-with-his-mantras-mandal-worship-rituals-and-accomplishment-rituals-of-bhutinis-yakshinis-snake-girls-etc-NAK836/|title=Bhuta Damara Tantra (An  Authoritative Tantra of Sri Krodha Bhairava Along with His Mantras, Mandal Worship Rituals and Accomplishment Rituals of Bhutinis, Yakshinis, Snake-Girls etc.)|website=Exotic India|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/cult-of-occult-science-mantra-tantra-yantra-tone-totke-and-keelam-method-NAK624/|title=Cult of Occult Science: Mantra-Tantra-Yantra (Tone Totke and Keelam Method)|website=Exotic India|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n* '''Besho Bhoot''': The word ''Besho'' comes from the word ''Baash'' which means 'Bamboo' in Bengali. Besho Bhoot are ghosts that live in bamboo gardens. People from rural Bengal believe that harmful ghosts live in bamboo gardens, and one should not walk pass these areas after dusk. It is said that when a bamboo leans or lays in the ground, no one should cross over it and should go around it. This is because when someone makes an attempt to cross the bamboo, the bamboo is pulled back straight up by an unseen force, and the person can die as a result. It is also reported that a gusty wind blows inside the bamboo garden while the weather is calm on the outside.<ref>{{Citation|last=Abdul Gaffar Ronnie|title=\u09ac\u09be\u0981\u09b6\u09ac\u09be\u0997\u09be\u09a8\u09c7 \u0995\u09bf \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09c7?|url=http://www.banglamail24.com/news/147631|access-date=19 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427153251/http://www.banglamail24.com/news/147631|archive-date=27 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://story.shishukishor.org/2016/02/blog-post_14.html?m=1|title=\u09ac\u09c7\u0981\u09b6\u09cb \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 - \u09a8\u099c\u09b0\u09c1\u09b2 \u0987\u09b8\u09b2\u09be\u09ae|last=shishu kishor (Bengali)|website=story.shishukishor.org|access-date=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n* '''Penchapechi''': An unusual form of ghost. The ''Penchapechi'' take the form of an owl and haunt in the forests of Bengal. It follows helpless travelers through the woods until they are completely alone, and then it strikes. Unlike other ghosts, the Penchapechi actually consumes its victims, feeding on their body in an almost vampiric way.\n* '''Mechho Bhoot''': This is a kind of ghost who likes to eat fish. The word ''Mechho'' comes from ''Machh'' that means 'fish' in Bengali. Mechho Bhoot usually lives near to the village ponds or lakes which are full of fish.  These kinds of ghosts urges the late night fishermen or a lone person who carries fish with him to give them their fish by saying in a nasal tone - \"Machh Diye Ja\" (meaning \"give me the fish\"). If the person refuses to leave the fish for the Mechho Bhoot, it threatens to harm them. Sometimes they steal fish from kitchens in village households or from the boats of fishermen.\n* '''Mamdo Bhoot''': According to the beliefs of Bengali Hindu community, these are believed to be the ghosts of [[Muslims]]. Ghosts of such kind are believed to kill people by twisting their necks.\n* '''Gechho Bhoot''': It is a kind of ghost that lives in trees. The word ''Gechho'' comes from the word ''Gaachh'', which means ''tree'' in Bengali.\n* [[Aleya (Ghost light)|'''Aleya]] / '''Atoshi Bhoot''': Atoshi (or marsh ghost-light) is the name given to an unexplained strange light phenomena occurring over the marshes as observed by Bengalis, especially the fishermen of West Bengal and Bangladesh. This marsh light ([[Will-o'-the-wisp]]) often look like a flying, glowing orb of fire. These confuse the fishermen, and is said to lure them out and then drown them into the very depths of water, never to rise again. Like Nishi, their voice is also said to be irresistible. Local communities in the region believe that these are the ghosts of fisherman who died fishing. The fishermen of Sundarban delta region, especially the Khasti and Manna fishermen communities, strongly believe in these and always do an'''''<nowiki/>''''' ''<nowiki/>'<nowiki/>''A'''''<nowiki/>'''''toshi-tar'''''<nowiki/>'''''on ritual before they go out for fishing. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://booksobsession.blogspot.com/2009/10/hbt-guest-post-with-author-saundra.html|title=Blog post by the author Saundra Mitchel of the novel \"Shadowed Summer\" at Books Obsession|website=Booksobsession.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Begho Bhoot''': The word ''Begho'' comes from the Bengali word ''Baagh'' meaning 'tiger'. Begho Bhoot are ghosts of the people who were killed or eaten by the tigers in [[Sundarbans]], which is known to be the [[Royal Bengal Tiger]] Sanctuary of the [[Bengal]] region. The villagers living in the area believe in these kinds of ghosts. These entities are said to frighten people who enters the jungle in search of honey or woods, and try to bring them to face tigers. Sometimes they do the mimicry of tigers to terrify the villagers.\n* '''Skondhokata / Kondhokata''': It is a headless ghost. These are believed to be the spirit of those people who died by having their heads cut-off by train accident or by some other way. This kind of ghost always searches their missing heads, and pleads others to help them to find it. Sometimes they attack the humans and make them slaves to search for their lost heads.\n* '''Kanabhulo''': This is a ghost which hypnotises a person, and takes him to some unknown location. The victim, instead of going into his destination, goes to another place which is silent and eerie. After that the victim loses his sense. These types of ghosts strike at night. Lone travellers, or a person separated from his group becomes the victim of such ghosts.\n*'''Prapti''': The word ''Prapti'' is a Sanskrit one meaning 'to get something'. These are said to be ghosts of girls who had more than one lover, and suffered from indecision. These girls therefore committed suicide, thus 'getting freedom' from all the conflict. It is said that after the girl dies, her lovers also commit suicide to be with her, or the Prapti haunts them and drives them to insanity until they do so. But the irony is that after the lovers die, they still do no get the girl, who escapes after taking her revenge. Therefore, the ghosts of the lovers get stuck forever, searching for their love.\n* '''Dainee''':  Dainee means \"[[Witch]]\". ''Dainee'' is not actually soul or spirit, rather is a  living being. Usually in villages of Bengal, old suspicious women who know mumbo-jumbo and other witchcrafts or black magic are considered as ''Dainee''. It is believed that the Dainee kidnaps children, kills them and suck their blood to survive a hundred years.\n[[File:Folk-tales of bengal, illustration by W. Goble 1912.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|A benevolent ''Brahmadaitya'' saving a poor ''[[Brahmin]]'' man from a group of ''Bhoot'' (ghosts), while the man was cutting a branch from the yonder banyan tree or [[Ficus religiosa|Ashwattha tree]]. An illustration by Warwick Goble (1912). Taken from the 1912 illustrated edition of ''Folk-Tales of Bengal'' by [[Lal Behari Dey]].]]\n* '''Brahmodaittyo''': These are one of the most popular kind of ghost in Bengal who are believed to be benevolent. It is believed to be the ghost of holy [[Brahmin]]. Usually, they appear wearing a traditional Dhoti (Bengali dress for men) and the holy thread on their body. They are very kind and helpful to human being as depicted in many Bengali stories, folk-lores and movies.\n* '''Boba''': This is the Bengali version of the \"[[Old Hag Syndrome]]\" which is believed to be caused by a supernatural entity called \"Boba\" (meaning \"dumb\"/unable to speak). Boba attacks a person by strangling him when the person sleeps in a [[Supine position]]/ sleep on back. However, the scientific explanation is believed to be [[Sleep Paralysis]]. While a person is having sleep paralysis, he hallucinates in his [[REM sleep]] while the brain is functioning but the body is asleep. This actually causes the person to completely unable to move or speak, and results in to hallucinate weird entities such as an old hag (a witch-like demonic being). In Bangladesh, the phenomenon is called \"Bobaay Dhora\" (meaning \"Struck by Boba\").<ref>{{Citation|last=health.banglablog24.com|title=\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09c7\u09b2\u09be\u09af\u09bc \u2018\u09ac\u09cb\u09ac\u09be \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09a7\u09b0\u09be\u2019 \u098f\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a4\u09bf\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\u09a8!|url=http://health.banglablog24.com/\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0-\u09ac\u09c7\u09b2\u09be\u09af\u09bc-\u09ac\u09cb\u09ac\u09be-\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4-\u09a7\u09b0\u09be/}}</ref>\n* '''Sheekol Buri / Jol-Pishach''': They are believed to dwell in the rivers, ponds, and lakes. They are called by different names in different localities of Bengal. Young women, who either committed suicide by drowning due to an unhappy marriage (they might have been jilted by their lovers or abused and harassed by their much older husbands), or who were violently drowned against their will (especially after becoming pregnant with unwanted children), must live out their designated time on earth and come back as such beings.  Her main purpose is, however, to lure young men and take them into the depths of said waterways where she would entangle their feet with her long hair and submerge them. Their hair is very long and always wet, and their eyes are without any iris. Like many fairies, they sometimes do take human lovers. Unfortunately, most of such unions end tragically for the human. As is usually the case, they extract a promise from her mortal lover and when such promise is broken, she reveals herself to be the supernatural creature she is, often taking the life of the human in the process. Their general habitat is water bodies even though they roam around the land/wilderness around the water and are also often seen sitting over trees at the dead of night. The concept of such supernatural beings is similar to that of [[Rusalka]] from Slavic mythology.\n* '''Nishi''': The Nishi (Night Spirit) lures its victim to a secluded area by calling to the person with the voice of a loved one. The Nishi only strikes at night, and once the victim responds to the call of Nishi, s/he becomes hypnotised, follow the voice, and are never seen again. So, it is unknown what happens to them. Some [[tantra|tantrics]] are said to nurture and conjure the Nishi, in order to use them to harm someone out of spite or revenge. The voice of Nishi (means 'Night') is known as \"Nishir Daak\" (Call of the Night Spirit). Bengali age old superstition suggests that [[Sleepwalking]] phenomenon is also caused by Nishi. According to folklore, the Nishi cannot call out more than twice, and so no one should answer a voice at night until being called at least three times.\n* '''Gudro Bonga''': Even though these as worshipped as demigods by the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] community (an indigenous tribe in Bengal), many Santhal families are said to nurture and look after these small dwarf-like (2\u20133 feet tall) creatures who look like small children.

They usually are short in height. It is a belief that they stay in somebody's house and they help the house-owner to make money. They are believed to bring luck. They are possibly similar to Domovoi\u2019s of Russian folklores.\n* '''[[Rakshasa|Rakkhosh]]''': A demonic fierce-looking being with pointed fangs, sharp claw-like fingernails, and superhuman strength. The stories of these creatures feature in the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. A lot of fairy-tale stories in Bengali folklore also speaks of this vicious demonic tribe which feeds on human. Bengali women traditionally put their children to sleep by narrating scary folk-tale stories of the ''Rakkhosh''. The threat punchline by a Rakkhosh in traditional Bengali folk-tales is this couplet: ''Hau, Mau, Cau,....Manusher Gondho Pau'' (meaning: \"Hau, Mau, Cau (nonsensical rhyming words),....I Smell a Human\"). Similar to \u201cfi fie foe...\u201d, the catchphrase associated with giants in some folklore.\n*'''Khokkosh''': These are dwarf-like malicious and grotesque monster, which is depicted as a smaller version of ''Rakkhosh''. The stories of ''Khokkosh'' is frequently found in traditional Bengali fairy-tales and folk-lores. \n*'''[[Daitya|Daittyo]]''': They have human appearance, but of prodigious size and extraordinary strength. Same as [[Giant (mythology)|Giants]].\n*'''[[Pishacha|Pishach]] / Adomkhor''': Pishach are flesh-eating demonic entity who mainly feed from cadavers. They like darkness and traditionally depicted to haunt cremation grounds and graveyards. They have the power to assume different forms at will, and may also become invisible. Sometimes, they possess human beings and alter their thoughts, and the victims are afflicted with a variety of maladies and abnormalities like insanity. The female version of Pishach is called \"Pishachini\", which is described to have a hideous and terrible appearance, however she sometimes appears in the devious disguise of a youthful, beautiful maiden to lure young men. She drains their blood, semen, and virility. She dwells and prowls in places associated with death and filth. They are similar to the western concept of [[ghoul]]s.\n* '''[[Vetala|Betaal]]''': Betaal are defined as spirits inhabiting cadavers and charnel grounds. These evil spirits may use corpses as vehicles for movement (as they no longer decay while so inhabited); but a Betaal may also leave the corpse at will.\n* '''[[Yaksha|Jokkho / Jokkh]]''': A supernatural warrior-type entity who are the guardians and protectors of hidden treasures/wealth on earth. They are usually considered to be benevolent, and said to bestow fertility and wealth upon their devotees. There is a commonly used Bengali idiom - ''Jokkher Dhon'' (literal meaning: Jokkho's Wealth) which actually implies \"protecting a beloved person\" or \"safeguarding precious wealth\". \n* '''[[Jinn]]''' / '''Djinn''': The [[Muslim]] community of Bengal strongly believe that any supernatural/ghostly/demonic/paranormal occurrence, phenomenon and manifestation is the work of Jinn. Jinns can be both benevolent or malevolent. Malevolent Jinns ([[Demon]]) can be really evil, and can cause haunting in human residences, empty houses, toilets, lakes, graveyards, morgues, hospitals, and in the wilderness. Some people are also believed to conjure Jinns, and use them to fulfil their evil purposes. When a Jinn is in the vicinity, a person might experience a strange perfume/flowery smell or terrible odour of rotten flesh, or burning odour even though no possible source of those smell/odour can be found. Jinns have no physical body of their own, and are creatures from an unseen dimension/realm. Jinns are shape-shifters, and often take the form of a human or animal (commonly snake, dog, cat, crow, or bull). When Jinn attaches itself to a living person, people call it jinn/demonic possession. Jinns are exorcised by pious people like [[Imam]] or [[Mawlana]] by reciting chapters from the [[Quran]]. Professional village exorcists/ witch-doctors called [[Kabiraj]] / [[Ojha]] commands/forces the Jinn to leave the possessed person by exorcism rituals which includes the use of talismans/ [[Ta'wiz]]/Tabiz, or by conjuring a good Jinn to counteract the forces of the possessing evil Jinn. Jinns have the ability to predict future, can read people's thoughts, have extraordinary strength and powers; and a person possessed by a Jinn can also demonstrate such abilities. However, Jinns are dimwitted, foolhardy, aggressive, angry and deceives humans with their lies. There are also good and wise jinns who are believed to be pious and save/help human from dangerous/ fatal situations.  Jinns are believed to eat raw fish/meat/bones and are fond of traditional Bengali sweets. The sweet salespeople in Bangladesh strongly affirm the idea that Jinns come to the sweet shops at late night in human form to buy sweets. Jinns live in clans, and every clan is headed by a King Jinn. There are several distinct classes of Jinn, such as [[Marid]], [[Ifreet]] and [[Ghul]] (Ghoul) and [[Qareen]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKL3AgAAQBAJ|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|last=Lebling|first=Robert|date=2010-07-30|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857730633|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMEipdTtH9oC|title=The Vengeful Djinn: Unveiling the Hidden Agenda of Genies|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary Ellen|last2=Imbrogno|first2=Philip J.|date=2011-07-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9780738728810|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ittefaq.com.bd/print-edition/drishtikon/2014/10/03/7337.html|title=\u099c\u09bf\u09a8 \u09ae\u09bf\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09bf \u0996\u09be\u09af\u09bc!|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The Daily Ittefaq]]|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/tmag/2014/oct/31/fear-street|title=Fear Street |work=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Alleged haunted places ==\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n[[File:Lalbagh Fort, south entrance, south view Dhaka 1875.jpg|thumbnail|Lalbagh Fort, south entrance, south view (1875)|200px]]\n\n[[Lalbagh Fort]], Golf Heights Banani, Airport Road, [[Uttara (Dhaka)|Uttara]] Sector-3 in [[Dhaka]]; [[Chalan Beel]] in [[Sirajganj]], Foy's Lake, Pakri Beach, Mirsarai Highway Crossing in [[Chittagong]] and many other places in Bangladesh is claimed to be haunted.<ref name=\"daily-sun.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/86647/HAUNTED-TALES:-IN-CONVERSATION-WITH-%E2%80%98DHAKA-PARANORMAL-SOCIETY%E2%80%99|title=HAUNTED TALES: IN CONVERSATION WITH \u2018DHAKA PARANORMAL SOCIETY\u2019|website=daily-sun.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Sami Tahsin|title=The Clandestine Adversary: Bangladeshi Hauntings 101|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-clandestine-adversary-bangladeshi-hauntings-101 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n* '''[[Lalbagh Fort|Lalbagh Fort, Dhaka]]''': Lalbagh Fort near Dhaka is one of the most haunted place in Bangladesh.

Another well-known haunting myth of Lalbagh Fort is the ghost of a man on his horse, who gets in and out of the fort at night. They say this apparition actually goes for his prayers. Normally, prayer time starts around 5 am. However, when people see this ghost, they hear the call for prayer coming from the prayer room at around 3 am, which is absurd. When they rush to see what is happening inside the prayer room, they find it completely empty. In other rumours, there is a hidden passageway to Agra (presently in India) from this fort. Local legends say, whoever found this passageway and entered it, has never returned. However, the doorways that claimed to have connected to Agra had been sealed long ago by the British rulers after a mystical occurrence happened to an investigation team. The team was searching for the end of the hidden passageway with their dogs chained by the team members. First they sent their dogs to enter the dark passage but when they pulled their chain they saw the dogs disappeared. The British rulers also sent some elephants in this tunnel, but according to legend, none of them ever returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hauntedbangla.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/haunted-locations-in-bangladesh-part-i.html|title=Haunted Bangladesh: Haunted Locations In Bangladesh Part - I|website=hauntedbangla.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Foy's Lake 2 by Rahat.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Foy's Lake, Chittagong]]\n* '''[[Foy's Lake|Foy's Lake, Chittagong]]''': The famous Foy's Lake in Chittagong is known for its long-standing reputation of being haunted.

However, at the present day, some young Bengali horror story writers are being somewhat influenced by the western horror literature, and their writings thus lack the originality of the classic Bengali horror literature and ghost stories.\n\n=== Cinema ===\nClassic Bengali films with horror/supernatural plot are only a handful. ''[[Kankal]]'' (1950),<ref>{{Citation|last=Naresh Mitra|title=Kankal Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRFuw9Z9__Y}}</ref> [[Hanabari]] (1952),<ref>{{Citation|last=Movies24|title=Hanabari 1952 Bengali Full Movie|date=2015-06-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hFOk-rZgZY|accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> ''Monihara'' of the ''[[Teen Kanya]]'' movie anthology (1961)<ref>{{Citation|last=Satyajit Ray|title=Teen Kanya Bengali Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Fc_qJQnB0}}</ref> [[Kuheli]] (1971),<ref>{{Citation|last=Anupam Das|title=kuheli full movie|date=2013-09-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeJweMZEqSA|accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> were quite popular horror/supernatural thriller flick in the era of Bengali black and white movies.\n\nIn many Bengali films, ghosts are depicted in a lightly comical mood and sometimes in a friendly way. One of the examples is ''[[Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne]]'' (1969) as mentioned earlier is adopted from the story of [[Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury]] and directed by [[Satyajit Ray]]. In this film the King of Ghosts gives three boons to 'Goopy' and 'Bagha', the two  poor village boys who aspired to become a singer and drummer respectively. With the help of those boons they did many amazing adventures. The film is the first film of the ''[[Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (series)|Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne series]]'', followed by a couple of sequels - ''[[Hirak Rajar Deshe]]'' was released in 1980; and ''[[Goopy Bagha Phire Elo]]'', written by Ray, but directed by his son [[Sandip Ray]], was released in 1992.\n\n''[[Nishi Trishna]]'' (1989), directed by Parimal Bhattacharya was the first Bengali vampire movie, starring [[Shekhar Chatterjee]], [[Prasenjit Chatterjee]] and [[Moon Moon Sen]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Bengali Movies - Angel Digital|title=Nishi Trishna|date=2015-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj1QZKHIDF4|accessdate=2016-04-03}}</ref> In this movie, some friends plan to visit the infamous Garchampa Palace which had a bad reputation for demonic blood-sucking beings that were terrorising the locality. They ultimately solve the mystery, and kill the vampire and his mentor.\n\n''Putuler Protisodh'' (1998), directed by Rabi Kinagi, was also based on the supernatural. The movie's story revolves around a girl named Bini who was married to Avinash. She falls prey in the hands of her in-laws who ultimately murdered her. The soul of Bini enters her doll to take revenge. She kills her mother-in-law, father-in-law and her maternal uncle one by one, and finally wants to kill her husband. But Avinash's second wife Laxmi was able to free Bini's soul from the doll.\n\n''[[Jekhane Bhooter Bhoy]]'' (2012), directed by [[Sandip Ray]], is a movie based on three classic Bengali ghost stories. The stories are Satyajit Ray's ''Anath Babur Bhoy'', ''Brown Saheber Bari'' and, Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay's ''Bhoot Bhabishyat''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sandip Ray|title=Jekhane Bhooter Bhoy (2012) Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnxiaNGpJ0s}}</ref>\n\nProbably the most well-known film of horror genre in recent times is ''[[Bhooter Bhabishyat]]'' (2012), directed by Anik Dutta. It tells the story of a haunted mansion 'Choudhury Palace', where ghosts from different ethnic backgrounds and eras reside (a Bengali zamindar of 18th century, an actress of the 1930s, a modern rockstar, a soldier of Indian Army who died in Kargil, etc.). The film with its simple but humorous story went on to become a massive blockbuster of 2012.\n\n''[[Goynar Baksho]]'' (2013) is another popular film involving the supernatural. The film, directed by [[Aparna Sen]], is an adaptation of [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]]'s famous tale of 3 generations of women & their changing position in society as seen in relation to a box of jewels, handed down from one generation to the next.\n\n''[[Chhayamoy]]'' (2013) is another notable horror movie based on Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay's novel of the same name. The story is about Indrajit, a UK based scholar. While working to preserve historical documents he find a parchment from which he learns about treasures hidden in an old palace in Simulgarh, a village of West Bengal. Indrajit comes to the village, finds out the treasure, but, a local goon Gagan Sapui accuses him of robbery, beats him up and expels him out of the village. Sapui wants to melt those coins to make new jewellery. After being beaten up, Indrajit goes to forest near the village where he meets Chhayamoy, a benevolent ghost. After listening the incidence from Indrajit, Chhayamoy decides to teach Gagan a lesson.\n\nThe number of horror movies from Bangladeshi film industry are only a few, and most of these movies can be typically categorized as low-budget horror-comedy. Few such examples are ''Rokto Pipasha'' (2007),<ref>{{Citation|last=Tarkasa|first=Tars|title=Rokto Pipasha (Review)|date=2009|url=http://tarstarkas.net/2015/04/rokto-pipasha-review/}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Sohel Rana|title=Rokto Pipasha: Intro|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1cwbGWw9QU}}</ref> ''Daini Buri'' (2008)<ref>{{Citation|title=Daini Buri full movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-TbufDlssk}}</ref> and, ''Sedin Brishti Chilo'' (2014).<ref>{{Citation|title=Sedin Brishti Chilo (2014) Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6YFX9tyvoo}}</ref> Some Bangladeshi movies involving supernatural theme are stories about shapeshifting snakes or [[Ichchhadhari Nag]] that can take human form. Examples of such movies are ''Kal Naginir Prem'',<ref>{{Citation |title=Kal Naginir Prem Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs-2tEZHUK4 |via=YouTube}}</ref> ''Bishakto Nagin'',<ref>{{Citation|title=Bishakto Nagin Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbaWLMm_o_Y |via=YouTube}}</ref> ''Bishe Bhora Nagin'' (1999),<ref>{{Citation |title=Bishe Bhora Nagin Full Movie|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bB9WN6Fh8g |via=YouTube}}</ref> ''Sathi Hara Nagin'' (2011) etc.\n\n=== Radio and television ===\n\nA live radio program called '''Bhoot FM''' is being aired by Bangladeshi radio channel [[Radio Foorti]] 88.0 FM at 12:00 am, every Friday night.<ref name=\"bhoot-fm.com|title=Bhoot\"/> The program is being aired since August 13, 2010; and is hosted by RJ Russell. In this program, people from all over [[Bangladesh]] come and share their real-life experiences associated with ghosts, demons, jinns and the paranormal/supernatural. The Bengali community from all over the world also share their supernatural experiences by sending audio clips and email that is played/read in this program. Other such radio program was '''Dor''', aired by [[ABC Radio (Bangladesh)|ABC Radio]] 89.2 FM. Dor was recorded from different haunted places of Bangladesh, and is hosted by RJ Kebria along with RJ Suman and tarot card reader Radbi Reza. Similar kind of programs were also aired on TV channels, such as '''Moddhorater Train''' (meaning 'Midnight Train') by [[Maasranga Television]].\n\nThere are some radio programs which feature recitation of horror stories written by acclaimed writers.

[[Fairy tales]], both old and new, often use the concept of [[ghost]]s. In modern-day [[Bengali literature]], cinema and also in radio & television media, the references to ghosts are often found. There are also many alleged haunted sites in this region.  It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth. The common word for ghosts in Bengali is ''[[Bhoot (ghost)|bhoot]]'' or ''bhut'' ({{lang-bn|\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4}}). This word has an alternative meaning: 'past' in Bengali. Also, the word ''[[Preta|Pret]]'' (derived from Sanskrit 'Preta') is used in Bengali to mean ghost. In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident). Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death.\n\nThe Bengali Hindu community celebrates ''Bhoot Chaturdashi'', which normally occurs on the 14th day of ''Krishna Paksha'' (waning phase of moon) at the night before ''[[Kali Puja]]'' / ''Dipaboli'' festival. On this night, Bengalis light 14 earthen-lamps (''choddo prodip'') at their homes to appease the spirits of their past 14 generations of ancestors. It is believed that in the night before Kali Puja, the spirits of these ancestors descend upon earth, and these lamps help them find their loving homes.<ref>{{Citation|last=Indrajit Roy Choudhury|title=Bhoot Chaturdashi|url=https://indroyc.com/2015/11/09/todays-bhoot-chaturdashi/}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Festivals of India|title=Bhoot Chaturdashi 2016- The Indian Halloween Night|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Bhoot-Chaturdashi/}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Rohini Chatterji|title=Kosha mangsho and Bhoot Chaturdashi: Celebrating Kali Puja and Diwali, Bengali style|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/kosha-mangsho-and-bhoot-chaturdashi-celebrating-kali-puja-and-diwali-bengali-style-1762781.html}}</ref> Another popular belief is that [[Chamunda]] (a fearsome aspect of [[Kali]]) along with 14 other ghostly forms ward off the evil spirits from the house as 14 earthen-lamps are lit at different entrances and dark corners of the rooms.

The word ''Petni'' originated from the Sanskrit word ''Pretni'' (feminine gender of ''[[Preta]]''). The word ''Shakchunni'' comes from the Sanskrit word ''Shankhachurni''. It is a ghost of a married woman who usually wears a special kind of traditional bangles made of shell (called \u2018Shankha\u2019 in Bengali) in their hands, which is a sign of married woman in Bengal.\n[[File:Depiction of a Shakchunni spreading cow dung mixed water.jpg|250px|thumb|Depiction of a ''Shakchunni'' spreading cow dung mixed with water]]\n* '''Damori''': [[Tantra|Tantric]] practices and black magic have been very popular in rural Bengal in the past for many centuries.

Such people are said to have the power to invoke lower-level demonic/ ghostly entities such as ''Hakini, Shakhini'' (same as ''Shakchunni'') and ''Dakini''. Tantriks use these demonic spirits for soothsaying purposes, and also for causing harm to people. When superstitious rural people wanted to cause harm to an enemy, they went to the Tantriks to seek their help. A common practice was called \"Baan Mara\", a ritual by which the Tantriks used demonic forces to kill a person. In such cases, the victim is said to die by vomiting blood up their throat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/indian-gods-and-goddesses-yogini-shrines-and-saktipithas-set-of-2-volumes-NAL248/|title=Yogini Shrines and Saktipithas (Set of 2 Volumes)|website=Exotic India|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/damara-tantra-IDI630/|title=Damara Tantra|website=Exotic India|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> The two most higher-level tantric mantra are ''Kularnob'' and ''Moha Damor''.

Besho Bhoot are ghosts that live in bamboo gardens. People from rural Bengal believe that harmful ghosts live in bamboo gardens, and one should not walk pass these areas after dusk. It is said that when a bamboo leans or lays in the ground, no one should cross over it and should go around it. This is because when someone makes an attempt to cross the bamboo, the bamboo is pulled back straight up by an unseen force, and the person can die as a result. It is also reported that a gusty wind blows inside the bamboo garden while the weather is calm on the outside.<ref>{{Citation|last=Abdul Gaffar Ronnie|title=\u09ac\u09be\u0981\u09b6\u09ac\u09be\u0997\u09be\u09a8\u09c7 \u0995\u09bf \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09c7?|url=http://www.banglamail24.com/news/147631|access-date=19 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427153251/http://www.banglamail24.com/news/147631|archive-date=27 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://story.shishukishor.org/2016/02/blog-post_14.html?m=1|title=\u09ac\u09c7\u0981\u09b6\u09cb \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 - \u09a8\u099c\u09b0\u09c1\u09b2 \u0987\u09b8\u09b2\u09be\u09ae|last=shishu kishor (Bengali)|website=story.shishukishor.org|access-date=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n* '''Penchapechi''': An unusual form of ghost.

The word ''Mechho'' comes from ''Machh'' that means 'fish' in Bengali. Mechho Bhoot usually lives near to the village ponds or lakes which are full of fish.  These kinds of ghosts urges the late night fishermen or a lone person who carries fish with him to give them their fish by saying in a nasal tone - \"Machh Diye Ja\" (meaning \"give me the fish\"). If the person refuses to leave the fish for the Mechho Bhoot, it threatens to harm them. Sometimes they steal fish from kitchens in village households or from the boats of fishermen.\n* '''Mamdo Bhoot''': According to the beliefs of Bengali Hindu community, these are believed to be the ghosts of [[Muslims]].

This marsh light ([[Will-o'-the-wisp]]) often look like a flying, glowing orb of fire. These confuse the fishermen, and is said to lure them out and then drown them into the very depths of water, never to rise again. Like Nishi, their voice is also said to be irresistible. Local communities in the region believe that these are the ghosts of fisherman who died fishing. The fishermen of Sundarban delta region, especially the Khasti and Manna fishermen communities, strongly believe in these and always do an'''''<nowiki/>''''' ''<nowiki/>'<nowiki/>''A'''''<nowiki/>'''''toshi-tar'''''<nowiki/>'''''on ritual before they go out for fishing. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://booksobsession.blogspot.com/2009/10/hbt-guest-post-with-author-saundra.html|title=Blog post by the author Saundra Mitchel of the novel \"Shadowed Summer\" at Books Obsession|website=Booksobsession.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Begho Bhoot''': The word ''Begho'' comes from the Bengali word ''Baagh'' meaning 'tiger'.

The villagers living in the area believe in these kinds of ghosts. These entities are said to frighten people who enters the jungle in search of honey or woods, and try to bring them to face tigers.

These are believed to be the spirit of those people who died by having their heads cut-off by train accident or by some other way.

The victim, instead of going into his destination, goes to another place which is silent and eerie. After that the victim loses his sense. These types of ghosts strike at night. Lone travellers, or a person separated from his group becomes the victim of such ghosts.\n*'''Prapti''': The word ''Prapti'' is a Sanskrit one meaning 'to get something'. These are said to be ghosts of girls who had more than one lover, and suffered from indecision. These girls therefore committed suicide, thus 'getting freedom' from all the conflict. It is said that after the girl dies, her lovers also commit suicide to be with her, or the Prapti haunts them and drives them to insanity until they do so. But the irony is that after the lovers die, they still do no get the girl, who escapes after taking her revenge. Therefore, the ghosts of the lovers get stuck forever, searching for their love.\n* '''Dainee''':  Dainee means \"[[Witch]]\". ''Dainee'' is not actually soul or spirit, rather is a  living being. Usually in villages of Bengal, old suspicious women who know mumbo-jumbo and other witchcrafts or black magic are considered as ''Dainee''.

Boba attacks a person by strangling him when the person sleeps in a [[Supine position]]/ sleep on back. However, the scientific explanation is believed to be [[Sleep Paralysis]]. While a person is having sleep paralysis, he hallucinates in his [[REM sleep]] while the brain is functioning but the body is asleep. This actually causes the person to completely unable to move or speak, and results in to hallucinate weird entities such as an old hag (a witch-like demonic being). In Bangladesh, the phenomenon is called \"Bobaay Dhora\" (meaning \"Struck by Boba\").<ref>{{Citation|last=health.banglablog24.com|title=\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09c7\u09b2\u09be\u09af\u09bc \u2018\u09ac\u09cb\u09ac\u09be \u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09a7\u09b0\u09be\u2019 \u098f\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a4\u09bf\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09be\u09a8\u09c1\u09a8!|url=http://health.banglablog24.com/\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0-\u09ac\u09c7\u09b2\u09be\u09af\u09bc-\u09ac\u09cb\u09ac\u09be-\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4-\u09a7\u09b0\u09be/}}</ref>\n* '''Sheekol Buri / Jol-Pishach''': They are believed to dwell in the rivers, ponds, and lakes. They are called by different names in different localities of Bengal. Young women, who either committed suicide by drowning due to an unhappy marriage (they might have been jilted by their lovers or abused and harassed by their much older husbands), or who were violently drowned against their will (especially after becoming pregnant with unwanted children), must live out their designated time on earth and come back as such beings.  Her main purpose is, however, to lure young men and take them into the depths of said waterways where she would entangle their feet with her long hair and submerge them. Their hair is very long and always wet, and their eyes are without any iris. Like many fairies, they sometimes do take human lovers. Unfortunately, most of such unions end tragically for the human. As is usually the case, they extract a promise from her mortal lover and when such promise is broken, she reveals herself to be the supernatural creature she is, often taking the life of the human in the process. Their general habitat is water bodies even though they roam around the land/wilderness around the water and are also often seen sitting over trees at the dead of night. The concept of such supernatural beings is similar to that of [[Rusalka]] from Slavic mythology.\n* '''Nishi''': The Nishi (Night Spirit) lures its victim to a secluded area by calling to the person with the voice of a loved one. The Nishi only strikes at night, and once the victim responds to the call of Nishi, s/he becomes hypnotised, follow the voice, and are never seen again. So, it is unknown what happens to them. Some [[tantra|tantrics]] are said to nurture and conjure the Nishi, in order to use them to harm someone out of spite or revenge. The voice of Nishi (means 'Night') is known as \"Nishir Daak\" (Call of the Night Spirit). Bengali age old superstition suggests that [[Sleepwalking]] phenomenon is also caused by Nishi. According to folklore, the Nishi cannot call out more than twice, and so no one should answer a voice at night until being called at least three times.\n* '''Gudro Bonga''': Even though these as worshipped as demigods by the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] community (an indigenous tribe in Bengal), many Santhal families are said to nurture and look after these small dwarf-like (2\u20133 feet tall) creatures who look like small children. The word ''Gudro'' means 'small' and ''Bonga'' means 'demigod' in Santhal language. Santhals believe that these beings are keepers of hidden treasures on earth and can make them rich. These beings are believed to steal newborn infants from people's houses. Gudro Bongas are believed to live in clans. They are similar to the concept of [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]] or [[Goblin]]s.<ref>{{Citation|last=\u09a8\u09be\u09ab\u09bf\u099c \u09ae\u09c1\u09a8\u09a4\u09be\u09b8\u09bf\u09b0|title=\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09bf\u099b\u09c1 \u099c\u09be\u09af\u09bc\u0997\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09be\u09a8\u09be-\u0985\u099c\u09be\u09a8\u09be \u09b8\u09ac \u09ad\u09cc\u09a4\u09bf\u0995 \u0998\u099f\u09a8\u09be|url=http://www.somoyerkonthosor.com/old/archives/120418|access-date=23 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807100247/http://www.somoyerkonthosor.com/old/archives/120418|archive-date=7 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* '''Dhan Kudra''': Experiences with such of entities are found in the myths of Bengal(specially south Bengal). They usually are short in height. It is a belief that they stay in somebody's house and they help the house-owner to make money. They are believed to bring luck. They are possibly similar to Domovoi\u2019s of Russian folklores.\n* '''[[Rakshasa|Rakkhosh]]''': A demonic fierce-looking being with pointed fangs, sharp claw-like fingernails, and superhuman strength. The stories of these creatures feature in the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. A lot of fairy-tale stories in Bengali folklore also speaks of this vicious demonic tribe which feeds on human. Bengali women traditionally put their children to sleep by narrating scary folk-tale stories of the ''Rakkhosh''. The threat punchline by a Rakkhosh in traditional Bengali folk-tales is this couplet: ''Hau, Mau, Cau,....Manusher Gondho Pau'' (meaning: \"Hau, Mau, Cau (nonsensical rhyming words),....I Smell a Human\"). Similar to \u201cfi fie foe...\u201d, the catchphrase associated with giants in some folklore.\n*'''Khokkosh''': These are dwarf-like malicious and grotesque monster, which is depicted as a smaller version of ''Rakkhosh''. The stories of ''Khokkosh'' is frequently found in traditional Bengali fairy-tales and folk-lores. \n*'''[[Daitya|Daittyo]]''': They have human appearance, but of prodigious size and extraordinary strength.

She drains their blood, semen, and virility. She dwells and prowls in places associated with death and filth. They are similar to the western concept of [[ghoul]]s.\n* '''[[Vetala|Betaal]]''': Betaal are defined as spirits inhabiting cadavers and charnel grounds. These evil spirits may use corpses as vehicles for movement (as they no longer decay while so inhabited); but a Betaal may also leave the corpse at will.\n* '''[[Yaksha|Jokkho / Jokkh]]''': A supernatural warrior-type entity who are the guardians and protectors of hidden treasures/wealth on earth. They are usually considered to be benevolent, and said to bestow fertility and wealth upon their devotees.

Jinns can be both benevolent or malevolent. Malevolent Jinns ([[Demon]]) can be really evil, and can cause haunting in human residences, empty houses, toilets, lakes, graveyards, morgues, hospitals, and in the wilderness. Some people are also believed to conjure Jinns, and use them to fulfil their evil purposes. When a Jinn is in the vicinity, a person might experience a strange perfume/flowery smell or terrible odour of rotten flesh, or burning odour even though no possible source of those smell/odour can be found. Jinns have no physical body of their own, and are creatures from an unseen dimension/realm. Jinns are shape-shifters, and often take the form of a human or animal (commonly snake, dog, cat, crow, or bull). When Jinn attaches itself to a living person, people call it jinn/demonic possession. Jinns are exorcised by pious people like [[Imam]] or [[Mawlana]] by reciting chapters from the [[Quran]]. Professional village exorcists/ witch-doctors called [[Kabiraj]] / [[Ojha]] commands/forces the Jinn to leave the possessed person by exorcism rituals which includes the use of talismans/ [[Ta'wiz]]/Tabiz, or by conjuring a good Jinn to counteract the forces of the possessing evil Jinn. Jinns have the ability to predict future, can read people's thoughts, have extraordinary strength and powers; and a person possessed by a Jinn can also demonstrate such abilities. However, Jinns are dimwitted, foolhardy, aggressive, angry and deceives humans with their lies. There are also good and wise jinns who are believed to be pious and save/help human from dangerous/ fatal situations.  Jinns are believed to eat raw fish/meat/bones and are fond of traditional Bengali sweets. The sweet salespeople in Bangladesh strongly affirm the idea that Jinns come to the sweet shops at late night in human form to buy sweets. Jinns live in clans, and every clan is headed by a King Jinn. There are several distinct classes of Jinn, such as [[Marid]], [[Ifreet]] and [[Ghul]] (Ghoul) and [[Qareen]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKL3AgAAQBAJ|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|last=Lebling|first=Robert|date=2010-07-30|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857730633|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMEipdTtH9oC|title=The Vengeful Djinn: Unveiling the Hidden Agenda of Genies|last=Guiley|first=Rosemary Ellen|last2=Imbrogno|first2=Philip J.|date=2011-07-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9780738728810|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ittefaq.com.bd/print-edition/drishtikon/2014/10/03/7337.html|title=\u099c\u09bf\u09a8 \u09ae\u09bf\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09bf \u0996\u09be\u09af\u09bc!|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The Daily Ittefaq]]|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/tmag/2014/oct/31/fear-street|title=Fear Street |work=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Alleged haunted places ==\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n[[File:Lalbagh Fort, south entrance, south view Dhaka 1875.jpg|thumbnail|Lalbagh Fort, south entrance, south view (1875)|200px]]\n\n[[Lalbagh Fort]], Golf Heights Banani, Airport Road, [[Uttara (Dhaka)|Uttara]] Sector-3 in [[Dhaka]]; [[Chalan Beel]] in [[Sirajganj]], Foy's Lake, Pakri Beach, Mirsarai Highway Crossing in [[Chittagong]] and many other places in Bangladesh is claimed to be haunted.<ref name=\"daily-sun.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/86647/HAUNTED-TALES:-IN-CONVERSATION-WITH-%E2%80%98DHAKA-PARANORMAL-SOCIETY%E2%80%99|title=HAUNTED TALES: IN CONVERSATION WITH \u2018DHAKA PARANORMAL SOCIETY\u2019|website=daily-sun.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Sami Tahsin|title=The Clandestine Adversary: Bangladeshi Hauntings 101|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-clandestine-adversary-bangladeshi-hauntings-101 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref>\n* '''[[Lalbagh Fort|Lalbagh Fort, Dhaka]]''': Lalbagh Fort near Dhaka is one of the most haunted place in Bangladesh.

It has been a legend for a long time that in the full moon night, Pari Bibi appear on the fort, singing and dancing. Another well-known haunting myth of Lalbagh Fort is the ghost of a man on his horse, who gets in and out of the fort at night. They say this apparition actually goes for his prayers. Normally, prayer time starts around 5 am. However, when people see this ghost, they hear the call for prayer coming from the prayer room at around 3 am, which is absurd. When they rush to see what is happening inside the prayer room, they find it completely empty. In other rumours, there is a hidden passageway to Agra (presently in India) from this fort. Local legends say, whoever found this passageway and entered it, has never returned. However, the doorways that claimed to have connected to Agra had been sealed long ago by the British rulers after a mystical occurrence happened to an investigation team. The team was searching for the end of the hidden passageway with their dogs chained by the team members. First they sent their dogs to enter the dark passage but when they pulled their chain they saw the dogs disappeared. The British rulers also sent some elephants in this tunnel, but according to legend, none of them ever returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hauntedbangla.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/haunted-locations-in-bangladesh-part-i.html|title=Haunted Bangladesh: Haunted Locations In Bangladesh Part - I|website=hauntedbangla.blogspot.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Foy's Lake 2 by Rahat.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Foy's Lake, Chittagong]]\n* '''[[Foy's Lake|Foy's Lake, Chittagong]]''': The famous Foy's Lake in Chittagong is known for its long-standing reputation of being haunted.

The soul of Bini enters her doll to take revenge. She kills her mother-in-law, father-in-law and her maternal uncle one by one, and finally wants to kill her husband. But Avinash's second wife Laxmi was able to free Bini's soul from the doll.\n\n''[[Jekhane Bhooter Bhoy]]'' (2012), directed by [[Sandip Ray]], is a movie based on three classic Bengali ghost stories.

It tells the story of a haunted mansion 'Choudhury Palace', where ghosts from different ethnic backgrounds and eras reside (a Bengali zamindar of 18th century, an actress of the 1930s, a modern rockstar, a soldier of Indian Army who died in Kargil, etc.). The film with its simple but humorous story went on to become a massive blockbuster of 2012.\n\n''[[Goynar Baksho]]'' (2013) is another popular film involving the supernatural. The film, directed by [[Aparna Sen]], is an adaptation of [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]]'s famous tale of 3 generations of women & their changing position in society as seen in relation to a box of jewels, handed down from one generation to the next.\n\n''[[Chhayamoy]]'' (2013) is another notable horror movie based on Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay's novel of the same name. The story is about Indrajit, a UK based scholar. While working to preserve historical documents he find a parchment from which he learns about treasures hidden in an old palace in Simulgarh, a village of West Bengal. Indrajit comes to the village, finds out the treasure, but, a local goon Gagan Sapui accuses him of robbery, beats him up and expels him out of the village. Sapui wants to melt those coins to make new jewellery. After being beaten up, Indrajit goes to forest near the village where he meets Chhayamoy, a benevolent ghost. After listening the incidence from Indrajit, Chhayamoy decides to teach Gagan a lesson.\n\nThe number of horror movies from Bangladeshi film industry are only a few, and most of these movies can be typically categorized as low-budget horror-comedy.
