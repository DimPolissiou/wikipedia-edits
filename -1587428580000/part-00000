In 1980, federal funds accounted for 22% of big city budgets, but by 1989 the similar aid composed only 6% of urban revenue (part of a larger 60% decrease in federal spending to support local governments).<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\">Common Dreams: [http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0610-01.htm Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516100105/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0610-01.htm |date=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> It is largely (although not exclusively) in these urban areas that homelessness became widespread and reached unprecedented numbers. Most notable were cuts to federal low-income housing programs. An advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for [[public housing]] and [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (the government's housing voucher subsidization program) and that between the years of 1980 and 1989 HUD's budget authority was reduced from $74 billion to $19 billion.<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\"/> Such alleged changes are claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of [[affordable housing]] to meet the growing demand of low-income populations. In 1970 there were 300,000 more low-cost rental units (6.5 million) than low-income renter households (6.2 million). By 1985, the advocacy group claimed that the number of low-cost units had fallen to 5.6 million, and the number of low-income renter households had grown to 8.9 million, a disparity of 3.3 million units.<ref>National Housing Institute: [http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html Reagan's Legacy: Homelessness in America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027055709/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html |date=October 27, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s and after many years of advocacy and numerous revisions, President Reagan signed into law the [[McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] in 1987; this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people. The McKinney\u2013Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the coming years. During the 1990s [[homeless shelters]], [[soup kitchens]], and other supportive services sprouted up in cities and towns across the nation. However, despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth marked by this decade, homeless numbers remained stubbornly high.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} It became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to alleviate the symptoms of homelessness (i.e. shelter beds, hot meals, psychiatric counseling, etc.), although needed, were not successful at solving the root causes of homelessness.

Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report, which revealed the number of individuals and families that were homeless, both sheltered and unsheltered.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = Huduser.org |title = First Annual Homelessness Assessment Report |url = http://www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/ahar.pdf}}</ref> In 2009, there were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide. About two-thirds of those stayed in emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs, with the remaining living on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.<ref name=\"hudd\">{{cite web |url = http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/5thHomelessAssessmentReport.pdf |title = HUD 5th Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress |date = June 2010 |website = Huduser.org |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> Around 44% of homeless people were employed.<ref>[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/employment.html Employment and Homelessness].

More than 40 percent of sheltered homeless people have a disability. At the same time, sizable segments of the sheltered homeless population are white, non-Hispanic (38 percent), children (20 percent), or part of multi-person households (33 percent). Approximately 68 percent of the 1.6 million sheltered homeless people were homeless as individuals and 32 percent were persons in families.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, [http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/povsoc/ahar_4.html \"The Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (2008)\"], July 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2008 more than 66 percent of all sheltered homeless people were located in principal cities, with 32 percent located in suburban or rural jurisdictions. About 40 percent of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation (sheltered or unsheltered), 40 percent came from a housed situation (in their own or someone else's home), and the remaining 20 percent were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters: 60 percent stayed less than a month, and a 33 percent stayed a week or less.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\"/>\n\n==== Causes ====\nLack of affordable housing as a cause of homelessness was named by most of the mayors in 2004 when the United States Conference of Mayors surveyed the mayors of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness. The next three causes identified by mayors, in rank order, were mental illness or the lack of needed services, substance abuse and lack of needed services, and low-paying jobs. The lowest ranking cause, cited by five mayors, was [[prisoner reentry]].

Although many medical, psychiatric, and counseling services exist to address these needs, it is commonly believed that without the support of reliable and stable housing such treatments remain ineffective. Furthermore, in the absence of a [[universal healthcare]] plan, many of those in need cannot afford such services. Proposed legislation such as the [[Bringing America Home Act]] are intended to provide comprehensive treatment for many homeless mental and substance abuse patients.\n\n=== Policies ===\n{{USgovtPOV|section|date=August 2017}}\nThere are several policies dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the government decided to start sending funding to people that are homeless, but it was not until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} As it was shown though seventy percent required homeless people to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there. In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem. Later on, the ''No Child Left Behind Act'' of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (NAEH) in 2000. The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. \n\nIn 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made \"ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective.\" The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The \"Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/odep/programs/homeless.htm |title = U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 ODEP \u2013 Office of Disability Employment Policy \u2013 Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing Projects |publisher = Dol.gov |date = September 29, 2003 |accessdate = August 1, 2013 }}</ref> initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hud.gov/ |title = Locating New Page |website = Hud.gov|accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> and the Department of Labor (DOL).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/ |title = United States Department of Labor |website = Dol.gov |date = March 23, 2017 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> The initiative offered $10 million from HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8 is the core housing program that helps extremely low-income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community. The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the number of vouchers granted to the population of people that are homeless.\n\n=== Public libraries ===\n\nPublic libraries can and often do significantly assist with the issues presented by homelessness. In many communities, the library is the only facility that offers free computer and internet access, so this is where many people experiencing homelessness go to locate services for basic needs such as healthcare, education, and housing. Libraries computers are also necessary for building a resume, searching for open jobs in the area, and completing job applications.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/nashville-library-homeless_n_6746162.html |title = How Libraries Are Adapting To Help Homeless Find Jobs, Health Services |work = The Huffington Post |date = February 24, 2015 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe news article and video entitled, \"SF library offers Social Services to Homeless,\"<ref>{{cite web |last = Tyler |first = Carolyn |url = http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&id=7459632 |title = San Francisco library offers social services to homeless &#124; abc7news.com |website = Abclocal.go.com |date = May 24, 2010 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> speaks about the San Francisco library having a full-time social worker at the library to reduce and help homeless patrons.

She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight, 2010).<ref>Knight, H. (January 11, 2010).

Education of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the [[cycle of poverty]]. The McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless students. This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education. These barriers include residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation issues. Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness, while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it's the only thing that remains normal.<ref name=\"NPR\">Abramson, Larry, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95222948 \"Amid Foreclosures, A Rise In Homeless Students\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'' program, NPR, September 30, 2008.</ref> Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders, and lack of attendance in school.<ref>Nieves, Evelyn, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/WireStory?id=6497841&page=1 \"In Tough Times, Ranks of Homeless Students Rising: School districts find unprecedented increase in numbers of homeless students across US\"], Associated Press, December 19, 2008</ref>\n\nSince the [[United States housing bubble]] collapse, there has been a rise in the number of homeless students.

Due to underfunding many school districts are struggling to provide the necessary services to support homeless students, as mandated in the provisions of the McKinney\u2013Vento Act, such as rising transportation needs and the greater range and usefulness of services. [[Wisconsin Rapids]] Public Schools Homeless Liaison Heather Lisitza says:\n\n{{quote|quote=One of the biggest challenges our district faces is providing transportation to students who are experiencing homelessness. There are few approaches that our district can utilize to provide transportation for these students. Our city has only one taxi cab service and no public bus system. Our cab company is small and simply cannot fulfill all of our transportation requests. When it's possible, we add students to existing bus routes or set up a contractual agreement with the student's parent/guardian. However, there have been many situations where none of these options have worked. Another challenge our district faces is providing proper outer-wear for students who are homeless. Being that we live in central Wisconsin and have long, cold winters, all students need proper outerwear to go outside. Proper outerwear includes snow boots, hat, mittens, snow pants, and a winter jacket that has a working zipper or buttons on it. This expense adds up quickly and is hard to provide to the increasing number of homeless students.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>}}\n\nThis is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in reading; 2) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in spelling; and 3) 2.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in math.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>\nThere are a few worries that there will be false reports of homeless students, but mostly it's not an issue.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Criminalization|Criminalization of homelessness}} ===\n\nVarious laws have both directly and indirectly [[Criminalization of homelessness|criminalized people that are homeless]]<ref>[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] (August 10, 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/10/america-poverty-criminalised \"How America criminalised poverty\"] ''The Guardian''</ref> and people attempting to feed homeless people outdoors.<ref>Baylen Linnekin (June 9, 2012) [http://reason.com/archives/2012/06/09/bans-on-feeding-homeless-have-always-bee \"Bans on Feeding the Homeless Are Discriminatory and Unconstitutional\"] ''Reason.org''</ref> At least 31 cities have criminalized feeding people that are homeless.<ref>Robbie Couch (November 3, 2014).

The NCH called those acts [[hate crime]]s (they retain the definition of the American Congress).

Another approximation is from a study done by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty which states that approximately 3.5 million people, 1.35 million of them children, are likely to experience homelessness in a given year (National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, 2007 |accessdate = August 2, 2011 }}</ref> Most were homeless temporarily.

Most notable were cuts to federal low-income housing programs. An advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for [[public housing]] and [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (the government's housing voucher subsidization program) and that between the years of 1980 and 1989 HUD's budget authority was reduced from $74 billion to $19 billion.<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\"/> Such alleged changes are claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of [[affordable housing]] to meet the growing demand of low-income populations. In 1970 there were 300,000 more low-cost rental units (6.5 million) than low-income renter households (6.2 million). By 1985, the advocacy group claimed that the number of low-cost units had fallen to 5.6 million, and the number of low-income renter households had grown to 8.9 million, a disparity of 3.3 million units.<ref>National Housing Institute: [http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html Reagan's Legacy: Homelessness in America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027055709/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html |date=October 27, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s and after many years of advocacy and numerous revisions, President Reagan signed into law the [[McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] in 1987; this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people. The McKinney\u2013Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the coming years.

More than 40 percent of sheltered homeless people have a disability. At the same time, sizable segments of the sheltered homeless population are white, non-Hispanic (38 percent), children (20 percent), or part of multi-person households (33 percent).

About 40 percent of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation (sheltered or unsheltered), 40 percent came from a housed situation (in their own or someone else's home), and the remaining 20 percent were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters: 60 percent stayed less than a month, and a 33 percent stayed a week or less.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\"/>\n\n==== Causes ====\nLack of affordable housing as a cause of homelessness was named by most of the mayors in 2004 when the United States Conference of Mayors surveyed the mayors of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness. The next three causes identified by mayors, in rank order, were mental illness or the lack of needed services, substance abuse and lack of needed services, and low-paying jobs.

Although many medical, psychiatric, and counseling services exist to address these needs, it is commonly believed that without the support of reliable and stable housing such treatments remain ineffective. Furthermore, in the absence of a [[universal healthcare]] plan, many of those in need cannot afford such services. Proposed legislation such as the [[Bringing America Home Act]] are intended to provide comprehensive treatment for many homeless mental and substance abuse patients.\n\n=== Policies ===\n{{USgovtPOV|section|date=August 2017}}\nThere are several policies dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the government decided to start sending funding to people that are homeless, but it was not until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} As it was shown though seventy percent required homeless people to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there. In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem. Later on, the ''No Child Left Behind Act'' of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (NAEH) in 2000. The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. \n\nIn 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made \"ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective.\" The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The \"Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/odep/programs/homeless.htm |title = U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 ODEP \u2013 Office of Disability Employment Policy \u2013 Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing Projects |publisher = Dol.gov |date = September 29, 2003 |accessdate = August 1, 2013 }}</ref> initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hud.gov/ |title = Locating New Page |website = Hud.gov|accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> and the Department of Labor (DOL).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/ |title = United States Department of Labor |website = Dol.gov |date = March 23, 2017 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> The initiative offered $10 million from HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8 is the core housing program that helps extremely low-income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community. The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the number of vouchers granted to the population of people that are homeless.\n\n=== Public libraries ===\n\nPublic libraries can and often do significantly assist with the issues presented by homelessness. In many communities, the library is the only facility that offers free computer and internet access, so this is where many people experiencing homelessness go to locate services for basic needs such as healthcare, education, and housing. Libraries computers are also necessary for building a resume, searching for open jobs in the area, and completing job applications.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/nashville-library-homeless_n_6746162.html |title = How Libraries Are Adapting To Help Homeless Find Jobs, Health Services |work = The Huffington Post |date = February 24, 2015 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe news article and video entitled, \"SF library offers Social Services to Homeless,\"<ref>{{cite web |last = Tyler |first = Carolyn |url = http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&id=7459632 |title = San Francisco library offers social services to homeless &#124; abc7news.com |website = Abclocal.go.com |date = May 24, 2010 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> speaks about the San Francisco library having a full-time social worker at the library to reduce and help homeless patrons.

She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight, 2010).<ref>Knight, H. (January 11, 2010).

Education of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the [[cycle of poverty]]. The McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless students. This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education. These barriers include residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation issues. Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness, while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it's the only thing that remains normal.<ref name=\"NPR\">Abramson, Larry, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95222948 \"Amid Foreclosures, A Rise In Homeless Students\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'' program, NPR, September 30, 2008.</ref> Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders, and lack of attendance in school.<ref>Nieves, Evelyn, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/WireStory?id=6497841&page=1 \"In Tough Times, Ranks of Homeless Students Rising: School districts find unprecedented increase in numbers of homeless students across US\"], Associated Press, December 19, 2008</ref>\n\nSince the [[United States housing bubble]] collapse, there has been a rise in the number of homeless students.

Due to underfunding many school districts are struggling to provide the necessary services to support homeless students, as mandated in the provisions of the McKinney\u2013Vento Act, such as rising transportation needs and the greater range and usefulness of services. [[Wisconsin Rapids]] Public Schools Homeless Liaison Heather Lisitza says:\n\n{{quote|quote=One of the biggest challenges our district faces is providing transportation to students who are experiencing homelessness. There are few approaches that our district can utilize to provide transportation for these students. Our city has only one taxi cab service and no public bus system. Our cab company is small and simply cannot fulfill all of our transportation requests. When it's possible, we add students to existing bus routes or set up a contractual agreement with the student's parent/guardian. However, there have been many situations where none of these options have worked. Another challenge our district faces is providing proper outer-wear for students who are homeless. Being that we live in central Wisconsin and have long, cold winters, all students need proper outerwear to go outside. Proper outerwear includes snow boots, hat, mittens, snow pants, and a winter jacket that has a working zipper or buttons on it. This expense adds up quickly and is hard to provide to the increasing number of homeless students.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>}}\n\nThis is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in reading; 2) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in spelling; and 3) 2.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in math.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>\nThere are a few worries that there will be false reports of homeless students, but mostly it's not an issue.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Criminalization|Criminalization of homelessness}} ===\n\nVarious laws have both directly and indirectly [[Criminalization of homelessness|criminalized people that are homeless]]<ref>[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] (August 10, 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/10/america-poverty-criminalised \"How America criminalised poverty\"] ''The Guardian''</ref> and people attempting to feed homeless people outdoors.<ref>Baylen Linnekin (June 9, 2012) [http://reason.com/archives/2012/06/09/bans-on-feeding-homeless-have-always-bee \"Bans on Feeding the Homeless Are Discriminatory and Unconstitutional\"] ''Reason.org''</ref> At least 31 cities have criminalized feeding people that are homeless.<ref>Robbie Couch (November 3, 2014).

The game is a prequel to ''[[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean]]''. Unlike the first game, which was published by then-Monolith Soft owner [[Namco]], ''Origins'' was published by [[Nintendo]], and was not released in Europe.<ref name=\"xplay\">{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/games/gc/33892/Baten-Kaitos-Origins/review/ |title=Baten Kaitos Origins for GameCube - Reviews |first=D.

Rather than equipping characters with weapons and armor, these are drawn from the deck during battles and equipped only temporarily.  Hence, equipment and even attack types exist as cards, rather than as statistics associated with the characters.  Because of this, many of the game's quests provide new Magnus cards as rewards, which can then be incorporated into decks as needed.\n\nThe combat system is substantially different when compared to that of the original ''Baten Kaitos''. Instead of each character having their own deck of Magnus cards, all characters use cards from a single deck and play from a single hand. Since most armor, weapons, and special attacks are specific to a given character, there are frequently times when one or two of the characters have only a very limited number of options.  Because of this streamlining, the game focuses primarily on increasingly numbered card combos, instead of some of the more elaborate combinations that were possible in ''Baten Kaitos''.  Nonetheless, it is possible for one to maintain separate decks (such as a fire-based deck, a heal-heavy deck, etc.) and to then switch to the appropriate deck as needed between fights. Combat is more speed driven, and the player does not need to use a turn to 'reshuffle' their deck, as cards are automatically recycled as they're disposed.\n\nAs before, the game uses a separate Quest Magnus mechanism which allows various key items to be stored on blank cards. This is expanded from the first game, giving the player a much larger amount of blank Magnus (nearly 3 times as many as the first game), and a much larger variety of magnus, which can provide bonuses or negative effects.  These items can be used at the appropriate time, or can be combined using a Magnus Mixer.  In many cases, the quest Magnus cards age and decay over time. For example, pristine water slowly becomes drinking water, which then becomes stale water. Battle Magnus can be \"upgraded\" by being combined with proper Quest Magnus. For example, the battle magnus \"Saber\", can be combined with the Quest Magnus \"Blaze\" to create a stronger Battle Magnus, \"Flame sword\". In contrast to the previous game, the ''Battle Magnus'' cards which make up the combat decks do not decay or change over time.\n\nThe game also features several new locales, such as Sedna, a town that looks like it's made of childish clay sculptures, and Hassaleh, a new continent that did not appear in the first game. Sedna is composed of different Magnus pieces which, as the player discovers and returns with the appropriate Magnus cards, spontaneously appear. As the town grows, the player can then interact with the new inhabitants.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Settings and characters===\nThe game takes place twenty years prior to the events of the first title, ''[[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean]]'', and features younger versions of many characters from the prior entry, though none of the same playable characters. The overall theme is that of a struggle between \"pro-magnation\" (the power of hearts, wings of the heart, and magic) and \"pro-machination\" (mechanical) forces.\n\n===Plot===\n''Baten Kaitos Origins'' takes place 20 years prior to the events of the original ''Baten Kaitos''. The main character, Sagi, works for the Alfard Empire in an elite unit, the Dark Service, that reports directly to a powerful politician, Lord Baelheit. He is joined by Guillo, who, while resembling a  mechanized puppet, is actually sentient and animated by magic. At the start of the game, the unit is given a dubious assignment to assassinate Emperor Olgan, although the ultimate source of the order is unclear.  Before the two have a chance to actually carry out or reflect on the morality of this act, Olgan is killed by a third party.  Blamed for the murder, Sagi and Guillo are then forced to flee, with a man named Geldoblame helping them in escaping while suggesting they meet up with his master, Quaestor Verus, due to Sagi and Verus both being summoners. During their escape, they encounter a giant beast called an Umbra, which Guillo has been mysteriously programmed to defeat. While trying to leave the city, they meet up with the third member of the party, a young woman named Milly.  The three of them must work to clear Sagi's name while trying to uncover the nature of the threat caused by the maneuvering of Alfard's various power-hungry politicians, as they work under Alfard's Quaestor Verus.\n\nThe main enemy in ''Baten Kaitos Origins'' eventually turns out to be a being named Wiseman, a sorcerer with a thirst to turn every being in the world into pure Magnus.  As Sagi, Milly and Guillo go back and forth between the present and a \"dream world\", they eventually discover the reason why the evil god Malpercio was created. Near the end of the game, it is revealed that the spirit which the player actually plays is connected to that world, and that Sagi is not a spiriter at all, but is instead part of the Empire's ''malideiter project''.  This came about as a result of experiments which Lord Baelheit was ordered to perform on behalf of Emperor Olgan in an effort to create artificial spiriters, rivaling their power with Malpercio's ''afterlings''.  Although the experiments were ultimately abandoned after a mishap, the test subjects were released still containing pieces of Malpercio. Years later, while stopping the maniacal plots of the politicians, Sagi learns of his true nature and must attempt to reach equilibrium with the being inside him or risk certain death.\n\nSlightly later in the tale, Milly's true intentions are revealed, as well as her past, and connection to Baelheit.  Near the ending, Baelheit also reveals that Milly is half-Machina; when she was just a child, a failed experiment (along the lines of the one which created Sagi's \"spirit\") tore her in half and killed her mother.  With the help of his own guardian spirit, Baelheit managed to revive Milly using Machina.\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest obstacles encountered during the quest is the ''Machina Vanguard'', consisting of three high-ranking Mintaken officers, Valara, Heughes and Nasca (who is Heughes' younger brother), who report to Lord Balheit. They hold the power of Machina Armas, the strongest weapons in Machina warfare, and thwart the plans of Sagi and his comrades several times over the course of the adventure. However, after joining powers with the force inside him, Sagi acquires immense strength.  With this strength, he is finally able to defeat the Machina Vanguard that were ''pro-machinating'' each of the floating continents.  He then sets off to defeat Baelheit once and for all. In the interim, though, Baelheit finishes construction on a huge flying fortress built completely out of machina called Tarazed.  He orders that everyone move onto the fortress, as he intends to destroy the continents.  Verus orders Sagi to stop Baelheit, and although Sagi does so, Verus reveals he has been pulling the strings and using the group for his own ends. The group defeats him, but Wiseman, who had possessed Verus, attacks the group. With the aid of the members of Malpercio, Sagi is able to defeat Wiseman, but this leads to Tarazed's collapse.\n\nSagi, Milly and Guillo flee, aided by previously defeated villains, Nasca, Heughes and Valara.  Guillo sacrifices itself to save Sagi. Sagi and Milly return to Alfard, happily reunite with family and friends, and eventually decide to [[elope]] and move to Mira. Verus's prior assistant, Geldoblame, having been backstabbed by Verus before his demise, returns to Alfard and becomes the new emperor and instructs people under him to locate the five \"End Magnus\" and to bring the researcher Georg before him, setting up the premise of [[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean|the first ''Baten Kaitos'' game]].

Rather than equipping characters with weapons and armor, these are drawn from the deck during battles and equipped only temporarily.  Hence, equipment and even attack types exist as cards, rather than as statistics associated with the characters.  Because of this, many of the game's quests provide new Magnus cards as rewards, which can then be incorporated into decks as needed.\n\nThe combat system is substantially different when compared to that of the original ''Baten Kaitos''. Instead of each character having their own deck of Magnus cards, all characters use cards from a single deck and play from a single hand. Since most armor, weapons, and special attacks are specific to a given character, there are frequently times when one or two of the characters have only a very limited number of options.  Because of this streamlining, the game focuses primarily on increasingly numbered card combos, instead of some of the more elaborate combinations that were possible in ''Baten Kaitos''.  Nonetheless, it is possible for one to maintain separate decks (such as a fire-based deck, a heal-heavy deck, etc.) and to then switch to the appropriate deck as needed between fights. Combat is more speed driven, and the player does not need to use a turn to 'reshuffle' their deck, as cards are automatically recycled as they're disposed.\n\nAs before, the game uses a separate Quest Magnus mechanism which allows various key items to be stored on blank cards. This is expanded from the first game, giving the player a much larger amount of blank Magnus (nearly 3 times as many as the first game), and a much larger variety of magnus, which can provide bonuses or negative effects.  These items can be used at the appropriate time, or can be combined using a Magnus Mixer.  In many cases, the quest Magnus cards age and decay over time. For example, pristine water slowly becomes drinking water, which then becomes stale water. Battle Magnus can be \"upgraded\" by being combined with proper Quest Magnus. For example, the battle magnus \"Saber\", can be combined with the Quest Magnus \"Blaze\" to create a stronger Battle Magnus, \"Flame sword\". In contrast to the previous game, the ''Battle Magnus'' cards which make up the combat decks do not decay or change over time.\n\nThe game also features several new locales, such as Sedna, a town that looks like it's made of childish clay sculptures, and Hassaleh, a new continent that did not appear in the first game. Sedna is composed of different Magnus pieces which, as the player discovers and returns with the appropriate Magnus cards, spontaneously appear. As the town grows, the player can then interact with the new inhabitants.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Settings and characters===\nThe game takes place twenty years prior to the events of the first title, ''[[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean]]'', and features younger versions of many characters from the prior entry, though none of the same playable characters. The overall theme is that of a struggle between \"pro-magnation\" (the power of hearts, wings of the heart, and magic) and \"pro-machination\" (mechanical) forces.\n\n===Plot===\n''Baten Kaitos Origins'' takes place 20 years prior to the events of the original ''Baten Kaitos''. The main character, Sagi, works for the Alfard Empire in an elite unit, the Dark Service, that reports directly to a powerful politician, Lord Baelheit. He is joined by Guillo, who, while resembling a  mechanized puppet, is actually sentient and animated by magic. At the start of the game, the unit is given a dubious assignment to assassinate Emperor Olgan, although the ultimate source of the order is unclear.  Before the two have a chance to actually carry out or reflect on the morality of this act, Olgan is killed by a third party.  Blamed for the murder, Sagi and Guillo are then forced to flee, with a man named Geldoblame helping them in escaping while suggesting they meet up with his master, Quaestor Verus, due to Sagi and Verus both being summoners. During their escape, they encounter a giant beast called an Umbra, which Guillo has been mysteriously programmed to defeat. While trying to leave the city, they meet up with the third member of the party, a young woman named Milly.  The three of them must work to clear Sagi's name while trying to uncover the nature of the threat caused by the maneuvering of Alfard's various power-hungry politicians, as they work under Alfard's Quaestor Verus.\n\nThe main enemy in ''Baten Kaitos Origins'' eventually turns out to be a being named Wiseman, a sorcerer with a thirst to turn every being in the world into pure Magnus.  As Sagi, Milly and Guillo go back and forth between the present and a \"dream world\", they eventually discover the reason why the evil god Malpercio was created. Near the end of the game, it is revealed that the spirit which the player actually plays is connected to that world, and that Sagi is not a spiriter at all, but is instead part of the Empire's ''malideiter project''.  This came about as a result of experiments which Lord Baelheit was ordered to perform on behalf of Emperor Olgan in an effort to create artificial spiriters, rivaling their power with Malpercio's ''afterlings''.  Although the experiments were ultimately abandoned after a mishap, the test subjects were released still containing pieces of Malpercio. Years later, while stopping the maniacal plots of the politicians, Sagi learns of his true nature and must attempt to reach equilibrium with the being inside him or risk certain death.\n\nSlightly later in the tale, Milly's true intentions are revealed, as well as her past, and connection to Baelheit.  Near the ending, Baelheit also reveals that Milly is half-Machina; when she was just a child, a failed experiment (along the lines of the one which created Sagi's \"spirit\") tore her in half and killed her mother.  With the help of his own guardian spirit, Baelheit managed to revive Milly using Machina.\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest obstacles encountered during the quest is the ''Machina Vanguard'', consisting of three high-ranking Mintaken officers, Valara, Heughes and Nasca (who is Heughes' younger brother), who report to Lord Balheit. They hold the power of Machina Armas, the strongest weapons in Machina warfare, and thwart the plans of Sagi and his comrades several times over the course of the adventure. However, after joining powers with the force inside him, Sagi acquires immense strength.  With this strength, he is finally able to defeat the Machina Vanguard that were ''pro-machinating'' each of the floating continents.  He then sets off to defeat Baelheit once and for all. In the interim, though, Baelheit finishes construction on a huge flying fortress built completely out of machina called Tarazed.  He orders that everyone move onto the fortress, as he intends to destroy the continents.  Verus orders Sagi to stop Baelheit, and although Sagi does so, Verus reveals he has been pulling the strings and using the group for his own ends. The group defeats him, but Wiseman, who had possessed Verus, attacks the group. With the aid of the members of Malpercio, Sagi is able to defeat Wiseman, but this leads to Tarazed's collapse.\n\nSagi, Milly and Guillo flee, aided by previously defeated villains, Nasca, Heughes and Valara.  Guillo sacrifices itself to save Sagi. Sagi and Milly return to Alfard, happily reunite with family and friends, and eventually decide to [[elope]] and move to Mira. Verus's prior assistant, Geldoblame, having been backstabbed by Verus before his demise, returns to Alfard and becomes the new emperor and instructs people under him to locate the five \"End Magnus\" and to bring the researcher Georg before him, setting up the premise of [[Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean|the first ''Baten Kaitos'' game]]. The game's last screen features an image of a baby with only one wing apparent, largely implied to be a character from the sequel, who would be an adult by that time.\n\n==Development and release==\nThe existence of the second ''Baten Kaitos'' game was first mentioned in ''[[Famits\u016b]]'' as one of the titles to be unveiled at the 2005 [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Baten Kaitos 2 Revealed |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/650/650871p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>  Originally planned for release in December of that year, it actually didn't see store shelves until several months later, in February.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Casamassina |title=Baten Kaitos 2: Good and Bad News |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/660/660460p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=October 21, 2005 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> The game was released in Japan and North America, but not in Europe, unlike the original entry, which released in all three regions.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/07/nintendos-divided-divisions</ref> Unlike a number GameCube titles developed late in its lifespan, development of ''Baten Kaitos Origins'' was not transitioned to Nintendo's then-upcoming hardware, the [[Wii]], which was scheduled for release just months after ''Origins''.

In [[Idaho]], the Interstate Highway runs exactly {{convert|196|mi|km}} from the [[Utah]] state line near [[Woodruff, Idaho|Woodruff]] north to the [[Montana]] state line at [[Monida Pass]]. I-15 is the primary north&ndash;south highway of [[Eastern Idaho]]. The Interstate Highway connects [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], the fourth and fifth largest cities in Idaho, and the smaller [[county seats]] of [[Malad City, Idaho|Malad City]], [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]], and [[Dubois, Idaho|Dubois]]. I-15 connects all of those cities with [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] to the south and [[Butte, Montana|Butte]] to the north. The Interstate has [[List of business routes of the Interstate Highway System|business loops]] through [[McCammon, Idaho|McCammon]], [[Inkom, Idaho|Inkom]], Pocatello, Blackfoot, and Idaho Falls.\n\n==Route description==\nI-15 is designated the Veterans Memorial Highway for its entire length in Idaho.\n\n===Woodruff to Pocatello===\nI-15 enters [[Oneida County, Idaho|Oneida County]] from [[Box Elder County, Utah]], south of the hamlet of Woodruff. The four-lane Interstate heads north parallel to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]'s Malad Subdivision rail line, a road named Old Highway 191, and the [[Malad River (Utah)|Malad River]] along the eastern edge of the wide Malad Valley adjacent to the Malad Range. I-15 has a [[diamond interchange]] with Woodruff Road at Woodruff and follows the western edge of [[Caribou National Forest]]. The highway passes just to the east of the county seat, Malad City, where the highway has a diamond interchange with the eastern end of [[Idaho State Highway 38]] (SH 38). I-15 continues along Deep Creek to another diamond interchange with the western end of [[Idaho State Highway 36|SH 36]]. From there, the Interstate follows the narrow valley of Devil Creek between the Bannock Range to the east and Elkhorn Mountain to the west. I-15 has one more diamond interchange in Oneida County next to Devils Creek Reservoir before the highway reaches Malad Summit, where the highway leaves the [[Great Salt Lake]] watershed and enters the [[Snake River]] watershed.\n\nI-15 enters [[Bannock County, Idaho|Bannock County]] and descends into the Marsh Valley, named for Marsh Creek, which the highway begins to parallel at its diamond interchange with [[Idaho State Highway 40|SH 40]], which heads east toward [[Downey, Idaho|Downey]]. At a diamond interchange at the hamlet of Virginia, the Interstate begins to run concurrently with [[U.S. Route 91 in Idaho|U.S. Route 91]] (US 91) and parallel Union Pacific's Pocatello Subdivision rail line and Old Highway 91. I-15 and US 91 have diamond interchanges with Arimo Road just west of [[Arimo, Idaho|Arimo]] and with the southern end of [[Interstate 15 Business (McCammon, Idaho)|I-15 Bus.]] south of McCammon. At the north end of McCammon, the Interstate reconnects with its business route and is joined by [[U.S. Route 30 in Idaho|US 30]]. I-15 heads north through Indian Rocks State Park along a ridge between Marsh Creek to the west and the [[Portneuf River (Idaho)|Portneuf River]] to the east, then crosses the Portneuf River just east of its confluence with Marsh Creek.\n\nI-15 crosses over the rail line and Old Highway 91 as it curves west to follow the narrow valley of the Portneuf River between the Bannock Range to the south and the Pocatello Range to the north. The highway has partial interchanges with [[Interstate 15 Business (Inkom, Idaho)|I-15 Bus.]] on either side of the tiny city of Inkom. I-15 begins to curve north at its four-ramp [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange with Old Highway 91 at Portneuf shortly before entering the city of Pocatello. US 30 and US 91 split off from the Interstate at the next interchange, a diamond interchange with Fifth Avenue that marks the southern end of [[Interstate 15 Business (Pocatello, Idaho)|Pocatello's I-15 Bus]]. I-15 veers away from the rail line and the Portneuf River, has a diamond interchange with Clark Street east of downtown Pocatello, and collects the other end of I-15 Bus. at its diamond interchange with Pocatello Creek Road. The Interstate leaves the city of Pocatello at its [[directional T interchange]] with [[Interstate 86 (Idaho)|I-86]].

In [[Idaho]], the Interstate Highway runs exactly {{convert|196|mi|km}} from the [[Utah]] state line near [[Woodruff, Idaho|Woodruff]] north to the [[Montana]] state line at [[Monida Pass]]. I-15 is the primary north&ndash;south highway of [[Eastern Idaho]]. The Interstate Highway connects [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], the fourth and fifth largest cities in Idaho, and the smaller [[county seats]] of [[Malad City, Idaho|Malad City]], [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]], and [[Dubois, Idaho|Dubois]]. I-15 connects all of those cities with [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] to the south and [[Butte, Montana|Butte]] to the north. The Interstate has [[List of business routes of the Interstate Highway System|business loops]] through [[McCammon, Idaho|McCammon]], [[Inkom, Idaho|Inkom]], Pocatello, Blackfoot, and Idaho Falls.\n\n==Route description==\nI-15 is designated the Veterans Memorial Highway for its entire length in Idaho.\n\n===Woodruff to Pocatello===\nI-15 enters [[Oneida County, Idaho|Oneida County]] from [[Box Elder County, Utah]], south of the hamlet of Woodruff. The four-lane Interstate heads north parallel to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]'s Malad Subdivision rail line, a road named Old Highway 191, and the [[Malad River (Utah)|Malad River]] along the eastern edge of the wide Malad Valley adjacent to the Malad Range. I-15 has a [[diamond interchange]] with Woodruff Road at Woodruff and follows the western edge of [[Caribou National Forest]]. The highway passes just to the east of the county seat, Malad City, where the highway has a diamond interchange with the eastern end of [[Idaho State Highway 38]] (SH 38). I-15 continues along Deep Creek to another diamond interchange with the western end of [[Idaho State Highway 36|SH 36]]. From there, the Interstate follows the narrow valley of Devil Creek between the Bannock Range to the east and Elkhorn Mountain to the west. I-15 has one more diamond interchange in Oneida County next to Devils Creek Reservoir before the highway reaches Malad Summit, where the highway leaves the [[Great Salt Lake]] watershed and enters the [[Snake River]] watershed.\n\nI-15 enters [[Bannock County, Idaho|Bannock County]] and descends into the Marsh Valley, named for Marsh Creek, which the highway begins to parallel at its diamond interchange with [[Idaho State Highway 40|SH 40]], which heads east toward [[Downey, Idaho|Downey]]. At a diamond interchange at the hamlet of Virginia, the Interstate begins to run concurrently with [[U.S. Route 91 in Idaho|U.S. Route 91]] (US 91) and parallel Union Pacific's Pocatello Subdivision rail line and Old Highway 91. I-15 and US 91 have diamond interchanges with Arimo Road just west of [[Arimo, Idaho|Arimo]] and with the southern end of [[Interstate 15 Business (McCammon, Idaho)|I-15 Bus.]] south of McCammon. At the north end of McCammon, the Interstate reconnects with its business route and is joined by [[U.S. Route 30 in Idaho|US 30]]. I-15 heads north through Indian Rocks State Park along a ridge between Marsh Creek to the west and the [[Portneuf River (Idaho)|Portneuf River]] to the east, then crosses the Portneuf River just east of its confluence with Marsh Creek.\n\nI-15 crosses over the rail line and Old Highway 91 as it curves west to follow the narrow valley of the Portneuf River between the Bannock Range to the south and the Pocatello Range to the north. The highway has partial interchanges with [[Interstate 15 Business (Inkom, Idaho)|I-15 Bus.]] on either side of the tiny city of Inkom. I-15 begins to curve north at its four-ramp [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange with Old Highway 91 at Portneuf shortly before entering the city of Pocatello. US 30 and US 91 split off from the Interstate at the next interchange, a diamond interchange with Fifth Avenue that marks the southern end of [[Interstate 15 Business (Pocatello, Idaho)|Pocatello's I-15 Bus]]. I-15 veers away from the rail line and the Portneuf River, has a diamond interchange with Clark Street east of downtown Pocatello, and collects the other end of I-15 Bus. at its diamond interchange with Pocatello Creek Road. The Interstate leaves the city of Pocatello at its [[directional T interchange]] with [[Interstate 86 (Idaho)|I-86]]. I-15 passes along the eastern edge of the city of [[Chubbuck, Idaho|Chubbuck]], which is accessed using I-86.\n\n===Pocatello to Monida Pass===\n[[File:I 15 US 20 Junction Sign.jpg|left|thumb|I-15/US-20 Jct. in [[Idaho Falls|Idaho Falls, ID]]]]\nI-15 continues north onto the [[Snake River Plain]] and into the [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation]]. The highway accesses the reservation's main settlement, [[Fort Hall, Idaho|Fort Hall]], via a diamond interchange with Ross Fork Road on the Bannock&ndash;[[Bingham County, Idaho|Bingham]] county line. I-15 has a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with US 91, at which the highway crosses over Union Pacific's Montana Subdivision rail line, near the northern edge of the reservation; [[Interstate 15 Business (Blackfoot, Idaho)|I-15 Bus.]] splits northeast with US 91 from this interchange. The Interstate curves northeast and crosses the [[Blackfoot River (Idaho)|Blackfoot River]] and begins to parallel the Snake River as it passes along the western edge of the city of Blackfoot. I-15 Bus. reconnects with I-15 at a diamond interchange with [[U.S. Route 26 in Idaho|US 26]] (Bridge Street), which runs concurrently with the Interstate leaving Blackfoot. The highway crosses the Snake River at the northern edge of the city. I-15 has a partial cloverleaf interchange near Rose before it crosses a pair of irrigation canals. The Interstate then travels across the eastern part of the [[Hell's Half Acre Lava Field]] ahead of its interchange with River Road, which provides access to [[Shelley, Idaho|Shelley]] east of the Snake River.\n\nI-15 enters [[Bonneville County, Idaho|Bonneville County]] one mile before its interchange with West 65th South near Woodville, which is simply given the destination of \"Exit 113\" northbound.<!-- please provide citation --> US 26 and [[Interstate 15 Business (Idaho Falls, Idaho)|I-15 Bus.]] split off onto Sunnyside Road shortly before I-15 enters Idaho Falls. The Interstate has a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with [[U.S. Route 20 in Idaho|US 20]] (West Broadway Street), from which [[U.S. Route 20 Business (Idaho Falls, Idaho)|US 20 Bus.]] splits east concurrent with I-15 Bus., which returns to the mainline Interstate. I-15 and US 20 run concurrently to a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange where US 20 heads northeast as a freeway towards [[Ucon, Idaho|Ucon]], [[Rigby, Idaho|Rigby]], [[Rexburg, Idaho|Rexburg]], [[Sugar City, Idaho|Sugar City]], [[Saint Anthony, Idaho|St. Anthony]], [[Ashton, Idaho|Ashton]], [[Island Park, Idaho|Island Park]], [[West Yellowstone, Montana|West Yellowstone]], and [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The Interstate heads north out of Idaho Falls parallel to the Montana Subdivision rail line, Old Highway 91, and the Snake River. I-15 enters [[Jefferson County, Idaho|Jefferson County]] just north of its diamond interchange with Osgood Road, and the freeway diverges from the Snake River at [[Roberts, Idaho|Roberts]], where it has a diamond interchange with the western end of [[Idaho State Highway 48|SH 48]].\n\nI-15 passes [[Market Lake Wildlife Management Area]] ahead of its diamond interchange with SH 23 at Sage Junction. The highway has a diamond interchange with Hamer Road at [[Hamer, Idaho|Hamer]] and briefly passes through the [[Camas National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses [[Camas Creek (Mud Lake)|Camas Creek]], which flows into [[Mud Lake (Jefferson County, Idaho)|Mud Lake]]. I-15 follows a tributary of Camas Creek, Beaver Creek, into [[Clark County, Idaho|Clark County]] and its county seat of [[Dubois, Idaho|Dubois]], where the Interstate meets the eastern end of [[Idaho State Highway 22|SH 22]] at a diamond interchange. North of Dubois, the freeway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Sheep Station Road that serves the [[U.S. Sheep Experiment Station]].

Orans point out that Freeman's basic criticisms, that Mead was duped by ceremonial virgin Fa'apua'a Fa'amu (who later swore to Freeman that she had played a joke on Mead) were equivocal for several reasons: first, Mead was well aware of the forms and frequency of Samoan joking; second, she provided a careful account of the sexual restrictions on ceremonial virgins that corresponds to Fa'apua'a Fa'auma'a's account to Freeman, and third, that Mead's notes make clear that she had reached her conclusions about Samoan sexuality before meeting Fa'apua'a Fa'amu.   Orans points out that Mead's data support several different conclusions, and that Mead's conclusions hinge on an interpretive, rather than positivist, approach to culture. Orans goes on to point out, concerning Mead's work elsewhere, that her own notes do not support her published conclusive claims.

The lack of male dominance may have been the result of the Australian administration's outlawing of warfare. According to contemporary research, males are dominant throughout [[Melanesia]] (although some believe that female [[witch]]es have special powers){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. Others have argued that there is still much cultural variation throughout Melanesia, and especially in the large island of [[New Guinea]]. Moreover, anthropologists often overlook the significance of networks of political influence among females.  The formal male-dominated institutions typical of some areas of high population density were not, for example, present in the same way in Oksapmin, West Sepik Province, a more sparsely populated area. Cultural patterns there were different from, say, Mt. Hagen. They were closer to those described by Mead.\n\nMead stated that the [[Arapesh people]], also in the Sepik, were [[pacifist]]s, although she noted that they do on occasion engage in warfare. Her observations about the sharing of garden plots among the Arapesh, the [[egalitarian]] emphasis in child rearing, and her documentation of predominantly peaceful relations among relatives are very different from the \"big man\" displays of dominance that were documented in more stratified New Guinea cultures\u2014e.g. by Andrew Strathern. They are a different cultural pattern.\n\nIn brief, her comparative study revealed a full range of contrasting gender roles:\n*\"Among the Arapesh, both men and women were peaceful in temperament and neither men nor women made war.\n*\"Among the [[Mundugumor people|Mundugumor]], the opposite was true:  both men and women were warlike in temperament.\n*\"And the Tchambuli were different from both.

Gewertz states that as far back in history as there is evidence (1850s) Chambri men dominated over the women, controlled their produce and made all important political decisions. In later years there has been a diligent search for societies in which women dominate men, or for signs of such past societies, but none have been found (Bamberger, 1974).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vE85zkFdURQC&pg=PA263 Bamberger, Joan, ''The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society'', in M.

Press, 1974)], p.&nbsp;263.</ref> Jessie Bernard criticised Mead's interpretations of her findings, arguing that Mead was biased in her descriptions due to use of subjective descriptions. Bernard argues that while Mead claimed the Mundugumor women were temperamentally identical to men, her reports indicate that there were in fact sex differences; Mundugumor women hazed each other less than men hazed each other, they made efforts to make themselves physically desirable to others, married women had fewer affairs than married men, women were not taught to use weapons, women were used less as hostages and Mundugumor men engaged in physical fights more often than women. Conversely, the Arapesh were also described as equal in temperament, yet Bernard states that Mead's own writings indicate that men fought physically over women, yet women did not fight physically over men, despite the two being supposedly equal in temperament. The Arapesh also seemed to have some conception of sex differences in temperament, as they would sometimes describe a woman as acting like a particularly quarrelsome man. Bernard also questioned if the behaviour of men and women in these societies differed as much from Western behaviour as Mead claimed it did, arguing that some of her descriptions could be equally descriptive of a Western context.<ref>Kaplan, David, and Robert Alan Manners.

Mead felt the methodologies involved in the experimental psychology research supporting arguments of racial superiority in intelligence were substantially flawed. In \"The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology\" Mead proposes that there are three problems with testing for racial differences in intelligence. First, there are concerns with the ability to validly equate one's test score with what Mead refers to as ''racial admixture'' or how much ''Negro or Indian blood'' an individual possesses. She also considers whether this information is relevant when interpreting IQ scores. Mead remarks that a genealogical method could be considered valid if it could be \"subjected to extensive verification\". In addition, the experiment would need a steady control group to establish whether racial admixture was actually affecting intelligence scores. Next, Mead argues that it is difficult to measure the effect that social status has on the results of a person's intelligence test. By this she meant that  environment (i.e., family structure, socioeconomic status, exposure to language) has too much influence on an individual to attribute inferior scores solely to a physical characteristic such as race. Lastly, Mead adds that language barriers sometimes create the biggest problem of all. Similarly, Stephen J. Gould finds three main problems with intelligence testing, in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' that relate to Mead's view of the problem of determining whether there are indeed racial differences in intelligence.<ref>Mead, Margaret, \"The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 31, no. 5 (March 1926): 657\u2013667.</ref><ref>Gould, Stephen J.

Orans points out that Mead's data support several different conclusions, and that Mead's conclusions hinge on an interpretive, rather than positivist, approach to culture. Orans goes on to point out, concerning Mead's work elsewhere, that her own notes do not support her published conclusive claims.

The lack of male dominance may have been the result of the Australian administration's outlawing of warfare. According to contemporary research, males are dominant throughout [[Melanesia]] (although some believe that female [[witch]]es have special powers){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. Others have argued that there is still much cultural variation throughout Melanesia, and especially in the large island of [[New Guinea]]. Moreover, anthropologists often overlook the significance of networks of political influence among females.  The formal male-dominated institutions typical of some areas of high population density were not, for example, present in the same way in Oksapmin, West Sepik Province, a more sparsely populated area. Cultural patterns there were different from, say, Mt. Hagen. They were closer to those described by Mead.\n\nMead stated that the [[Arapesh people]], also in the Sepik, were [[pacifist]]s, although she noted that they do on occasion engage in warfare. Her observations about the sharing of garden plots among the Arapesh, the [[egalitarian]] emphasis in child rearing, and her documentation of predominantly peaceful relations among relatives are very different from the \"big man\" displays of dominance that were documented in more stratified New Guinea cultures\u2014e.g. by Andrew Strathern. They are a different cultural pattern.\n\nIn brief, her comparative study revealed a full range of contrasting gender roles:\n*\"Among the Arapesh, both men and women were peaceful in temperament and neither men nor women made war.\n*\"Among the [[Mundugumor people|Mundugumor]], the opposite was true:  both men and women were warlike in temperament.\n*\"And the Tchambuli were different from both.

Gewertz states that as far back in history as there is evidence (1850s) Chambri men dominated over the women, controlled their produce and made all important political decisions. In later years there has been a diligent search for societies in which women dominate men, or for signs of such past societies, but none have been found (Bamberger, 1974).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vE85zkFdURQC&pg=PA263 Bamberger, Joan, ''The Myth of Matriarchy: Why Men Rule in Primitive Society'', in M.

Press, 1974)], p.&nbsp;263.</ref> Jessie Bernard criticised Mead's interpretations of her findings, arguing that Mead was biased in her descriptions due to use of subjective descriptions. Bernard argues that while Mead claimed the Mundugumor women were temperamentally identical to men, her reports indicate that there were in fact sex differences; Mundugumor women hazed each other less than men hazed each other, they made efforts to make themselves physically desirable to others, married women had fewer affairs than married men, women were not taught to use weapons, women were used less as hostages and Mundugumor men engaged in physical fights more often than women. Conversely, the Arapesh were also described as equal in temperament, yet Bernard states that Mead's own writings indicate that men fought physically over women, yet women did not fight physically over men, despite the two being supposedly equal in temperament. The Arapesh also seemed to have some conception of sex differences in temperament, as they would sometimes describe a woman as acting like a particularly quarrelsome man. Bernard also questioned if the behaviour of men and women in these societies differed as much from Western behaviour as Mead claimed it did, arguing that some of her descriptions could be equally descriptive of a Western context.<ref>Kaplan, David, and Robert Alan Manners. Culture theory.

Mead felt the methodologies involved in the experimental psychology research supporting arguments of racial superiority in intelligence were substantially flawed. In \"The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology\" Mead proposes that there are three problems with testing for racial differences in intelligence. First, there are concerns with the ability to validly equate one's test score with what Mead refers to as ''racial admixture'' or how much ''Negro or Indian blood'' an individual possesses. She also considers whether this information is relevant when interpreting IQ scores. Mead remarks that a genealogical method could be considered valid if it could be \"subjected to extensive verification\". In addition, the experiment would need a steady control group to establish whether racial admixture was actually affecting intelligence scores. Next, Mead argues that it is difficult to measure the effect that social status has on the results of a person's intelligence test. By this she meant that  environment (i.e., family structure, socioeconomic status, exposure to language) has too much influence on an individual to attribute inferior scores solely to a physical characteristic such as race. Lastly, Mead adds that language barriers sometimes create the biggest problem of all. Similarly, Stephen J. Gould finds three main problems with intelligence testing, in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' that relate to Mead's view of the problem of determining whether there are indeed racial differences in intelligence.<ref>Mead, Margaret, \"The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 31, no. 5 (March 1926): 657\u2013667.</ref><ref>Gould, Stephen J.

Freeman argued instead that Samoan culture prized female chastity and virginity and that Mead had been misled by her female Samoan informants.

In raycounting a flat surface is conversed into a highly curved one through a specific layout of light parameters. An algorithm calculates the intensity, position, and direction of one or multiple light sources placed in a given environment and assigns local curvature values to the relation between geometry and light performance. Then produced by stereolithography, the three double layered, translucent objects show resin pockets wherever these surfaces intersected.<ref>Sterling, Bruce. \u201cNatural\u2019 3-D Objects.\u201d Abitare, Edited by Anniina Koivu , no. 482, May 2008, pp. 134\u2013137.</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Neri's Inspirations and Impact on Young Women In Materials Sciences. ==\nOxman's works tie together fantastical approaches of the humanities with the sciences and engineering. What's most fantastic is her particular ability to tie different cultures together in her work. Her radically interdisciplinary approaches and writings have inspired young women in the field of engineering to take an immensely creative approach to design. She describes her approach for the glass structures that her and her team created for Lexus \"formalism with a moral compass\", she states how beauty is a sign of usefulness. This depth of character and absolute wonder that she brings into materials and the study of the natural world continues to strike inspiration and genius into the hearts of young ambitious engineers who deeply admire her work. {{clear|left}}\n== Television appearances ==\nOxman is the focus of an episode of Netflix docu-series [[Abstract: The Art of Design]] (season 2, episode 2).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2019/09/20/netflix-abstract-the-art-of-design-2-olafur-eliasson/|title=Neri Oxman and Olafur Eliasson feature in second series of Netflix design documentary|date=2019-09-20|website=Dezeen|language=en|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n== Mediated Matter ==\nThe Mediated Matter group uses computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology to explore design possibilities in small and large structures.<ref name=\"oxmanlab\">{{cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/mediated-matter  |title=Mediated Matter group website |publisher=MIT Media Lab |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"weforum\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/towards-a-material-ecology/|title=What if our buildings were grown, not built?|author=Neri Oxman|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>  This sometimes involved taking images of a biological sample, developing algorithms to produce similar structures, and developing new manufacturing processes to realize the results.\nProjects have included wearables inspired by current and future environments,<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2012/05/design-fiction-neri-oxman-imaginary-beings-mythologies-of-the-not-yet/ Design Fiction: Neri Oxman, \u201cImaginary Beings: Mythologies of the Not Yet\u201d], Wired magazine.

It was woven by 6,500 free-ranging silkworms on a nylon-frame dome.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.materialecology.com/assets/pdf/Conf_FABRICATE_ArticleOxmanLaucks.pdf|title=Fabricate: Negotiating Design and Making|last=Oxman|first=Neri|last2=Laucks|first2=Jared|last3=Kayser|first3=Markus|display-authors=etal|publisher=gta Verlag|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=249\u2013255|chapter=Silk Pavilion: A case study in fibre-based digital fabrication}}</ref>  Experiments with the silkworms identified how they would respond to different surfaces, and what would encourage them to spin onto an existing structure rather than spinning a cocoon.  The frame of a large polyhedral dome was loosely woven by a robotic arm out of thin nylon threads, and suspended in an open room.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/thousands-of-silkworms-and-one-robot-made-this-intricat-511217252|title=Thousands of silkworms and one robot made this intricate sculpture|last=Dvorsky|first=George|work=io9|access-date=March 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>  The dome was designed with gaps where it would be warmest.  Silkworms were released onto the frame in waves, where they added layers of silk before being removed.  This involved engineering, [[sericulture]], and modelling sun in the room.  The resulting installation art was hung so that people could stand inside it.\n\nThe ''Ocean Pavilion,'' an installation from 2014, included a water-based fabrication platform where structures were built out of chitosan, a water-soluble organic fiber similar to chitin.  Structural pillars and long delicate leaves were made by varying how the fibers were deposited. The result was a combination of hard and soft structures, changing from solid to willowy over the length of a branch or leaf, but all made from the same base material.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''Synthetic Apiary'', a room-sized installation built in 2015, studied the behavior of bees in an entirely indoor environment, including how they built hives in and around different structures.

The group designed a prototype printer with a robotic arm that could build 8-foot tall structures all around itself in outdoor spaces, and a quick-curing printer that makes free-standing objects without support structures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://matter.media.mit.edu/publications/article/freeform-3d-printing-towards-a-sustainable-approach-to-additive-manufacturi|title=Freeform 3D Printing: Towards a Sustainable Approach to Additive Manufacturing|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|access-date=March 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113304/http://matter.media.mit.edu/publications/article/freeform-3d-printing-towards-a-sustainable-approach-to-additive-manufacturi|archive-date=March 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Oxman printed her first set of body-sized wearables, a collection titled ''Imaginary Beings'' and inspired by legendary creatures.  This was followed by ''Anthozoa'', a dress developed in collaboration with fashion designer [[Iris van Herpen]] and materials engineer Craig Carter. These were some of the first examples of multi-color and multi-material 3D printing a human scale,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.3dprinter.net/the-not-so-secret-stratasys-objet-multi-color-3d-printer|title=The not-so-secret Objet multi-color 3D printer|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2012|work=3D Printer|access-date=February 28, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> using a bright palette with fine granular control of color and texture.  In 2015, she designed the ''Wanderers'' collection with Christoph Bader and Dominik Kolb, inspired by ideas of interplanetary exploration. That earned Fast Company's award for Design Innovation.

In 2015, she designed ''Gemini'', a large chaise lounge combining a milled wood shell with a 3D-printed surface.

In raycounting a flat surface is conversed into a highly curved one through a specific layout of light parameters. An algorithm calculates the intensity, position, and direction of one or multiple light sources placed in a given environment and assigns local curvature values to the relation between geometry and light performance. Then produced by stereolithography, the three double layered, translucent objects show resin pockets wherever these surfaces intersected.<ref>Sterling, Bruce. \u201cNatural\u2019 3-D Objects.\u201d Abitare, Edited by Anniina Koivu , no. 482, May 2008, pp. 134\u2013137.</ref>\n\n{{clear|left}}\n=== Television appearances ===\nOxman is the focus of an episode of Netflix docu-series [[Abstract: The Art of Design]] (season 2, episode 2).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2019/09/20/netflix-abstract-the-art-of-design-2-olafur-eliasson/|title=Neri Oxman and Olafur Eliasson feature in second series of Netflix design documentary|date=2019-09-20|website=Dezeen|language=en|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n\n== Mediated Matter ==\nThe Mediated Matter group uses computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology to explore design possibilities in small and large structures.<ref name=\"oxmanlab\">{{cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/mediated-matter  |title=Mediated Matter group website |publisher=MIT Media Lab |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"weforum\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/towards-a-material-ecology/|title=What if our buildings were grown, not built?|author=Neri Oxman|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>  This sometimes involved taking images of a biological sample, developing algorithms to produce similar structures, and developing new manufacturing processes to realize the results.\nProjects have included wearables inspired by current and future environments,<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2012/05/design-fiction-neri-oxman-imaginary-beings-mythologies-of-the-not-yet/ Design Fiction: Neri Oxman, \u201cImaginary Beings: Mythologies of the Not Yet\u201d], Wired magazine.

The frame of a large polyhedral dome was loosely woven by a robotic arm out of thin nylon threads, and suspended in an open room.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/thousands-of-silkworms-and-one-robot-made-this-intricat-511217252|title=Thousands of silkworms and one robot made this intricate sculpture|last=Dvorsky|first=George|work=io9|access-date=March 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>  The dome was designed with gaps where it would be warmest.  Silkworms were released onto the frame in waves, where they added layers of silk before being removed.  This involved engineering, [[sericulture]], and modelling sun in the room.  The resulting installation art was hung so that people could stand inside it.\n\nThe ''Ocean Pavilion,'' an installation from 2014, included a water-based fabrication platform where structures were built out of chitosan, a water-soluble organic fiber similar to chitin.  Structural pillars and long delicate leaves were made by varying how the fibers were deposited. The result was a combination of hard and soft structures, changing from solid to willowy over the length of a branch or leaf, but all made from the same base material.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''Synthetic Apiary'', a room-sized installation built in 2015, studied the behavior of bees in an entirely indoor environment, including how they built hives in and around different structures.  This was developed in collaboration with a beekeeping company, as a way of testing possible responses to colony loss, and exploring how biological niches could be explicitly integrated into buildings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.archdaily.com/796769/neri-oxman-plus-mediated-matter-create-synthetic-apiaries-to-combat-honeybee-colony-loss|title=Neri Oxman + Mediated Matter Create Synthetic Apiary to Combat Honeybee Colony Loss|date=October 5, 2016|newspaper=ArchDaily|language=en-US|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 3D printing developments ===\nMediated Matter worked extensively with various 3D printing techniques, developing their own methods and collaborating with printing companies such as [[Stratasys]].  Projects have ranged in scale from enclosures and large furniture, to artwork and clothes, to biocomposites, artificial valves, and DNA assembly. The group designed a prototype printer with a robotic arm that could build 8-foot tall structures all around itself in outdoor spaces, and a quick-curing printer that makes free-standing objects without support structures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://matter.media.mit.edu/publications/article/freeform-3d-printing-towards-a-sustainable-approach-to-additive-manufacturi|title=Freeform 3D Printing: Towards a Sustainable Approach to Additive Manufacturing|last=|first=|date=2013|website=|access-date=March 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113304/http://matter.media.mit.edu/publications/article/freeform-3d-printing-towards-a-sustainable-approach-to-additive-manufacturi|archive-date=March 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Oxman printed her first set of body-sized wearables, a collection titled ''Imaginary Beings'' and inspired by legendary creatures.  This was followed by ''Anthozoa'', a dress developed in collaboration with fashion designer [[Iris van Herpen]] and materials engineer Craig Carter. These were some of the first examples of multi-color and multi-material 3D printing a human scale,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.3dprinter.net/the-not-so-secret-stratasys-objet-multi-color-3d-printer|title=The not-so-secret Objet multi-color 3D printer|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2012|work=3D Printer|access-date=February 28, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> using a bright palette with fine granular control of color and texture.  In 2015, she designed the ''Wanderers'' collection with Christoph Bader and Dominik Kolb, inspired by ideas of interplanetary exploration. That earned Fast Company's award for Design Innovation. The most influential of the Wanderers was the ''Living Mushtari'' chestpiece, a model digestive tract filled with liquid and a colony of photosynthetic [[Cyanobacteria|bacteria]] and ''[[E. coli]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mit-professor-creates-3d-printed-wearable-skin-space-exploration-1477862|title=MIT professor creates 3D printed 'wearable skin' for space exploration|date=December 3, 2014|access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>  Producing ''Mushtari'' required new modeling methods for printing long flexible tubes with varying thickness.\n\nIn 2016, she produced ''Rottlace,'' a set of 3D-printed feathered, filamented, and textured masks.  These were made for the artist [[Bj\u00f6rk]],<ref>From \"Ro\u00f0laus\", Icelandic for \"skinless\".</ref> based on a 3D scan of her face.

Described as \"like something out of ''Alien''\", each mask is a curved translucent shell the size of a face, within which a detailed pattern is printed in clouds of color and shadow. This tested the limits of how small voxels of color could be inside a 3D printed solid.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/gallery/death-masks-neri-oxman-vesper|title=Haunting 3D-printed death masks are like something out of Alien|work=WIRED UK|access-date=March 10, 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\"vespers\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/vespers-the-latest-mask-collection-by-mits-neri-oxman_o|title=Vespers, the Latest Mask Collection by MIT's Neri Oxman|date=December 15, 2016|work=Architect|access-date=March 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOxman has also premiered new printing tools and processes. In 2015, she designed ''Gemini'', a large chaise lounge combining a milled wood shell with a 3D-printed surface.  Both the outer shell and the texture of the inner surface were designed to produce a soothing acoustical environment for someone reclining in it. ''Gemini'' was later acquired by [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|SF MoMA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/neri-oxman-pursues-3d-printing-multi-materials-latest-mythical-installation-gemini-25368/|title=Neri Oxman Further Pursues 3D Printing with Multi-Materials for her Latest Mythical Installation \u2014 \"GEMINI\"|access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Matter-glass-printer.webm|thumb|The ''G3DP'' glass printing process]]\nAlso in 2015, a Mediated Matter team developed ''G3DP'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Additive Manufacturing of Optically Transparent Glass|last=Klein|first=John|publisher=Mediated Matter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> the first 3D printer for optically transparent glass.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.mit.edu/2015/3-d-printing-transparent-glass-0914|title=Printing transparent glass in 3-D|last=Chandler|first=David|date=September 14, 2015|work=MIT News|access-date=July 9, 2016|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://singularityhub.com/2015/09/09/watch-mits-breakthrough-3d-printer-pour-molten-glass-like-honey/|title=Watch MIT's Breakthrough 3D Printer Pour Molten Glass Like Honey|last=Dorrier|first=Jason|date=September 9, 2015|website=Singularity Hub|publisher=Singularity University|access-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref> At the time, sintering 3D printers could print with glass powder, but the results were brittle and opaque.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/401-you-can-now-3d-print-in-glass-with-shapeways.html|title=you can now 3D print in glass with Shapeways|last=joris|date=April 14, 2010|work=The Shapeways Blog|access-date=March 19, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> ''G3DP'' was designed in collaboration with MIT's Glass Lab and the [[Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering|Wyss Institute]], emulating traditional glass working processes.
