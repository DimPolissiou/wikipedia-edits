Fox genes are part of a forkhead DNA-binding domain family.  This domain binds to sequences in promoters and enhancers of many genes.  Foxp1 regulates a variety of important aspects of development including tissue development of: the lungs, brain, thymus and heart.  In the heart Foxp1 has 3 vital roles, these include the regulation of cardiac [[myocyte]] maturation and proliferation, outflow tract separation of the [[pulmonary artery]] and [[aorta]], and expression of [[SOX4|Sox4]] in cushions and myocardium.  Foxp1 is also an important gene in muscle development of the esophagus and esophageal epithelium.  Foxp1 is also an important regulator of lung airway morphogenesis. Foxp1 [[knockout mice|knockout]] embryos display severe defects in cardiac [[morphogenesis]].  A few of these defects include [[myocyte]] maturation and proliferation defects that cause a thin ventricular myocardial compact zone, non-separation of the [[pulmonary artery]] and [[aorta]], and [[cardiomyocyte]] proliferation increase and defective differentiation.  These defects, caused by Foxp1 inactivation, lead to fetal death.

In neuromuscular disease, a variety of factors can influence the compositional and micro structural aspects of muscle, including most notably muscle fiber [[atrophy]] and disorganization, the deposition of fat and connective tissues, as occurs in muscular dystrophy, and the presence of inflammation, among many other pathologies. EIM captures these changes in the tissue as a whole by measuring its impedance characteristics across multiple frequencies and at multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction.<ref name=GarNeuroMyo>{{cite journal | last= Garmirian | first= LP |author2=Chin AB |author3=Rutkove SB  | year= 2008 | journal= Muscle and Nerve | volume= 39 | issue= 1 | pages= 16\u201324 | pmid= 19058193 | doi= 10.1002/mus.21115 | pmc= 2719295 | title= Discriminating neurogenic from myopathic disease via measurement of muscle anisotropy }}</ref>\n\nIn EIM, impedance is separated into [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], its real and imaginary components.

EIM has shown a difference between anisotropy profiles of neuromuscular disease patients and healthy controls.  In addition, EIM can use anisotropy to discriminate between myopathic and neurogenic disease.<ref name=GarNeuroMyo/> Different forms of neuromuscular disease have unique anisotropies.  [[Myopathic]] disease is characterized by decreased anisotropy.  [[Neuropathy|Neurogenic]] disease produces a less predictable anisotropy. The angle of lowest phase may be shifted from the parallel position, and the anisotropy as a whole is often greater than that of a healthy control.\n\n== Measurement approaches ==\n\nIn general, to apply the technique, a minimum of four surface electrodes are placed over the muscle of interest.  A minute [[alternating current]] is applied across the outer two electrodes, and voltage signals are recorded by the inner electrodes.  The frequency of the applied current and the relationship of the electrode array to the major muscle fiber direction is varied so that a full multifrequency and multidirectional assessment of the muscle can be achieved.<ref name=InflamMyo/>\n\nEIM has been performed with a number of different impedance analysis devices.  Commercially available systems used for [[Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis|bioimpedance analysis]], can be calibrated to measure impedance of individual muscles.  A suitable impedance analyzer can also be custom built using a lock-in amplifier to produce the signal and a low-capacitance probe, such as the Tektronix P6243, to record voltages from the surface electrodes.<ref name=GarNeuroMyo/>\n\nSuch methods, however, are slow and clumsy to apply given the need for careful electrode positioning over a muscle of interest and the potential for misalignment of electrodes and inaccuracy. Accordingly, an initial hand-held system was constructed using multiple components with an electrode head that could be placed directly on the patient.<ref name=Probe>{{cite journal | last= Ogunnika | first= OT |author2=Scharfstien M |author3=Cooper RC |author4=Ma H |author5=Dawson JL |author6=Rutkove SB  | year= 2008 | title= A Handheld Electrical Impedance Myography Probe for the Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease | journal= Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc | volume= 2008 | pages= 3566\u20139 | pmid= 19163479 | doi= 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649976 | pmc= 2706091 | isbn= 978-1-4244-1814-5 }}</ref>  The device featured an array of electrode plates, which could be selectively activated to perform impedance measurements in arbitrary orientations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/412955/monitoring-muscle/|title=Monitoring Muscle|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>  The oscilloscopes were programmed to produce a compound sinusoid signal, which could be used to measure the impedance at multiple frequencies simultaneously via a Fast Fourier transform.\n\nSince that initial system was created, other handheld commercial systems are being developed, such as [[Skulpt]], for use in both neuromuscular disease assessment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skulpt.me/health/ |title=Skulpt Health |accessdate=13 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119033813/http://www.skulpt.me/health/ |archivedate=19 January 2016 }}</ref> and for fitness monitoring, including the calculation of a muscle quality (or MQ) value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skulpt.me/|title=Skulpt - Measure Body Fat Percentage and Muscle Quality|work=SKULPT|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> This latter value aims to provide an approximate assessment of the relative force-generating capacity of muscle for a given cross-sectional area of tissue. Muscle quality, for example, is a measure used in the assessment of [[sarcopenia]].\n\n== Comparison with standard bioelectrical impedance analysis ==\n\nStandard [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]] (BIA), like EIM, also employs a weak, high frequency electric current to measure characteristics of the human body. In standard BIA, unlike EIM, electric current is passed between electrodes placed on the hands and feet, and the impedance characteristics of the entire current path are measured. Thus, the measured impedance characteristics are relatively nonspecific since they encompass much of the body including the entire length of the extremities, the chest, abdomen and pelvis; accordingly, only summary whole-body measures of lean body mass and % fat can be offered. Moreover, in BIA, current travels the path of least resistance, and thus any factors that alter the current path will cause variability in the data. For example, the expansion of large vessels (e.g., veins) with increasing hydration will offer a low-resistance path, and thus distorting the resulting data. In addition, changes in abdominal contents will similarly alter the data. Body position can also have substantial effects, with joint position contributing to variations in the data. EIM, in contrast, measures only the superficial aspects of individual muscles and is relatively unaffected by body or limb position or hydration status.<ref>{{cite document|title=Error|doi=10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943641|pmid=25570009|pmc=4287983|year=2014|last1=Jia|first1=Li|last2=Sanchez|first2=B.|last3=Rutkove|first3=S.

In neuromuscular disease, a variety of factors can influence the compositional and micro structural aspects of muscle, including most notably muscle fiber [[atrophy]] and disorganization, the deposition of fat and connective tissues, as occurs in muscular dystrophy, and the presence of inflammation, among many other pathologies. EIM captures these changes in the tissue as a whole by measuring its impedance characteristics across multiple frequencies and at multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction.<ref name=GarNeuroMyo>{{cite journal | last= Garmirian | first= LP |author2=Chin AB |author3=Rutkove SB  | year= 2008 | journal= Muscle and Nerve | volume= 39 | issue= 1 | pages= 16\u201324 | pmid= 19058193 | doi= 10.1002/mus.21115 | pmc= 2719295 | title= Discriminating neurogenic from myopathic disease via measurement of muscle anisotropy }}</ref>\n\nIn EIM, impedance is separated into [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], its real and imaginary components. From this, one can compute the muscle's phase, which represents the time-shift that a sinusoid undergoes when passing through the muscle.<ref name=LBA2002/>  For a given resistance (R) and reactance (X), phase (\u03b8) can be calculated. In current work, all three parameters appear to play important roles depending exactly on which diseases are being studied and how the technology is being applied.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nEIM can also be impacted by the thickness of the skin and subcutaneous fat overlying a region of muscle.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of subcutaneous fat on electrical impedance myography when using a handheld electrode array: the case for measuring reactance| pmc=3543755 | pmid=22917581 | doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2012.07.013| volume=124| issue=2 | year=2013| journal=Clin Neurophysiol| pages=400\u20134|vauthors=Sung M, Spieker AJ, Narayanaswami P, Rutkove SB }}</ref> However, electrode designs can be created that can circumvent the effect to a large extent and thus still provide primary muscle data.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Optimizing Electrode Configuration for Electrical Impedance Measurements of Muscle via the Finite Element Method| pmc=3984469 | pmid=23314763 | doi=10.1109/TBME.2012.2237030| volume=60| issue=5 | year=2013| journal=IEEE Trans Biomed Eng| pages=1446\u201352|vauthors=Jafarpoor M, Li J, White JK, Rutkove SB | url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/91024/1/White_Optimizing%20electrode.pdf}}</ref> Moreover, the use of multifrequency measurements can also assist with this process of disentangling the effects of fat from those of muscle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clinph-journal.com/article/S1388-2457(14)00256-9/abstract|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>  From this information, it also becomes possible to infer/calculate the approximate amount of fat overlying a muscle in a given region.\n\n== Multifrequency measurements ==\n\nBoth resistance and reactance depend on the input frequency of the signal.

By taking measurements at different angles with respect to muscle fibers, EIM can be used to determine the anisotropy of a given muscle.

EIM has shown a difference between anisotropy profiles of neuromuscular disease patients and healthy controls.  In addition, EIM can use anisotropy to discriminate between myopathic and neurogenic disease.<ref name=GarNeuroMyo/> Different forms of neuromuscular disease have unique anisotropies.  [[Myopathic]] disease is characterized by decreased anisotropy.  [[Neuropathy|Neurogenic]] disease produces a less predictable anisotropy. The angle of lowest phase may be shifted from the parallel position, and the anisotropy as a whole is often greater than that of a healthy control.\n\n== Measurement approaches ==\n\nIn general, to apply the technique, a minimum of four surface electrodes are placed over the muscle of interest.  A minute [[alternating current]] is applied across the outer two electrodes, and voltage signals are recorded by the inner electrodes.  The frequency of the applied current and the relationship of the electrode array to the major muscle fiber direction is varied so that a full multifrequency and multidirectional assessment of the muscle can be achieved.<ref name=InflamMyo/>\n\nEIM has been performed with a number of different impedance analysis devices.  Commercially available systems used for [[Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis|bioimpedance analysis]], can be calibrated to measure impedance of individual muscles.  A suitable impedance analyzer can also be custom built using a lock-in amplifier to produce the signal and a low-capacitance probe, such as the Tektronix P6243, to record voltages from the surface electrodes.<ref name=GarNeuroMyo/>\n\nSuch methods, however, are slow and clumsy to apply given the need for careful electrode positioning over a muscle of interest and the potential for misalignment of electrodes and inaccuracy. Accordingly, an initial hand-held system was constructed using multiple components with an electrode head that could be placed directly on the patient.<ref name=Probe>{{cite journal | last= Ogunnika | first= OT |author2=Scharfstien M |author3=Cooper RC |author4=Ma H |author5=Dawson JL |author6=Rutkove SB  | year= 2008 | title= A Handheld Electrical Impedance Myography Probe for the Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease | journal= Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc | volume= 2008 | pages= 3566\u20139 | pmid= 19163479 | doi= 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649976 | pmc= 2706091 | isbn= 978-1-4244-1814-5 }}</ref>  The device featured an array of electrode plates, which could be selectively activated to perform impedance measurements in arbitrary orientations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/412955/monitoring-muscle/|title=Monitoring Muscle|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>  The oscilloscopes were programmed to produce a compound sinusoid signal, which could be used to measure the impedance at multiple frequencies simultaneously via a Fast Fourier transform.\n\nSince that initial system was created, other handheld commercial systems are being developed, such as [[Skulpt]], for use in both neuromuscular disease assessment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skulpt.me/health/ |title=Skulpt Health |accessdate=13 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119033813/http://www.skulpt.me/health/ |archivedate=19 January 2016 }}</ref> and for fitness monitoring, including the calculation of a muscle quality (or MQ) value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skulpt.me/|title=Skulpt - Measure Body Fat Percentage and Muscle Quality|work=SKULPT|accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> This latter value aims to provide an approximate assessment of the relative force-generating capacity of muscle for a given cross-sectional area of tissue. Muscle quality, for example, is a measure used in the assessment of [[sarcopenia]].\n\n== Comparison with standard bioelectrical impedance analysis ==\n\nStandard [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]] (BIA), like EIM, also employs a weak, high frequency electric current to measure characteristics of the human body. In standard BIA, unlike EIM, electric current is passed between electrodes placed on the hands and feet, and the impedance characteristics of the entire current path are measured. Thus, the measured impedance characteristics are relatively nonspecific since they encompass much of the body including the entire length of the extremities, the chest, abdomen and pelvis; accordingly, only summary whole-body measures of lean body mass and % fat can be offered. Moreover, in BIA, current travels the path of least resistance, and thus any factors that alter the current path will cause variability in the data. For example, the expansion of large vessels (e.g., veins) with increasing hydration will offer a low-resistance path, and thus distorting the resulting data. In addition, changes in abdominal contents will similarly alter the data. Body position can also have substantial effects, with joint position contributing to variations in the data. EIM, in contrast, measures only the superficial aspects of individual muscles and is relatively unaffected by body or limb position or hydration status.<ref>{{cite document|title=Error|doi=10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943641|pmid=25570009|pmc=4287983|year=2014|last1=Jia|first1=Li|last2=Sanchez|first2=B.|last3=Rutkove|first3=S.

This period is characterized by frequent changes of presentations. The fetuses in breech presentation during this period have the same probability for breech and cephalic presentation at delivery.\n\nDuring the second period, lasting from the 25th to the 35th gestational week, the incidence of cephalic presentation increases, with a proportional decrease of breech presentation. The second period is characterized by a higher than random probability that the fetal presentation during this period will also be present at the time of delivery. The increase of this probability is gradual and identical for breech and cephalic presentations during this period.\n\nIn the third period, from the 36th gestational week onward, the incidence of cephalic and breech presentations remain stable, i.e. breech presentation around 3\u20134% and cephalic presentation approximately 95%.

If there is a delay in delivery, the brain can be damaged. Among full-term, head-down babies, cord prolapse is quite rare, occurring in 0.4 percent. Among frank breech babies the incidence is 0.5 percent,<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" /> among complete breeches 5 percent,<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" /> and among footling breeches 15 percent.<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" />\n\nHead entrapment is caused by the failure of the fetal head to negotiate the maternal midpelvis.  At full term, the fetal bitrochanteric diameter (the distance between the outer points of the hips) is about the same as the biparietal diameter (the transverse diameter of the skull)\u2014simply put the size of the hips are the same as the size of the head. The relatively larger buttocks dilate the cervix as effectively as the head does in the typical head-down presentation. In contrast, the relative head size of a [[preterm baby]] is greater than the fetal buttocks. If the baby is preterm, it may be possible for the baby's body to emerge while the cervix has not dilated enough for the head to emerge.\n\nBecause the umbilical cord\u2014the baby's oxygen supply\u2014is significantly compressed while the head is in the pelvis during a breech birth, it is important that the delivery of the aftercoming fetal head not be delayed.  If the arm is extended alongside the head, delivery will not occur. If this occurs, the ''[[L\u00f8vset's manoeuvre|L\u00f8vset manoeuvre]]'' may be employed, or the arm may be manually brought to a position in front of the chest.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tidy|first1=C|title=Breech Presentations |url=http://patient.info/doctor/breech-presentations|website=Patient|access-date=22 April 2016}}</ref> The L\u00f8vset manoeuvre involves rotating the fetal body by holding the fetal pelvis.  Twisting the body such that an arm trails behind the shoulder, it will tend to cross down over the face to a position where it can be reached by the obstetrician's finger, and brought to a position below the head. A similar rotation in the opposite direction is made to deliver the other arm. In order to present the smallest diameter (9.5&nbsp;cm) to the pelvis, the baby's head must be flexed (chin to chest). If the head is in a deflexed position, the risk of entrapment is increased.  Uterine contractions and maternal muscle tone encourage the head to flex.\n\n[[Oxygen deprivation]] may occur from either cord prolapse or prolonged compression of the [[umbilical cord|cord]] during birth, as in [[head entrapment]]. If [[oxygen deprivation]] is prolonged, it may cause permanent [[neurological]] damage (for instance, [[cerebral palsy]]) or [[death]]. It has been suggested that a fast vaginal delivery would mean the risk of stopping baby's oxygen supply is reduced.  However, there is not enough research to show this and a quick delivery might cause more harm to the baby than a conservative approach to the birth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Kulier|first2=R|last3=West|first3=HM|title=Expedited versus conservative approaches for vaginal delivery in breech presentation.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=21 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000082|pmid=26197303|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000082.pub3|pmc=6505640}}</ref>\n\n[[Injury]] to the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[Human skull|skull]] may occur due to the rapid passage of the baby's head through the mother's [[pelvis]]. This causes rapid decompression of the baby's head. In contrast, a baby going through labor in the head-down position usually experiences gradual molding (temporary reshaping of the skull) over the course of a few hours. This sudden compression and decompression in breech birth may cause no problems at all, but it can injure the brain. This injury is more likely in [[preterm]] babies. The fetal head may be controlled by a special two-handed grip call the Mariceau\u2013Smellie\u2013Veit manoeuvre or the elective application of forceps. This will be of value in controlling the rate of delivery of the head and reduce decompression. Related to potential head trauma, researchers have identified a relationship between breech birth and [[autism]].<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{cite journal | author = Bilder Deborah, Pinborough-Zimmerman Judith, Miller Judith, McMahon William | year = 2009 | title = Prenatal, Perinatal, and Neonatal Factors Associated With Autism Spectrum Disorders | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 123 | issue = 5| pages = 1293\u20131300 | doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0927}}</ref>\n\nSqueezing the baby's abdomen can damage internal organs. Positioning the baby incorrectly while using forceps to deliver the after coming head can damage the spine or spinal cord.  It is important for the birth attendant to be knowledgeable, skilled, and experienced with all variations of breech birth.\n\n===Factors influencing safety===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\n* Birth attendant's skill (and experience with breech birth) \u2013 The skill of the doctor or midwife and the number of breech births previously assisted is of crucial importance. Many of the dangers in vaginal birth for breech babies come from mistakes made by birth attendants. With the majority of breech babies being delivered by cesarean section there is more risk that birth attendants will lose their skills in delivering breech babies and therefore increase the risk of harm to the baby during a vaginal delivery.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Kotaska|first1=A|last2=Menticoglou|first2=S|last3=Gagnon|first3=R|last4=Farine|first4=D|last5=Basso|first5=M|last6=Bos|first6=H|last7=Delisle|first7=MF|last8=Grabowska|first8=K|last9=Hudon|first9=L|last10=Mundle|first10=W|last11=Murphy-Kaulbeck|first11=L|last12=Ouellet|first12=A|last13=Pressey|first13=T|last14=Roggensack|first14=A|last15=Maternal Fetal Medicine|first15=Committee|last16=Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of|first16=Canada|title=Vaginal delivery of breech presentation.|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada|date=June 2009|volume=31|issue=6|pages=557\u201366, 567\u201378|pmid=19646324|doi=10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34221-9}}</ref>\n* Type of breech presentation \u2013 the frank breech has the most favorable outcomes in vaginal birth, with many studies suggesting no difference in outcome compared to head down babies.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twG4F3gjA5YC|title=Anesthetic and Obstetric Management of High-Risk Pregnancy|last=Datta|first=Sanjay|date=2004-01-09|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780387004433|language=en}}</ref> (Some studies, however, find that planned caesarean sections for all breech babies improve outcome. The difference may rest in part on the skill of the doctors who delivered babies in different studies.)  Complete breech presentation is the next most favorable position, but these babies sometimes shift and become footling breeches during labour.  Footling and kneeling breeches have a higher risk of cord prolapse and head entrapment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Parity (medicine)|Parity]] \u2013 Parity refers to the number of times a woman has given birth before.  If a woman has given birth vaginally, her pelvis has \"proven\" it is big enough to allow a baby of that baby's size to pass through it. However, a head-down baby's head often molds (shifts its shape to fit the maternal pelvis) and so may present a smaller diameter than the same-size baby born breech.  Research on the issue has been contradictory as far as whether vaginal breech birth is safer when the mother has given birth before, or not.\n* Fetal size in relation to maternal [[pelvis|pelvic]] size \u2013 If the mother's pelvis is roomy and the baby is not large, this is favorable for vaginal breech delivery.  However, prenatal estimates of the size of the baby and the size of the pelvis are unreliable.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Hyperextension]] of the fetal [[head]] \u2013 this can be evaluated with ultrasound. Less than 5% of breech babies have their heads in the \"star-gazing\" position, face looking straight upwards and the back of the head resting against the back of the neck.  Caesarean delivery is absolutely necessary, because vaginal birth with the baby's head in this position confers a high risk of spinal cord trauma and death.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Fetal development|Maturity]] of the baby \u2013 Premature babies appear to be at higher risk of complications if delivered vaginally than if delivered by caesarean section.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* Progress of labor \u2013 A spontaneous, normally progressing, straightforward labor requiring no intervention is a favorable sign.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* Second [[twins]] \u2013 If a first twin is born head down and the second twin is breech, the chances are good that the second twin can have a safe breech birth.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kotaska A, Menticoglou S, Farine D | display-authors = etal | date = Jun 2009 | title = Vaginal delivery of breech presentation | url = | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol Can | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 557\u201366, 567\u201378 | doi=10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34221-9 | pmid = 19646324}} (reference is for entire section)</ref>\n\n==Management==\n[[File:Beckenendlage MRT.jpg|thumb|Breech birth position seen at MRI.]]\nAs in [[labour (childbirth)|labour]] with a baby in a normal head-down position, uterine contractions typically occur at regular intervals and gradually the [[cervix]] begins to thin and open.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |title=First stage |url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/first-stage-4909 |website=StratOG |accessdate=22 April 2016 |date=2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427204717/https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/first-stage-4909# |archive-date=2016-04-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the more common breech presentations, the baby's bottom (rather than feet or knees) is what is first to descend through the maternal [[pelvis]] and emerge from the vagina.<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" />\n\nAt the beginning of labour, the baby is generally in an [[wikt:oblique|oblique]] position, facing either the right or left side. The baby's bottom is the same size in the term baby as the baby's head.  Descent is thus as for the presenting fetal head and delay in descent is a cardinal sign of possible problems with the delivery of the head.\n\nIn order to begin the birth, descent of podalic pole along with compaction and internal rotation needs to occur.  This happens when the mother's [[pelvic floor]] muscles cause the baby to turn so that it can be born with one hip directly in front of the other.  At this point the baby is facing one of the mother's inner thighs.  Then, the shoulders follow the same path as the hips did.   At this time the baby usually turns to face the mother's back.   Next occurs external rotation, which is when the shoulders emerge as the baby's head enters the maternal pelvis.  The combination of maternal muscle tone and uterine contractions cause the baby's head to [[flexion|flex]], chin to chest.   Then the  back of the baby's head emerges and finally the [[face]].\n\nDue to the increased [[pressure]] during labour and birth, it is normal for the baby's leading hip to be bruised and [[genitalia]] to be [[Swelling (medical)|swollen]].

Due to this and other risks, babies in breech position are usually born by a planned caesarean section in developed countries.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/>\n\nCaesarean section reduces the risk of harm or death for the baby but does increase risk of harm to the mother compared with a vaginal delivery.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/> It is best if the baby is in a head down position so that they can be born vaginally with less risk of harm to both mother and baby. The next section is looking at [[External cephalic version]] or ECV which is a method that can help the baby turn from a breech position to a head down position.\n\nVaginal birth of a breech baby has its risks but caesarean sections are not always available or possible, a mother might arrive in hospital at a late stage of her labour or may choose not to have a caesarean section. In these cases, it is important that the clinical skills needed to deliver breech babies are not lost so that mothers and babies are as safe as possible.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/> Compared with developed countries, planned caesarean sections have not produced as good results in developing countries \u2013 it is suggested that this is due to more breech vaginal deliveries being performed by experienced, skilled practitioners in these settings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Twin breech ==\n[[File:Twin breech.gif|thumb|Twin breech (vertex and non-vertex twins) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellspan.org/getImage.ashx?id=161458|title=Twin Breech|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\nIn twin pregnancies, it is very common for one or both babies to be in the breech position. Most often twin babies do not have the chance to turn around because they are born prematurely. If both  babies are in the breech position and the mother has gone into labour early, a cesarean section may be the best option. About 30\u201340% of twin pregnancies result in only one baby being in the breech position. If this is the case, the babies can be born vaginally.<ref name=\"Delivery of Breech Second Twin\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/delivery-breech-second-twin|title=Delivery of Breech Second Twin|website=Healthline|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> After the first baby who is not in the breech position is delivered, the baby who is presented in the breech position may turn itself around, if this does not happen another procedure may performed called the breech extraction. The breech extraction is the procedure that involves the obstetrician grabbing the second twin's feet and pulling him/her into the birth canal. This will help with delivering the second twin vaginally.<ref name=\"Delivery of Breech Second Twin\"/> However, if the second twin is larger than the first, complications with delivering the second twin vaginally may arise and a cesarean section should be performed. At times, the first twin (the twin closest to the birth canal) can be in the breech position with the second twin being in the cephalic position (vertical). When this occurs, risks of complications are higher than normal. In particular, a serious complication known as [[Locked twins]]. This is when both babies interlock their chins during labour. When this happens a cesarean section should be performed immediately.\n\n===Turning the baby===\nTurning the baby, technically known as [[external cephalic version]] (ECV), is when the baby is turned by gently pressing the mother's abdomen to push the baby from a bottom first position, to a head first position.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> ECV does not always work, but it does improve the mother's chances of giving birth to her baby vaginally and avoiding a cesarean section. The World Health Organisation recommends that women should have a planned cesarean section only if an ECV has been tried and did not work.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last1=Conde-Agudelo|first1=A|title=Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery: RHL commentary (last revised: 8 September 2003)|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_childbirth/childbirth/breech/acaguide/en/|website=The WHO Reproductive Health Library|publisher=Geneva: World Health Organization|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWomen who have an ECV when they are 36\u201340 weeks pregnant are more likely to have a vaginal delivery and less likely to have a cesarean section than those who do not have an ECV.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Turning the baby before this time makes a head first birth more likely but ECV before the due date can increase the risk of early or premature birth which can cause problems to the baby.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThere are treatments that can be used which might affect the success of an ECV.

This period is characterized by frequent changes of presentations. The fetuses in breech presentation during this period have the same probability for breech and cephalic presentation at delivery.\n\nDuring the second period, lasting from the 25th to the 35th gestational week, the incidence of cephalic presentation increases, with a proportional decrease of breech presentation. The second period is characterized by a higher than random probability that the fetal presentation during this period will also be present at the time of delivery. The increase of this probability is gradual and identical for breech and cephalic presentations during this period.\n\nIn the third period, from the 36th gestational week onward, the incidence of cephalic and breech presentations remain stable, i.e. breech presentation around 3\u20134% and cephalic presentation approximately 95%.

If there is a delay in delivery, the brain can be damaged. Among full-term, head-down babies, cord prolapse is quite rare, occurring in 0.4 percent. Among frank breech babies the incidence is 0.5 percent,<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" /> among complete breeches 5 percent,<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" /> and among footling breeches 15 percent.<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" />\n\nHead entrapment is caused by the failure of the fetal head to negotiate the maternal midpelvis.  At full term, the fetal bitrochanteric diameter (the distance between the outer points of the hips) is about the same as the biparietal diameter (the transverse diameter of the skull)\u2014simply put the size of the hips are the same as the size of the head. The relatively larger buttocks dilate the cervix as effectively as the head does in the typical head-down presentation. In contrast, the relative head size of a [[preterm baby]] is greater than the fetal buttocks. If the baby is preterm, it may be possible for the baby's body to emerge while the cervix has not dilated enough for the head to emerge.\n\nBecause the umbilical cord\u2014the baby's oxygen supply\u2014is significantly compressed while the head is in the pelvis during a breech birth, it is important that the delivery of the aftercoming fetal head not be delayed.  If the arm is extended alongside the head, delivery will not occur. If this occurs, the ''[[L\u00f8vset's manoeuvre|L\u00f8vset manoeuvre]]'' may be employed, or the arm may be manually brought to a position in front of the chest.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tidy|first1=C|title=Breech Presentations |url=http://patient.info/doctor/breech-presentations|website=Patient|access-date=22 April 2016}}</ref> The L\u00f8vset manoeuvre involves rotating the fetal body by holding the fetal pelvis.  Twisting the body such that an arm trails behind the shoulder, it will tend to cross down over the face to a position where it can be reached by the obstetrician's finger, and brought to a position below the head. A similar rotation in the opposite direction is made to deliver the other arm. In order to present the smallest diameter (9.5&nbsp;cm) to the pelvis, the baby's head must be flexed (chin to chest). If the head is in a deflexed position, the risk of entrapment is increased.  Uterine contractions and maternal muscle tone encourage the head to flex.\n\n[[Oxygen deprivation]] may occur from either cord prolapse or prolonged compression of the [[umbilical cord|cord]] during birth, as in [[head entrapment]]. If [[oxygen deprivation]] is prolonged, it may cause permanent [[neurological]] damage (for instance, [[cerebral palsy]]) or [[death]]. It has been suggested that a fast vaginal delivery would mean the risk of stopping baby's oxygen supply is reduced.  However, there is not enough research to show this and a quick delivery might cause more harm to the baby than a conservative approach to the birth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Kulier|first2=R|last3=West|first3=HM|title=Expedited versus conservative approaches for vaginal delivery in breech presentation.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=21 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000082|pmid=26197303|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000082.pub3|pmc=6505640}}</ref>\n\n[[Injury]] to the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[Human skull|skull]] may occur due to the rapid passage of the baby's head through the mother's [[pelvis]]. This causes rapid decompression of the baby's head. In contrast, a baby going through labor in the head-down position usually experiences gradual molding (temporary reshaping of the skull) over the course of a few hours. This sudden compression and decompression in breech birth may cause no problems at all, but it can injure the brain. This injury is more likely in [[preterm]] babies. The fetal head may be controlled by a special two-handed grip call the Mariceau\u2013Smellie\u2013Veit manoeuvre or the elective application of forceps. This will be of value in controlling the rate of delivery of the head and reduce decompression. Related to potential head trauma, researchers have identified a relationship between breech birth and [[autism]].<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{cite journal | author = Bilder Deborah, Pinborough-Zimmerman Judith, Miller Judith, McMahon William | year = 2009 | title = Prenatal, Perinatal, and Neonatal Factors Associated With Autism Spectrum Disorders | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 123 | issue = 5| pages = 1293\u20131300 | doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0927}}</ref>\n\nSqueezing the baby's abdomen can damage internal organs.

With the majority of breech babies being delivered by cesarean section there is more risk that birth attendants will lose their skills in delivering breech babies and therefore increase the risk of harm to the baby during a vaginal delivery.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Kotaska|first1=A|last2=Menticoglou|first2=S|last3=Gagnon|first3=R|last4=Farine|first4=D|last5=Basso|first5=M|last6=Bos|first6=H|last7=Delisle|first7=MF|last8=Grabowska|first8=K|last9=Hudon|first9=L|last10=Mundle|first10=W|last11=Murphy-Kaulbeck|first11=L|last12=Ouellet|first12=A|last13=Pressey|first13=T|last14=Roggensack|first14=A|last15=Maternal Fetal Medicine|first15=Committee|last16=Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of|first16=Canada|title=Vaginal delivery of breech presentation.|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada|date=June 2009|volume=31|issue=6|pages=557\u201366, 567\u201378|pmid=19646324|doi=10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34221-9}}</ref>\n* Type of breech presentation \u2013 the frank breech has the most favorable outcomes in vaginal birth, with many studies suggesting no difference in outcome compared to head down babies.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twG4F3gjA5YC|title=Anesthetic and Obstetric Management of High-Risk Pregnancy|last=Datta|first=Sanjay|date=2004-01-09|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780387004433|language=en}}</ref> (Some studies, however, find that planned caesarean sections for all breech babies improve outcome. The difference may rest in part on the skill of the doctors who delivered babies in different studies.)  Complete breech presentation is the next most favorable position, but these babies sometimes shift and become footling breeches during labour.  Footling and kneeling breeches have a higher risk of cord prolapse and head entrapment.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Parity (medicine)|Parity]] \u2013 Parity refers to the number of times a woman has given birth before.  If a woman has given birth vaginally, her pelvis has \"proven\" it is big enough to allow a baby of that baby's size to pass through it. However, a head-down baby's head often molds (shifts its shape to fit the maternal pelvis) and so may present a smaller diameter than the same-size baby born breech.  Research on the issue has been contradictory as far as whether vaginal breech birth is safer when the mother has given birth before, or not.\n* Fetal size in relation to maternal [[pelvis|pelvic]] size \u2013 If the mother's pelvis is roomy and the baby is not large, this is favorable for vaginal breech delivery.  However, prenatal estimates of the size of the baby and the size of the pelvis are unreliable.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Hyperextension]] of the fetal [[head]] \u2013 this can be evaluated with ultrasound. Less than 5% of breech babies have their heads in the \"star-gazing\" position, face looking straight upwards and the back of the head resting against the back of the neck.  Caesarean delivery is absolutely necessary, because vaginal birth with the baby's head in this position confers a high risk of spinal cord trauma and death.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Fetal development|Maturity]] of the baby \u2013 Premature babies appear to be at higher risk of complications if delivered vaginally than if delivered by caesarean section.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* Progress of labor \u2013 A spontaneous, normally progressing, straightforward labor requiring no intervention is a favorable sign.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* Second [[twins]] \u2013 If a first twin is born head down and the second twin is breech, the chances are good that the second twin can have a safe breech birth.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kotaska A, Menticoglou S, Farine D | display-authors = etal | date = Jun 2009 | title = Vaginal delivery of breech presentation | url = | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol Can | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 557\u201366, 567\u201378 | doi=10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34221-9 | pmid = 19646324}} (reference is for entire section)</ref>\n\n==Management==\n[[File:Beckenendlage MRT.jpg|thumb|Breech birth position seen at MRI.]]\nAs in [[labour (childbirth)|labour]] with a baby in a normal head-down position, uterine contractions typically occur at regular intervals and gradually the [[cervix]] begins to thin and open.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |title=First stage |url=https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/first-stage-4909 |website=StratOG |accessdate=22 April 2016 |date=2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427204717/https://stratog.rcog.org.uk/tutorial/easi-resource/first-stage-4909# |archive-date=2016-04-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the more common breech presentations, the baby's bottom (rather than feet or knees) is what is first to descend through the maternal [[pelvis]] and emerge from the vagina.<ref name=\"PatientInfoProlapsedCord\" />\n\nAt the beginning of labour, the baby is generally in an [[wikt:oblique|oblique]] position, facing either the right or left side. The baby's bottom is the same size in the term baby as the baby's head.  Descent is thus as for the presenting fetal head and delay in descent is a cardinal sign of possible problems with the delivery of the head.\n\nIn order to begin the birth, descent of podalic pole along with compaction and internal rotation needs to occur.  This happens when the mother's [[pelvic floor]] muscles cause the baby to turn so that it can be born with one hip directly in front of the other.  At this point the baby is facing one of the mother's inner thighs.  Then, the shoulders follow the same path as the hips did.   At this time the baby usually turns to face the mother's back.   Next occurs external rotation, which is when the shoulders emerge as the baby's head enters the maternal pelvis.  The combination of maternal muscle tone and uterine contractions cause the baby's head to [[flexion|flex]], chin to chest.   Then the  back of the baby's head emerges and finally the [[face]].\n\nDue to the increased [[pressure]] during labour and birth, it is normal for the baby's leading hip to be bruised and [[genitalia]] to be [[Swelling (medical)|swollen]]. Babies who assumed the frank breech position in utero may continue to hold their legs in this position for some days after birth.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McClain|first1=L|title=Will my newborn be different? \u2013 Better Birth Blog|url=http://www.betterbirthblog.org/breech/breech-faq/will-my-newborn-be-different/|website=Better Birth Blog|accessdate=18 March 2016|date=2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cesarean or vaginal delivery===\nWhen a baby is born bottom first there is more risk that the birth will not be straight forward and that the baby could be harmed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=EK|last2=Hofmeyr|first2=GJ|last3=Dowswell|first3=T|title=External cephalic version for breech presentation before term.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 July 2015|volume=7|pages=CD000084|pmid=26222245|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000084.pub3}}</ref> For example, when the baby's head passes through the mother's pelvis the umbilical cord can be compressed which prevents delivery of oxygenated blood to the baby. Due to this and other risks, babies in breech position are usually born by a planned caesarean section in developed countries.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/>\n\nCaesarean section reduces the risk of harm or death for the baby but does increase risk of harm to the mother compared with a vaginal delivery.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/> It is best if the baby is in a head down position so that they can be born vaginally with less risk of harm to both mother and baby. The next section is looking at [[External cephalic version]] or ECV which is a method that can help the baby turn from a breech position to a head down position.\n\nVaginal birth of a breech baby has its risks but caesarean sections are not always available or possible, a mother might arrive in hospital at a late stage of her labour or may choose not to have a caesarean section. In these cases, it is important that the clinical skills needed to deliver breech babies are not lost so that mothers and babies are as safe as possible.<ref name=\"Hof2015\"/> Compared with developed countries, planned caesarean sections have not produced as good results in developing countries \u2013 it is suggested that this is due to more breech vaginal deliveries being performed by experienced, skilled practitioners in these settings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Twin breech ==\n[[File:Twin breech.gif|thumb|Twin breech (vertex and non-vertex twins) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellspan.org/getImage.ashx?id=161458|title=Twin Breech|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\nIn twin pregnancies, it is very common for one or both babies to be in the breech position. Most often twin babies do not have the chance to turn around because they are born prematurely. If both  babies are in the breech position and the mother has gone into labour early, a cesarean section may be the best option. About 30\u201340% of twin pregnancies result in only one baby being in the breech position. If this is the case, the babies can be born vaginally.<ref name=\"Delivery of Breech Second Twin\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/delivery-breech-second-twin|title=Delivery of Breech Second Twin|website=Healthline|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> After the first baby who is not in the breech position is delivered, the baby who is presented in the breech position may turn itself around, if this does not happen another procedure may performed called the breech extraction. The breech extraction is the procedure that involves the obstetrician grabbing the second twin's feet and pulling him/her into the birth canal. This will help with delivering the second twin vaginally.<ref name=\"Delivery of Breech Second Twin\"/> However, if the second twin is larger than the first, complications with delivering the second twin vaginally may arise and a cesarean section should be performed. At times, the first twin (the twin closest to the birth canal) can be in the breech position with the second twin being in the cephalic position (vertical). When this occurs, risks of complications are higher than normal. In particular, a serious complication known as [[Locked twins]]. This is when both babies interlock their chins during labour. When this happens a cesarean section should be performed immediately.\n\n===Turning the baby===\nTurning the baby, technically known as [[external cephalic version]] (ECV), is when the baby is turned by gently pressing the mother's abdomen to push the baby from a bottom first position, to a head first position.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> ECV does not always work, but it does improve the mother's chances of giving birth to her baby vaginally and avoiding a cesarean section. The World Health Organisation recommends that women should have a planned cesarean section only if an ECV has been tried and did not work.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last1=Conde-Agudelo|first1=A|title=Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery: RHL commentary (last revised: 8 September 2003)|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_childbirth/childbirth/breech/acaguide/en/|website=The WHO Reproductive Health Library|publisher=Geneva: World Health Organization|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWomen who have an ECV when they are 36\u201340 weeks pregnant are more likely to have a vaginal delivery and less likely to have a cesarean section than those who do not have an ECV.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Turning the baby before this time makes a head first birth more likely but ECV before the due date can increase the risk of early or premature birth which can cause problems to the baby.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThere are treatments that can be used which might affect the success of an ECV. Drugs called beta-stimulant tocolytics help the woman's muscles to relax so that the pressure during the ECV does not have to be so great. Giving the woman these drugs before the ECV improves the chances of her having a vaginal delivery because the baby is more likely to turn and stay head down.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{cite journal|last1=Cluver|first1=C|last2=Gyte|first2=GM|last3=Sinclair|first3=M|last4=Dowswell|first4=T|last5=Hofmeyr|first5=GJ|title=Interventions for helping to turn term breech babies to head first presentation when using external cephalic version.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 February 2015|volume=2|pages=CD000184|pmid=25674710|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000184.pub4}}</ref> Other treatments such as using sound, pain relief drugs such as epidural, increasing the fluid around the baby and increasing the amount of fluids to the woman before the ECV could all effect its success but there is not enough research to make this clear.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nTurning techniques mothers can do at home are referred to as \"spontaneous cephalic version\" (SCV), this is when the baby can turn without any medical assistance.<ref name=\"babycentre.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/x1053586/how-can-i-turn-my-breech-baby-naturally|title=How can I turn my breech baby naturally?|website=BabyCentre|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref> Some of these techniques include: a knee-to-chest position, the breech tilt, and [[moxibustion]], these can be performed after the mother is 34 weeks pregnant.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} There is limited evidence that these techniques have any effect.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Notable cases ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Chesa Boudin]]<ref name=\"Boudin\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/09/us/from-a-radical-background-a-rhodes-scholar-emerges.html | title=From a Radical Background, A Rhodes Scholar Emerges | work=New York Times | date=9 December 2002 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Wilgoren, Jodi}}</ref>\n* [[Jordan Brady]]<ref name=\"Brady\">{{cite web | url=http://humorcode.com/i-am-comic-director-jordan-brady-on-spit-takes-and-the-downside-of-supportive-audiences | title='I Am Comic' Director Jordan Brady on Spit Takes and the Downside of Supportive Audiences | publisher=The Humor Code | work=Interview | accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Becky Garrison]]<ref name=\"Garrison\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ax9i4ExsVcUC&lpg=PA133&dq=%22was%20born%20breech%22&pg=PA133#v=onepage&q=%22was%20born%20breech%22&f=false | title=The New Atheist Crusaders and Their Unholy Grail: The Misguided Quest to Destroy Your Faith | author=Garrison, Becky | publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc | year=1 Jan 2008 | pages=133}}</ref>\n* [[Billy Joel]]<ref name=\"Joel\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/billy-joel-on-not-working-and-not-giving-up-drinking.html | title=Billy Joel on not working, not giving up drinking and not caring what Elton John says about any of it | publisher=New York Times Magazine | date=26 May 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2015 | author=Andrew Goldman | pages=34}} Joel attributes the need for double hip replacement surgery to \"probably being born with dysplasia.\" He explains that he was a breech baby and that forceps may have displaced his hips.</ref>\n* [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite web | url=http://thesheetnews.com/2010/02/26/great-balls-of-wax/ | title=Great balls of wax  | date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=McKennain, Mike}} Allegedly said, \"I was born feet first, and I've been jumpin' ever since.\"</ref>\n* [[Bret Michaels]]<ref name=\"Michaels\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bretmichaels.com/site-news/news2/music-for-your-soul-april-15-2012 | title=Music for your soul | publisher=Bret Michaels | work=His website | date=15 April 2012 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Ellis, Christine}}</ref>\n* [[Nero]]<ref name=\"Nero\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqDXq3voR_gC&lpg=PA496&ots=QP_3Dv7JAF&dq=%22was%20born%20breech%22%20nero&pg=PA496#v=onepage&q=%22was%20born%20breech%22%20nero&f=false | title=Rome and Her Monuments: Essays on the City and Literature of Rome in Honor of Katherine A.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

RDA is higher than EAR so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy equals 2.6{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. RDA for lactation equals 2.8 \u03bcg/day. For infants up to 12 months the adequate intake (AI) is 0.4\u20130.5{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. (AIs are established when there is insufficient information to determine EARs and RDAs.) For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 0.9 to 1.8{{nbsp}}\u03bcg/day. Because 10 to 30 percent of older people may be unable to effectively absorb vitamin B{{sub|12}} naturally occurring in foods, it is advisable for those older than 50 years to meet their RDA mainly by consuming foods fortified with vitamin B{{sub|12}} or a supplement containing vitamin B{{sub|12}}. As for safety, [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (known as ULs) are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of vitamin B{{sub|12}} there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses.

The central metal ion is [[cobalt]]. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a [[dimethylbenzimidazole]] group. The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>).

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur.

Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]].

The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. The vitamin exists as a family of [[vitamer]]s defined as a number of chemical compounds having a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system. [[Adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body, the first in mitochondria and the second in cell cytosol. AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location.\n\n[[Cyanocobalamin]] is a manufactured form with a cyano ([[cyanide]]) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

The central metal ion is [[cobalt]]. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a [[dimethylbenzimidazole]] group. The sixth coordination site, the [[reactive center]], is variable, being a [[Cyanide|cyano group]] (\u2013CN), a [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2013OH), a [[methyl]] group (\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>) or a 5\u2032-deoxy[[Adenosine|adenosyl]] group (here the C5\u2032 atom of the deoxyribose forms the [[organocobalt chemistry|covalent bond with cobalt]] respectively, to yield the four [[vitamer]]s (forms) of B<sub>12</sub>). Historically, the covalent C-Co bond is one of the first examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology.

All of the substrate cobalt-corrin molecules from which B<sub>12</sub> is made must be synthesized by bacteria. After this synthesis is complete, the human body has the ability to convert cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin to an active form, by means of enzymatically removing certain prosthetic chemical groups from the cobalt atom and replacing them with others.\n[[File:Cobalamin-general-structure-color.png|thumb|The structures of the four most common vitamers of cobalamin, together with some synonyms. The structure of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, which forms the R group of adensoylcobalamin is also shown.]]\n\n===Vitamers===\nThe four vitamers of B<sub>12</sub> (see figure) are all deeply red-colored crystals due to the color of the cobalt-corrin complex.\n\n*'''[[Cyanocobalamin]]''' is one form of B<sub>12</sub> because it can be metabolized in the body to an active [[coenzyme]] form.<ref name=lpi/> The cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> does not occur in nature normally, but is a byproduct of the fact that other forms of B<sub>12</sub> are avid binders of cyanide (\u2013CN) which they pick up in the process of [[activated charcoal]] purification of the vitamin after it is made by bacteria in the commercial process. Since the cyanocobalamin form of B<sub>12</sub> is easy to crystallize and is not sensitive to air-oxidation, it is typically used as a form of B<sub>12</sub> for food fortification, in many common multivitamins and as a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> dietary supplement. \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub> commonly encountered in pharmacology, but is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. This is the form of B<sub>12</sub> produced by bacteria, and which is converted to cyanocobalamin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for [[cyanide]] ions and has been used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer retention times in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) and '''[[methylcobalamin]]''' (MeB<sub>12</sub> or MeCbl) are the two enzymatically active cofactor forms of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occur in the body. Most of the body's reserves are stored as adoB<sub>12</sub> in the liver. This is converted to the methylcobalamin form as needed.\n\nA review of what is reported in the literature about cobalamin chemistry, transport, and processing suggests that there is unlikely to be any advantage to the use of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin for treatment of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency over using cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin except possibly in very rare circumstances in which an inborn metabolic disorder reduces the efficiency of the conversion of cyanocobalamin to MeCbl or AdoCbl. The use of intramuscular hydroxocobalamin has been suggested in these cases. For the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is the required form. Due to its excellent shelf-life and stability, cyanocobalamin is still considered the best choice for oral administration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Obeid R, Fedosov SN, Nexo E | title = Cobalamin coenzyme forms are not likely to be superior to cyano- and hydroxyl-cobalamin in prevention or treatment of cobalamin deficiency | journal = Molecular Nutrition & Food Research | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1364\u201372 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25820384 | pmc = 4692085 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.201500019 }}</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[File:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|300px|[[Metabolism]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is seen at bottom left.]]\n\n===Coenzyme function===\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> functions as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Banerjee R, Ragsdale SW | title = The many faces of vitamin B12: catalysis by cobalamin-dependent enzymes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 72 | pages = 209\u201347 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 14527323 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161828 }}</ref> Three types of enzymes:\n\n# [[Isomerase]]s\n#: Rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine.

For example, MMA is elevated in 90\u201398% of patients with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; 20\u201325% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of MMA, yet 25\u201333% of them do not have B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter.

The culture medium for LLD required liver extract. Shorb knew that the same liver extract was used to treat pernicious anemia (her father-in-law had died from the disease), and concluded that LLD could be developed as an assay method to identify the active compound. While at the University of Maryland she received a small grant from [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and in collaboration with [[Karl Folkers]] from that company, developed the LLD assay.

Noted that the [[Crimean Tatars]] suffered cruel injustice in Soviet times, together with the other peoples, including the [[Russian people]]. After the Crimean Tatars have returned to their land, new solutions for a complete rehabilitation of the Crimean Tatar people are required. He proposed three equal official languages for Crimea - [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]].\n\nThe President stressed that in the heart of the Crimean people, Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia. [[Bolshevik]]s included a significant amount of the historical Russian southern land into the [[Ukrainian SSR]] without taking into account the national composition of its population. Further, in 1954, the Crimea and Sevastopol in the Ukrainian SSR passed. This decision was taken in violation of constitutional norms, behind the scenes, in a totalitarian state residents of Crimea and Sevastopol nothing asked. That decision was seen as a formality, since the territory transferred within the same country.\n\nPutin condemned the West\u2019s reaction to the events in the Crimea and sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian politicians. Russian President expressed gratitude to the people of [[China]], praised the restraint of [[India]]. Appealed to the U.S. freedom-loving people, stressing that freedom of the Crimean population is the same value. Referring to the fact that not all allies sympathized with [[Germany]] in 1989, it merged with the [[German Democratic Republic]], Putin said that while the USSR supported the Germans sincere desire for national unity. The President expressed confidence that German citizens support the aspirations of the Russian world to restore the unity of 'Crimea will remain Russian and Ukrainian and [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]]. It will be home to the representatives of all the peoples living there. But he will never [[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]]'.\n\nPutin assured that Russia will not seek confrontation with the West and the East, and stressed that Russia and Ukraine \u2014 are one people. Ukraine will continue to live millions of Russian citizens, which means that Russia will always defend their interests.\n\nPutin\u2019s speech lasted 45&nbsp;minutes. During the speech, Putin used the term \"natsional-predateli\" (\u201cnational-traitors\u201d) which is a [[calque]] from the German term ''Nationalverr\u00e4ter''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=r-AgnPTl2i4C&pg=PA214 Felicity J.

Noted that the [[Crimean Tatars]] suffered cruel injustice in Soviet times, together with the other peoples, including the [[Russian people]]. After the Crimean Tatars have returned to their land, new solutions for a complete rehabilitation of the Crimean Tatar people are required. He proposed three equal official languages for Crimea - [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]].\n\nThe President stressed that in the heart of the Crimean people, Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia. [[Bolshevik]]s included a significant amount of the historical Russian southern land into the [[Ukrainian SSR]] without taking into account the national composition of its population. Further, in 1954, the Crimea and Sevastopol in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] passed. This decision was taken in violation of constitutional norms, behind the scenes, in a totalitarian state residents of Crimea and Sevastopol nothing asked. That decision was seen as a formality, since the territory transferred within the same country.\n\nPutin condemned the West\u2019s reaction to the events in the Crimea and sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian politicians. Russian President expressed gratitude to the people of [[China]], praised the restraint of [[India]]. Appealed to the U.S. freedom-loving people, stressing that freedom of the Crimean population is the same value. Referring to the fact that not all allies sympathized with [[Germany]] in 1989, it merged with the [[German Democratic Republic]], Putin said that while the USSR supported the Germans sincere desire for national unity. The President expressed confidence that German citizens support the aspirations of the Russian world to restore the unity of 'Crimea will remain Russian and Ukrainian and [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]]. It will be home to the representatives of all the peoples living there. But he will never [[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]]'.\n\nPutin assured that Russia will not seek confrontation with the West and the East, and stressed that Russia and Ukraine \u2014 are one people. Ukraine will continue to live millions of Russian citizens, which means that Russia will always defend their interests.\n\nPutin\u2019s speech lasted 45&nbsp;minutes. During the speech, Putin used the term \"natsional-predateli\" (\u201cnational-traitors\u201d) which is a [[calque]] from the German term ''Nationalverr\u00e4ter''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=r-AgnPTl2i4C&pg=PA214 Felicity J.
