At any time during any of these stages, if a player reaches the target score (usually 121), play ends immediately with that player being the winner of the game. This can even happen during the deal, since the dealer scores if a jack is cut as the starter.\n\n===Deal===\nThe players [[cut (cards)|cut]] for first deal, and the person who cuts the lowest card deals. The dealer [[shuffle]]s and deals five or six cards to each player, depending on the number of players. For two players, each is dealt six cards; for three or four players, each is dealt five cards. In the case of three players, a single card is dealt face down in the centre of the table to start the crib. Once the cards have been dealt, each player chooses four cards to retain, then discards the other one or two face-down to form the \"crib\" (also called the box), which will be used later by the dealer.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Parlett\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David Parlett\n | title = The Penguin Book of Card Games\n | date = October 1987\n | publisher = Treasure Press\n | isbn = 1-85051-221-3\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/penguinbookofcar0000parl\n }}</ref> At this point, each player's hand and the crib will contain exactly four cards.

The cards are not laid in the centre of the table as, at the end of the \"play\", each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.\n\nPlayers score points during the play as follows:\n*15 \u2013 For causing the count to reach exactly 15 a player scores two points, then play continues.\n*Pair \u2013 Completing a pair (two of a kind) scores two points. \n**Three of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points.\n**Four of a kind is 6 different pairs, or 12 points. \n*A [[run (cards)|run]] of three or more cards (consecutively played, but not necessarily in order) scores the number of cards in the run.\n\nIf a player cannot play without causing the count to exceed 31, they call \"Go\". Continuing with the player on their left, the other player(s) continue(s) the play until no one can play without the count exceeding 31. A player is obliged to play a card unless there is no card in their  hand that can be played without the count exceeding 31 (one cannot voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to play, the player who played the last card scores one point if the count is still under 31 and two if it is exactly 31. The count is then reset to zero and those players with cards remaining in their hands repeat the process starting with the player to the left of the player who played the last card. When all players have played all of their cards the game proceeds to the \"show\".\n\nPlayers choose the order in which to lay their cards in order to maximize their scores; experienced players refer to this as either good or poor \"pegging\" or \"pegsmanship\". If one player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins. When the scores are level during a game, the players' pegs will be side by side, and it is thought that this gave rise to the phrase \"level pegging\".<ref>Oxford Dictionaries, OxfordWords blog http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/11/popular-idioms-explained/ extracted 31 Oct 2014</ref>\n\n===Show===\nOnce the play is complete, each player in turn, starting with the player on the left of the dealer, displays their own hand on the table and scores points based on its content ''in conjunction with the starter card''. Points are scored for:\n*Combinations of cards totalling fifteen\n*Runs\n*Pairs (Multiple pairs are scored pair by pair but may be referred to as three or four of a kind.) \n*[[flush (cards)|Flush]] (A four-card flush scores four and cannot include the starter card; a five-card flush scores five.)\n*Having a jack of the same suit as the starter card (\"one for his nob [or ''nobs'' or ''nibs'']\", sometimes called the \"right\" jack)\n\nThe dealer scores their hand last and then turns the cards in the crib face up. These cards are then scored by the dealer as an additional hand, also in conjunction with the starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand, the crib cannot score a four-card flush, but it can score a five-card flush with the starter.\n\nAll scores from 0 to 29 are possible, with the exception of 19, 25, 26 and 27.<ref name=\"lumetta\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/~steve/humor/cribbage.html\n|title= Amusing Cribbage Facts\n|accessdate= 2008-03-03\n|author= Steven S.

The match points are scored on the cribbage board using the holes reserved for match points. On a spiral board, these are often at the bottom of the board in a line with 5 or 7 holes. On a conventional board, they are often in the middle of the board or at the top or bottom.\n\nIn a two-player game of cribbage, a player scores one match point for winning a game. Their opponent will start as dealer in the next game. If a player [[Lourche|lurches]] (British) or skunks (US) their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent scores 91 points), that player wins two match points for that game. If a player double skunks their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent reaches 61), they score three or four match points for the game, depending on local convention.<ref name=\"doubleskunk\">{{cite web\n|url= http://cribbagecorner.com/cribbage-rules-winning\n|title= Cribbage rules \u2013 winning the game\n|accessdate= 2015-02-23\n|author= Cribbage Corner\n}}</ref> If a player triple skunks their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent reaches 31 points), they automatically win the match.

Two pegs are used in a [[leapfrog]] fashion, so that if a player loses track during the count one peg still marks the previous score. Some boards have a \"game counter\" with many additional holes for use with a third peg to count the games won by each side.\n\nThere are several designs of crib board:\n*The classic design is a flat wooden board approximately 250\u2013300&nbsp;mm (10\u201312&nbsp;in) by 70\u201380&nbsp;mm (3\u20134&nbsp;in) and 10\u201320&nbsp;mm (0.4\u20130.8&nbsp;in) deep. There are two sets of 60 holes (30 'out' and 30 'back') divided into 5 point sections. A ''pegging-out'' hole in the middle at each end allows the board to be used in either direction. One player or team scores on one set of 60 holes and the other player or team scores on the second set. Different arrangements are made for three player games.\n*A relatively old design is that of an equilateral triangle with two rows of forty holes on each side. These boards did not generally include extra ''pegging-out'' holes or holes to count games.\n*A newer design has three or four rows of 120 holes in a \"paperclip\" shape (with a ''pegging-out'' hole at the end) and is often brightly coloured. It is best suited to games played to 121, though it can also be used for 61-point games.\n*A tournament long board is used in sanctioned tournaments in the [[American Cribbage Congress]] and consists of four rows of 60 pegs (two rows for each player), no number markings or five point segments, and only a mark indicating the skunk line.  Movement around the board starts on the outside and ends on the inside.  Players start and end in the same hole.\n*Another common variation is based on features of the highest-scoring cribbage hand. The board takes the form of the number 29 (the highest possible score), with the pegging rows following the contour of the numbers \"2\" and \"9\". The design can sometimes include a background image of three fives and a jack, with the fourth five offset\u2014the \"perfect hand\" giving that score. The count being 8 combinations of 15 for 16 points, 6 pairs of 2 for 12 points and a matching \"nobs\" jack (matching the cut card) for 1 totaling 29.\n\nEach of the four 30-point divisions of the cribbage board (1\u201330, 31\u201360, 61\u201390, and 91\u2013120) is colloquially called a \"street\".  Being at 15 points would be on first street, being at 59 points would be on second street, etc.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Card game]]\n*[[Cribbage statistics]]\n*[[Cribbage Solitaire]] and [[Cribbage Square Solitaire]], two [[solitaire]] card games based on Cribbage\n*[[Hounds and Jackals]], an Ancient Egyptian game, which uses a similar board\n*[[Kings Cribbage]], a game with cribbage hands being constructed crossword-style\n*[[Pub games]]\n*[[American Cribbage Congress]], sanctioning body for cribbage clubs and tournaments\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |first=John |last=Scarne |year=1965 |title=Scarne on Card Games |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-43603-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/scarneoncardgame00john/page/395 395\u2013404] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/scarneoncardgame00john/page/395 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Joe |last=Wergin |year=1980 |title=Win at Cribbage |publisher=Oldcastle Books |isbn=0-948353-97-X\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Cribbage}}\n* [http://www.cribbage.org/ American Cribbage Congress]\n\n{{Non trick-taking card games}}\n\n[[Category:17th-century card games]]\n[[Category:Cribbage]]\n[[Category:Adding games]]\n[[Category:Two-player card games]]\n[[Category:Four-player card games]]\n[[Category:Pub games]]\n[[Category:English card games]]\n[[Category:Matching games]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the pocket billiards game of the same name|Cribbage (pool)}}\n{{worldview|date=August 2019}}\n{{Infobox card game\n |title = Cribbage\n |subtitle = \n |image_link = Travel Cribbage Board (38669697446).jpg\n |image_caption = Cribbage being played with a travel-sized scoring board\n |Family = [[Card game#Matching games|Matching]]\n |alt_names = Crib\n |type = \n |players = 2 (''variations for 3\u20136'')\n |play = Clockwise\n |num_cards = 52\n |deck = [[Standard 52-card deck]]\n |card_rank = K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 A\n |origin = England\n |related = [[Noddy (card game)|Noddy]]\n |playing_time = 15\u201330 min.\n |random_chance = \n |skills = Strategy, tactics, counting\n |footnotes =\n}}\n\n'''Cribbage''', or '''crib''', is a [[card game]] traditionally for two players, but commonly played with three, four or more, that involves playing and grouping [[playing cards|cards]] in combinations which gain points.

At any time during any of these stages, if a player reaches the target score (usually 121), play ends immediately with that player being the winner of the game. This can even happen during the deal, since the dealer scores if a jack is cut as the starter.\n\n===Deal===\nThe players [[cut (cards)|cut]] for first deal, and the person who cuts the lowest card deals. The dealer [[shuffle]]s and deals five or six cards to each player, depending on the number of players. For two players, each is dealt six cards; for three or four players, each is dealt five cards. In the case of three players, a single card is dealt face down in the centre of the table to start the crib. Once the cards have been dealt, each player chooses four cards to retain, then discards the other one or two face-down to form the \"crib\" (also called the box), which will be used later by the dealer.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Parlett\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David Parlett\n | title = The Penguin Book of Card Games\n | date = October 1987\n | publisher = Treasure Press\n | isbn = 1-85051-221-3\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/penguinbookofcar0000parl\n }}</ref> At this point, each player's hand and the crib will contain exactly four cards. The player on the dealer's left cuts the remaining deck, and the dealer reveals the top card, called the \"starter\" or the \"cut\".<ref name=\"mechanics\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.cribbage.org/rules/rule1.asp\n|title= The Mechanics of Playing Cribbage\n|accessdate= 2008-03-01\n|date= 2004-10-01\n|publisher= The American Cribbage Congress\n}}</ref> If this card is a [[jack (playing card)|jack]], the dealer scores two points for \"his heels\" or \"his nibs\".\n\n===Play===\nStarting with the player on the dealer's left, the players each in turn lay one card face up on the table in front of them, stating the count\u2014that is, the cumulative value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says \"five\", the next lays a six and says \"eleven\", and so on)\u2014without the count going above 31. The cards are not laid in the centre of the table as, at the end of the \"play\", each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.\n\nPlayers score points during the play as follows:\n*15 \u2013 For causing the count to reach exactly 15 a player scores two points, then play continues.\n*Pair \u2013 Completing a pair (two of a kind) scores two points. \n**Three of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points.\n**Four of a kind is 6 different pairs, or 12 points. \n*A [[run (cards)|run]] of three or more cards (consecutively played, but not necessarily in order) scores the number of cards in the run.\n\nIf a player cannot play without causing the count to exceed 31, they call \"Go\". Continuing with the player on their left, the other player(s) continue(s) the play until no one can play without the count exceeding 31. A player is obliged to play a card unless there is no card in their  hand that can be played without the count exceeding 31 (one cannot voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to play, the player who played the last card scores one point if the count is still under 31 and two if it is exactly 31. The count is then reset to zero and those players with cards remaining in their hands repeat the process starting with the player to the left of the player who played the last card. When all players have played all of their cards the game proceeds to the \"show\".\n\nPlayers choose the order in which to lay their cards in order to maximize their scores; experienced players refer to this as either good or poor \"pegging\" or \"pegsmanship\". If one player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins. When the scores are level during a game, the players' pegs will be side by side, and it is thought that this gave rise to the phrase \"level pegging\".<ref>Oxford Dictionaries, OxfordWords blog http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/11/popular-idioms-explained/ extracted 31 Oct 2014</ref>\n\n===Show===\nOnce the play is complete, each player in turn, starting with the player on the left of the dealer, displays their own hand on the table and scores points based on its content ''in conjunction with the starter card''. Points are scored for:\n*Combinations of cards totalling fifteen\n*Runs\n*Pairs (Multiple pairs are scored pair by pair but may be referred to as three or four of a kind.) \n*[[flush (cards)|Flush]] (A four-card flush scores four and cannot include the starter card; a five-card flush scores five.)\n*Having a jack of the same suit as the starter card (\"one for his nob [or ''nobs'' or ''nibs'']\", sometimes called the \"right\" jack)\n\nThe dealer scores their hand last and then turns the cards in the crib face up. These cards are then scored by the dealer as an additional hand, also in conjunction with the starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand, the crib cannot score a four-card flush, but it can score a five-card flush with the starter.\n\nAll scores from 0 to 29 are possible, with the exception of 19, 25, 26 and 27.<ref name=\"lumetta\">{{cite web\n|url= http://www.crhc.uiuc.edu/~steve/humor/cribbage.html\n|title= Amusing Cribbage Facts\n|accessdate= 2008-03-03\n|author= Steven S.

The match points are scored on the cribbage board using the holes reserved for match points. On a spiral board, these are often at the bottom of the board in a line with 5 or 7 holes. On a conventional board, they are often in the middle of the board or at the top or bottom.\n\nIn a two-player game of cribbage, a player scores one match point for winning a game. Their opponent will start as dealer in the next game. If a player [[Lourche|lurches]] (British) or skunks (US) their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent scores 91 points), that player wins two match points for that game. If a player double skunks their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent reaches 61), they score three or four match points for the game, depending on local convention.<ref name=\"doubleskunk\">{{cite web\n|url= http://cribbagecorner.com/cribbage-rules-winning\n|title= Cribbage rules \u2013 winning the game\n|accessdate= 2015-02-23\n|author= Cribbage Corner\n}}</ref> If a player triple skunks their opponent (reaches 121 points before their opponent reaches 31 points), they automatically win the match.

Two pegs are used in a [[leapfrog]] fashion, so that if a player loses track during the count one peg still marks the previous score. Some boards have a \"game counter\" with many additional holes for use with a third peg to count the games won by each side.\n\nThere are several designs of crib board:\n*The classic design is a flat wooden board approximately 250\u2013300&nbsp;mm (10\u201312&nbsp;in) by 70\u201380&nbsp;mm (3\u20134&nbsp;in) and 10\u201320&nbsp;mm (0.4\u20130.8&nbsp;in) deep. There are two sets of 60 holes (30 'out' and 30 'back') divided into 5 point sections. A ''pegging-out'' hole in the middle at each end allows the board to be used in either direction. One player or team scores on one set of 60 holes and the other player or team scores on the second set. Different arrangements are made for three player games.\n*A relatively old design is that of an equilateral triangle with two rows of forty holes on each side. These boards did not generally include extra ''pegging-out'' holes or holes to count games.\n*A newer design has three or four rows of 120 holes in a \"paperclip\" shape (with a ''pegging-out'' hole at the end) and is often brightly coloured. It is best suited to games played to 121, though it can also be used for 61-point games.\n*A tournament long board is used in sanctioned tournaments in the [[American Cribbage Congress]] and consists of four rows of 60 pegs (two rows for each player), no number markings or five point segments, and only a mark indicating the skunk line.  Movement around the board starts on the outside and ends on the inside.  Players start and end in the same hole.\n*Another common variation is based on features of the highest-scoring cribbage hand. The board takes the form of the number 29 (the highest possible score), with the pegging rows following the contour of the numbers \"2\" and \"9\". The design can sometimes include a background image of three fives and a jack, with the fourth five offset\u2014the \"perfect hand\" giving that score. The count being 8 combinations of 15 for 16 points, 6 pairs of 2 for 12 points and a matching \"nobs\" jack (matching the cut card) for 1 totaling 29.\n\nEach of the four 30-point divisions of the cribbage board (1\u201330, 31\u201360, 61\u201390, and 91\u2013120) is colloquially called a \"street\".  Being at 15 points would be on first street, being at 59 points would be on second street, etc.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Card game]]\n*[[Cribbage statistics]]\n*[[Cribbage Solitaire]] and [[Cribbage Square Solitaire]], two [[solitaire]] card games based on Cribbage\n*[[Hounds and Jackals]], an Ancient Egyptian game, which uses a similar board\n*[[Kings Cribbage]], a game with cribbage hands being constructed crossword-style\n*[[Pub games]]\n*[[American Cribbage Congress]], sanctioning body for cribbage clubs and tournaments\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |first=John |last=Scarne |year=1965 |title=Scarne on Card Games |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-43603-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/scarneoncardgame00john/page/395 395\u2013404] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/scarneoncardgame00john/page/395 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Joe |last=Wergin |year=1980 |title=Win at Cribbage |publisher=Oldcastle Books |isbn=0-948353-97-X\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Cribbage}}\n* [http://www.cribbage.org/ American Cribbage Congress]\n\n{{Non trick-taking card games}}\n\n[[Category:17th-century card games]]\n[[Category:Cribbage]]\n[[Category:Adding games]]\n[[Category:Two-player card games]]\n[[Category:Four-player card games]]\n[[Category:Pub games]]\n[[Category:English card games]]\n[[Category:Matching games]]\n", "name_user": "Kittridge7", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing and editing anecdotal claims about cribbage, (e.g. \"many games may be decided by just a single digit margin\").

The critical success of the album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of [[outlaw country]], a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legality of cannabis|legalization of marijuana]].\n\nBorn during the [[Great Depression]] and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a [[disc jockey]] in [[Texas]] radio stations and a singer in [[honky-tonk]]s. Nelson moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]], where he wrote \"[[Family Bible (song)|Family Bible]]\" and recorded the song \"Lumberjack\" in 1956. He also worked as a disc jockey at various radio stations in Vancouver and nearby [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 1958, he moved to [[Houston]], Texas, after signing a contract with [[D Records]]. He sang at the [[Esquire Ballroom]] weekly and he worked as a disk jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\", \"[[Hello Walls]]\", \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\", and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].\n\nIn 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\", and \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], Waylon Jennings, and [[Kris Kristofferson]].\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album\u2014destined to the IRS\u2014and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Young-willie-nelson.jpg|upright|thumb|left|150px|Nelson as a junior at [[Abbott High School]], 1949]]\n[[File:Willie-Nelson-Highschool.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Nelson's high school football portrait, {{circa}} 1950|alt=A man with a leather helmet and a white football jersey]]\nNelson was born in [[Abbott, Texas]], on April 29, 1933,{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|2008|p=13}} the son of Myrle Marie (''n\u00e9e'' Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson.{{sfn|Scobey, Lola|1982|p=58}} His birth was incorrectly recorded by Dr. F.

He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.\n\nNelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: \"[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]\" and \"When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song\". He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them.{{sfn|Thomson, Graeme|p=24|2012}} He then had stints working for KDNT in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[KZMP (AM)|KCUL]], and [[KFJZ|KCNC]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], where he hosted ''[[The Western Express]]'', taught [[Sunday school]], and played in nightclubs.

On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song \"[[Mr. Record Man]]\" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Bud Shrake; Edwin Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey.

During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond, Clint|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing \"Hello Walls\" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser, Michael|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's \"Night Life\", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine, Michael|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of \"Crazy.\" Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|2008|p=6}} \"Crazy\" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}\n\nNelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at [[Quonset Hut Studio]]. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including \"[[Willingly]]\" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and \"[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]\" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards, David; Callahan, Mike|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Johnny Bush; Rick Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]]. He then worked on the west coast offices of Pamper Records, in [[Pico Rivera, California]]. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside of Nashville.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=5}} [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: \"I Never Cared For You\".{{sfn|Scobey, Lola|p=190|1982}}\n\n[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]\n\nBy the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to [[RCA Victor]] at the behest of [[Chet Atkins]], signing a contract for $10,000 per year.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}} 224]}} ''[[Country Willie \u2013 His Own Songs]]'' became Nelson's first RCA Victor album, recorded in April 1965.

In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near [[Bandera, Texas]], and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single \"I'm a Memory\" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Kienzle, Richard|2003|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=Gq2TTa6TStkC|page=248}} 248]}} After he recorded his final RCA single, \"Mountain Dew\" (backed with \"Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes\"), in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Due to the failure of his albums, and particularly frustrated by the reception of ''[[Yesterday's Wine]]'', although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire from music.{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Bud Shrake; Edwin Shrake|2000|p=167}}\n\n===Outlaw country and success (1972\u20131989)===\nNelson moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]) rejuvenated the singer.

The critical success of the album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of [[outlaw country]], a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legality of cannabis|legalization of marijuana]].\n\nBorn during the [[Great Depression]] and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a [[disc jockey]] in [[Texas]] radio stations and a singer in [[honky-tonk]]s. Nelson moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]], where he wrote \"[[Family Bible (song)|Family Bible]]\" and recorded the song \"Lumberjack\" in 1956. He also worked as a disc jockey at various radio stations in Vancouver and nearby [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 1958, he moved to [[Houston]], Texas, after signing a contract with [[D Records]]. He sang at the [[Esquire Ballroom]] weekly and he worked as a disk jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\", \"[[Hello Walls]]\", \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\", and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].\n\nIn 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\", and \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], Waylon Jennings, and [[Kris Kristofferson]].\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album\u2014destined to the IRS\u2014and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the bio-diesel brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], which is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Young-willie-nelson.jpg|upright|thumb|left|150px|Nelson as a junior at [[Abbott High School]], 1949]]\n[[File:Willie-Nelson-Highschool.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Nelson's high school football portrait, {{circa}} 1950|alt=A man with a leather helmet and a white football jersey]]\nNelson was born in [[Abbott, Texas]], on April 29, 1933,{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|2008|p=13}} the son of Myrle Marie (''n\u00e9e'' Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson.{{sfn|Scobey, Lola|1982|p=58}} His birth was incorrectly recorded by Dr. F.

He also raised pigs with the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]].{{sfn|Scobey, Lola|1982|p=58}} While still at school, he sang and played guitar in The Texans, a band formed by his sister's husband, Bud Fletcher.{{sfn|Kienzle, Richard|p=236|2003}} The band played in honky tonks, and also had a Sunday morning spot at [[KHBR (AM)|KHBR]] in [[Hillsboro, Texas]]. Meanwhile, Nelson had a short stint as a relief phone operator in Abbott, followed by a job as a tree trimmer for the local electric company, as well as a pawn shop employee.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=4}} After leaving school in 1950, he joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] for eight to nine months<!--why so short a time?-->.{{sfn|Chapman, Roger|2010|p=392}} Upon his return in 1952, he married Martha Matthews, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at [[Baylor University]], where he joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon|Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity]], until dropping out to pursue a career in music.{{sfn|Richmond, Clint|2000|p=24}} He worked as a nightclub bouncer, autohouse partsman, saddle maker, and tree trimmer again. He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.\n\nNelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: \"[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]\" and \"When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song\". He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them.{{sfn|Thomson, Graeme|p=24|2012}} He then had stints working for KDNT in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[KZMP (AM)|KCUL]], and [[KFJZ|KCNC]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], where he hosted ''[[The Western Express]]'', taught [[Sunday school]], and played in nightclubs. He then decided to move to [[San Diego]] but, when he was unable to find a job there, he hitchhiked to [[Portland, Oregon]], where his mother lived.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=4}} When nobody picked him up, he ended up sleeping in a ditch{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Ritz, David|2015|p=92}} before hopping a [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] bound for [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].

After failing to land a spot on the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', he started to work as a dishwasher. Unhappy with his job, he moved back to Texas. After a short time in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], he settled in Fort Worth, and quit the music business for a year.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=4}} He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door,{{sfn|Dingus, Anne|1992|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZysEAAAAMBAJ|77|page=77}} 77]}} and eventually became a sales manager for the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=5}}\n\nAfter his son Billy was born in 1958, the family moved to [[Houston]], Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song \"[[Mr. Record Man]]\" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Bud Shrake; Edwin Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey. During this time, he recorded two singles for [[Pappy Daily]] on [[D Records]]{{sfn|Smith, Michael William|2013}} \"[[Man With the Blues]]\"/\"The Storm Has Just Begun\" and \"[[What a Way to Live (song)|What a Way to Live]]\"/\"Misery Mansion\".{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Bud Shrake; Edwin Shrake|2000|p=117}} Nelson then was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to work as an instructor in his school. He sold \"[[Family Bible (song)|Family Bible]]\" to Buskirk for $50 and \"[[Night Life (Willie Nelson song)|Night Life]]\" for $150.{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Bud Shrake; Edwin Shrake|2000|p=118}} \"Family Bible\" turned into a hit for [[Claude Gray]] in 1960.{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|p=102|2008}}\n\n{{Listen |type=music |filename=Hello Walls.ogg|title=\"Hello Walls\" |description=Written by Willie Nelson, \"Hello Walls\", was a hit for Faron Young in 1961, and the song that gave Nelson national recognition as a songwriter. He recorded the song for his debut album ''...&nbsp;And Then I Wrote''.}}\n\nNelson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1960, but was unable to find a label to sign him. During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond, Clint|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing \"Hello Walls\" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser, Michael|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's \"Night Life\", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine, Michael|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of \"Crazy.\" Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski, Joe Nick|2008|p=6}} \"Crazy\" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}\n\nNelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at [[Quonset Hut Studio]]. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including \"[[Willingly]]\" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and \"[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]\" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards, David; Callahan, Mike|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Johnny Bush; Rick Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]]. He then worked on the west coast offices of Pamper Records, in [[Pico Rivera, California]]. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside of Nashville.{{sfn|Myers, Judy|1969|p=5}} [[Fred Foster]] of [[Monument Records]] signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: \"I Never Cared For You\".{{sfn|Scobey, Lola|p=190|1982}}\n\n[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]\n\nBy the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to [[RCA Victor]] at the behest of [[Chet Atkins]], signing a contract for $10,000 per year.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|224|page=224}} 224]}} ''[[Country Willie \u2013 His Own Songs]]'' became Nelson's first RCA Victor album, recorded in April 1965.

In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near [[Bandera, Texas]], and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single \"I'm a Memory\" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Kienzle, Richard|2003|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=Gq2TTa6TStkC|page=248}} 248]}} After he recorded his final RCA single, \"Mountain Dew\" (backed with \"Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes\"), in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not.{{sfn|Reid, Jan|2004|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=qCDF5fFuBT8C|page=223}} 223]}} Due to the failure of his albums, and particularly frustrated by the reception of ''[[Yesterday's Wine]]'', although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire from music.{{sfn|Nelson, Willie; Bud Shrake; Edwin Shrake|2000|p=167}}\n\n===Outlaw country and success (1972\u20131989)===\nNelson moved to [[Austin, Texas]], where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]) rejuvenated the singer.

Although she is praised by the audience, her music teacher Rudig feels that she can not be the greatest [[opera]] singer in history until she performs in [[New York City]]. When she is criticized for not putting her soul into the song, she gets mad, until she suddenly notices a mysterious man walking on the street. She becomes smitten with the man, until Rudig claims that he is a [[male prostitution|gigolo]] whose latest client is Marchesa Bianca San Giovanni, a former diva with a notorious past.\n\nLater that night, Nella decides to head to [[Budapest]], accompanied by Rudig, her butler Conrad, her maid Emma and her fianc\u00e9 Count Albert von Gronac, whom she is not in love with. She is shocked when she finds out the mysterious man is on board as well, with the marchesa as his company. Rudig again suggests that she will never be a great singer if she does not experience love. The next day, Rudig announces that Fletcher is in town to sign European artists, an agent for the prestigious [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York. Later that afternoon, she finds out her fianc\u00e9 is having an affair with one of her enemies.\n\nFurious and upset with her love life, she goes to the hotel where she is staying and decides to hire the mysterious man, Jim, in hopes of experience love and thereby impress Fletcher. She is attracted to him, but is afraid to have her as his admirer. Jim, who is actually agent Fletcher, soon finds out that Nella thinks that he is a gigolo. Instead of revealing the truth, he pretends to be one and dominantly forces her to make a decision: spend the night with him or leave within 3 minutes.\n\nNella decides to spend the night with him, but leaves the next morning before he awakes. That night, she again gives a performance of ''Tosca'', which is acclaimed as her best in her entire career. After returning home, she is overcome by joy to find out that she has landed a contract with the Metropolitan Opera, but feels guilty for what she has done the night before. The same day, Jim visits her, returning the necklace she has left to pay for his services and demanding her to choose between him and the contract. When she tears up the contract, he realizes that she is in love with him and he reveals himself to be a nephew of the marchesa and the famous talent scout.

At the time, the business was under the [[Disney Interactive Media Group|Disney Online]] business unit.<ref group=ChWDC>{{cite web|title=July-December 1996 |url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1996jul.htm|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the company purchased [[Infoseek]], and that purchase included [[Starwave]]. With that purchase there were now many other online properties under Disney Online including [[Disney.com]], DisneyStore.com, MrShowbiz.com, [[FamilyFun.com|Family.com]], [[Movies.com]], [[ESPN.com]], [[National Football League#Internet.2Fnew media|NFL.com]], [[Nascar.com#Nascar.com|NASCAR.com]], [[Nhl.com|NHL.com]], etc. This led to a new business named [[Disney Interactive Media Group|Buena Vista Internet Group]] (BVIG) which grouped all internet sites under one business unit. In 1999, the business was changed from BVIG to [[Go.com]] and was then spun that off as a [[tracking stock]]. Also in 1999 the DisneyStore.com business was moved under a business named Disney Direct Marketing (DDM). DDM was a business entity under the company's [[Disney Consumer Products]] (DCP) division and ran the Disney Catalog. At the same time all of this was happening, the team that ran the DisneyStore.com site also built and launched ESPNStore.com, NASCARStore.com, DisneyTickets.com and DisneyAuctions.com.\n\n'''Disney Auctions''' was created in October 2000 with a partnership between [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[eBay]]. Items such as signs and ride vehicles from [[Disneyland]] and [[Walt Disney World]] were commonly sold as well as costume pieces and props from previously released movies from [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]].\n\nIn 2001, DDM was moved directly under the control of The Disney Stores business. The sale of The Disney Stores to The Children's Place didn't include the sale of DDM but did include the sale of the DisneyStore.com [[domain name]], so in 2004 DisneyStore.com was changed to DisneyDirect.com.\n\nIn 2006, a complete rebranding was done. Disney Direct Marketing, Inc. was changed to Disney Shopping, Inc. (DSI), the domain was changed from DisneyDirect.com to DisneyShopping.com and the Disney Catalog business was shut down. In fall of 2006, Disney ended their partnership with eBay and moved the Disney Auctions website under its own banner.\n\nIn 2008, after the repurchase of the Disney Store business from The Children's Place, the domain was changed back to DisneyStore.com. In 2009, DisneyAuctions.com was completely shut down. In 2010, DSI was moved back under the control of the newly reacquired Disney Store business and a complete redesign of the site was launched. Also in 2010, the Disneystore.co.uk site was completely rebuilt on the same platform as the US site. The Walt Disney Company acquired [[Marvel Entertainment]] in 2009, and in 2011, MarvelStore.com was relaunched using the same technology as the Disney Store website. A new online store  for the French market was launched and a new store for the German market was launched.\n\nA special Disney World vintage apparel line called \"YesterEars\" was available at the online store for a limited time in August 2016.

In 1999, the business was changed from BVIG to [[Go.com]] and was then spun that off as a [[tracking stock]]. Also in 1999 the DisneyStore.com business was moved under a business named Disney Direct Marketing (DDM). DDM was a business entity under the company's [[Disney Consumer Products]] (DCP) division and ran the Disney Catalog.

The sale of The Disney Stores to The Children's Place didn't include the sale of DDM but did include the sale of the DisneyStore.com [[domain name]], so in 2004 DisneyStore.com was changed to DisneyDirect.com.\n\nIn 2006, a complete rebranding was done. Disney Direct Marketing, Inc. was changed to Disney Shopping, Inc. (DSI), the domain was changed from DisneyDirect.com to DisneyShopping.com and the Disney Catalog business was shut down. In fall of 2006, Disney ended their partnership with eBay and moved the Disney Auctions website under its own banner.\n\nIn 2008, after the repurchase of the Disney Store business from The Children's Place, the domain was changed back to DisneyStore.com. In 2009, DisneyAuctions.com was completely shut down. In 2010, DSI was moved back under the control of the newly reacquired Disney Store business and a complete redesign of the site was launched. Also in 2010, the Disneystore.co.uk site was completely rebuilt on the same platform as the US site. The Walt Disney Company acquired [[Marvel Entertainment]] in 2009, and in 2011, MarvelStore.com was relaunched using the same technology as the Disney Store website.

This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew.

It took three spacewalks to outfit and activate the new component, during which Melroy acted as internal spacewalk choreographer. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers.
