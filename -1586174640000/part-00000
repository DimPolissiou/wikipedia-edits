It followed by four and a half months the release of Springsteen's 1987 album, ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]''.  Considerably shorter in duration than most Springsteen tours before or since, it played limited engagements in most cities, leading to tickets being in great demand.  Shows were held in arenas in the U.S. and stadiums in Europe and included a historic performance in [[East Berlin]].\n\nComing on the heels of the massively successful ''[[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]]'', the Tunnel of Love Express was designed to disorient Springsteen's audiences.  A theatrical entrance began the show, a full horn section appeared, band members were rearranged from their customary positions, and on-stage spontaneity was kept to a minimum. [[Set list]]s were unusually static, and many of Springsteen's most popular concert numbers were omitted altogether.  Instead, the shows featured Springsteen [[B-sides]] and [[outtake]]s as well as renditions of obscure genre songs by others.  Critical reaction to the concerts was generally favorable, with some mixed reviews, while audiences were sometimes baffled.\n\nThe show featured backup singer [[Patti Scialfa]] brought center stage and the object of sexually themed presentations unusual for Springsteen.  That, combined with the dour nature of many ''Tunnel of Love'' songs, led to speculation that Springsteen's marriage to [[Julianne Phillips]] was troubled.  Further visual evidence of Springsteen and Scialfa becoming a couple emerged as the tour progressed, his separation from Phillips was officially confirmed, and for the first time Springsteen became the subject of a tabloid fervor.  Springsteen and Scialfa eventually married, and the Tunnel of Love Express shows were the last full-length ones Springsteen would play with the E Street Band for eleven years.\n\n==Itinerary==\nThe tour came four and a half months after the release of Springsteen's 1987 album, ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'', which had sold well \u2013 although nowhere near the blockbuster levels of its predecessor, ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'', which the album was partly a counter-reaction to \u2013 and already generated a hit single in \"[[Brilliant Disguise]]\".<ref name=\"marsh-172\"/><ref name=\"marsh-175\"/><ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/><ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  In part, the unusual lag reflected the ambivalence of the album; Springsteen had first recorded it solely by himself, and then some E Street Band parts had been dubbed in.<ref name=\"marsh-175\"/>  Indeed, Springsteen and the band had started to drift apart over the previous two or three years, seldom speaking amongst themselves.<ref name=\"gospel-105\">Symynkywicz, ''The Gospel According to Bruce Springsteen'', p. 105.</ref>  Springsteen had considered going out on tour solo, and his management had provisionally booked 3,000-seat halls around the country.<ref name=\"hilburn-int\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Sh0fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VKcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1238,445245&dq=springsteen+tour&hl=en | title=Springsteen plays few hits on 'Tunnel of Love' tour | author=Hilburn, Robert | format=[[Los Angeles Times]] | newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | date=March 2, 1988 | page=G-9| author-link=Robert Hilburn }}</ref>  But he eventually decided against that approach, feeling the tone of the resulting show would be too dark.<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/>\n\nThe tour was officially announced on January 6, 1988.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VnFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kBIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6461,1047878&dq=springsteen+tunnel+of+love+tour&hl=en | title=Springsteen tour begins in February | newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]] | date=January 7, 1988 | page=3}}</ref> One of the few Springsteen tours to be formally named, the \"Express\" part came from its shorter duration \u2013 roughly half his typical length \u2013 and the shorter stays in any given location, generally just one or two nights.\n\nThe United States leg of the tour took place in [[arena]]s,<ref name=\"derkins-70\">Derkins, ''Bruce Springsteen'', p. 70.</ref> starting on February 25 at the [[Worcester Centrum]] and continuing for 43 shows.  There were five-night stands in two major markets, at the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] and at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]]; the shows at the latter closed the American leg on May 23.

Apparently having achieved all he could along those lines, and feeling that the Born in the U.S.A.

Band members entered the stage two by two, taking tickets from Magovern, each (with the help of a professional costumer) more sharply dressed than for previous tours:<ref name=\"marsh-175\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', p. 175.</ref>  [[Max Weinberg]] and [[Danny Federici]], [[Garry Tallent]] and [[Nils Lofgren]], the horn section.  Next came [[Patti Scialfa]] in a tight [[mini-skirt]],<ref name=\"rh-erg\"/> [[big hair]] and carrying a bunch of balloons: more foreshadowing.  Once in their positions, band members started their parts in the song.<ref name=\"guterman-174\"/>  Penultimately, [[Clarence Clemons]] entered with a single rose between his teeth.  Springsteen appeared last, dressed in trousers, a jacket and white shirt that departed from his past denim-and-bandanas look, matched the [[Annie Leibovitz]]-photographed look from the ''Tunnel'' album cover, and emphasized the greater formality of what was about to come.<ref name=\"santelli-book\"/><ref name=\"marsh-178\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', p. 178.</ref><ref name=\"btr-350\"/>  Once present, the band's traditional positions on stage were flipped:<ref name=\"guterman-173\"/> now Clemons was on the right, Bittan on the left, and so on; Weinberg moved from the center to the side, and backup singer Scialfa from the back riser to the front where Clemons had been.<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\">{{cite news | title=Bruce Springsteen's Tunnel Vision | author=Pond, Steve | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=May 5, 1988 | format=cover story | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteens-tunnel-vision-19880505}}</ref>  Springsteen declared this to be evidence of his desire to shake things up when rehearsals began: \"The first thing I did was make everyone stand in a different place.\"<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>\n\nThe music of the show itself was a departure, and the show overall more subdued than in the past,<ref name=\"santelli-book\"/> with the return to arenas making the show more accessible.<ref name=\"blade\"/> Yet at the same time the stage presentation was more stylized and choreographed than on any tour before.<ref name=\"guterman-174\"/> The country-influenced rock and serious ballads of the new album were not ideal stage material.<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/>  Audiences expected the moody \"Tunnel of Love\" to open, but the second slot \u2014 which in past years was filled by well-known rousers such as \"[[Badlands (Bruce Springsteen song)|Badlands]]\", \"[[Out in the Street]]\" or \"[[Prove It All Night]]\" \u2014 now was ... \"[[Be True]]\", an obscure, lightweight [[B-side]]<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> to the underperforming 1981 \"[[Fade Away (Bruce Springsteen song)|Fade Away]]\" single.  And so the show's theme was established \u2014 an examination of relationships, often of the failed, sour variety, much as the album had been.<ref name=\"marsh-172\"/>  A long spoken introduction to \"[[Spare Parts (song)|Spare Parts]]\" over a quiet piano backing by [[Roy Bittan]] reiterated the song's hardscrabble setting.<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"marsh-182\"/>  Theatrics were up throughout:  A tortured rendition of the Biblical \"Adam Raised a Cain\", sitting on a park bench with Clemons in a long prologue to \"All That Heaven Will Allow\",<ref name=\"marsh-180\"/> the horn section throughout swooping and swaying and doing every bit of stage shtick known to horn sections.\n\nPlenty of songs (typically eight or nine) from ''Tunnel of Love'' appeared, as would be expected, and much if not all of the audience were reasonably familiar with them, as the album had been out for a while.<ref>Cavicchi, ''Tramps Like Us'', p. 86.</ref>  But the dominance of obscurities, of B-sides and outtakes, continued,<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"nd-wantagh\">{{cite news | title=Springsteen a Steamy Hit in Detroit | author=Williams, Stephen | newspaper=[[Newsday]] | date=April 1, 1988 | page=  }}</ref> with immediate audience response sacrificed for what might be a slower but deeper understanding.<ref name=\"rh-erg\"/>  Springsteen said, \"The idea on this tour is that you wouldn't know what song was gonna come next. ... [The show feels] real new, real modern to me. I figure some people will wrestle with it a little bit. But that's okay.\"<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  Some fans worried that Springsteen looked like he was not having as much fun on stage as in the past.<ref name=\"us-hinck\"/>  The first set saw \"Roulette\", a previously unreleased number from ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'' sessions about the [[Three Mile Island accident]],<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/> (which was paired with the previous tour's \"Seeds\" to lend an element of sociological anguish to the personal).<ref name=\"nyt-msg\"/>  The second set saw Springsteen assuming the manner of a [[televangelist]] or [[professional wrestler]]<ref name=\"marsh-180\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', pp. 179\u2013180.</ref>  delivering \"I Am a Coward\", a remake of [[Gino Washington]]'s little-known 1964 local Detroit hit \"Gino Is a Coward\",<ref name=\"guterman-175\"/><ref name=\"btr-350\"/> and \"Part Man, Part Monkey\", a never-before-heard, Springsteen-written quasi-reggae ode to the [[Scopes monkey trial]] by way of [[Mickey & Sylvia]]'s \"[[Love is Strange]]\".<ref name=\"guterman-175\">Guterman, ''Runaway American Dream'', p. 175</ref>  Audiences were bewildered.<ref name=\"ap-worc\"/><ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/>\n\nGone completely were several of Springsteen's most popular numbers and traditional concert warhorses:  \"[[Badlands (Bruce Springsteen song)|Badlands]]\", \"[[The Promised Land (Bruce Springsteen song)|The Promised Land]]\", \"[[Thunder Road (song)|Thunder Road]]\", \"[[Jungleland]]\".<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/><ref name=\"mj-thor\"/>  Springsteen had said as the tour began, \"when I went to put this show together, I said, 'Well, what were the songs that were the kind of cornerstones of what I had done? Those are the ones I automatically put to the side.'\"<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/>\n\nThe first set did close with a blockbuster pairing of \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" and \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\"; compared to the latter's opening of shows during the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], it now served to sum up a set's worth of personal struggles and counter any mistaken notions about the song's patriotic intent.<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"guterman-175\"/>  The first hour and a half of the show featured no selections from Springsteen albums prior to ''Born in the U.S.A.'' other than \"Adam Raised a Cain\".<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/>  The main set closer, a position long held by \"[[Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)|Rosalita]]\" until cut during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, was now held by the fairly obscure, [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse-flavored]] and hotly played, Springsteen-written-but-[[Joan Jett]]-recorded \"[[Light of Day (song)|(Just Around the Corner to the) Light of Day]]\" (it would hold this position for band-based Springsteen tours through the end of 2000).<ref name=\"guterman-174\"/><ref name=\"blade\"/><ref name=\"marsh-182\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', p. 182.</ref>\n\nThe encores began with Springsteen's [[signature song]], \"[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]]\", recast completely, slowly played solo by Springsteen on [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[harmonica]] and with a melancholy feel,<ref name=\"blade\"/><ref name=\"marsh-182\"/> albeit with the band standing behind him,<ref name=\"guterman-174\">Guterman, ''Runaway American Dream'', p. 174</ref> sometimes with an audience sing-along of \"whoa-whoa's\" at the end.  Springsteen prefaced these performances with an introduction along the same lines every night:<ref name=\"masur-161\">Masur, ''Runaway Dream'', pp. 160\u2013161.</ref> \"Before we came out on tour, I was sitting around home trying to decide what we were gonna be doing out here this time. What I felt I wanted to sing and say to you.\"  After detailing how he came to write \"Born to Run\" a decade and a half earlier, he would say that its overt theme of escapism had concealed a deeper search for connection and for a place its protagonists could call home.  That, now, to Springsteen meant a place deep within oneself.<ref name=\"mj-thor\"/><ref name=\"masur-161\"/>  He concluded by saying, \"I wanna do this song tonight for all of you, wishing with all my heart that you have a safe trip to home.\"<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"marsh-183\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', p. 183.</ref>\n\nAfter this, Springsteen finally retreated into normalcy, with the last half-hour of the show an upbeat, redemptive sequence that ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a \"rip-roaring, cinderblock-shaking jubilee.\"<ref name=\"spokchr\"/><ref name=\"nyt-worc\"/>  Presented were top hits such as \"[[Hungry Heart]]\" and \"[[Glory Days (Bruce Springsteen song)|Glory Days]]\" (both with heavy roles from the horn section)<ref name=\"ap-worc\"/> and even, in the second encores, the resurrection of a couple of veteran numbers dropped midway through the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, \"Rosalita\" and the \"Detroit Medley\".<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"ap-worc\"/>  Springsteen reasoned that the latter's \"[[Devil with a Blue Dress On]]\" was actually the ultimate moment of the show, as the 'trick' of juxtaposing serious, emotional content with exciting entertainment was pulled off.<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  But those last two would also be gone by the latter stages of the American leg, and the second encore would be filled with more regional obscurities such as [[The Sonics]]' \"[[Have Love, Will Travel]]\" and unlikely attempts at [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\". The encores also delved into Springsteen's longtime interest in soul music, showcasing [[Percy Sledge]]'s 1967 arrangement of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", [[Arthur Conley]]'s \"[[Sweet Soul Music]]\", and a longtime staple, [[Eddie Floyd]]'s \"[[Raise Your Hand]]\".<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/>\n\nOverall, shows ran a little under three hours in length, up to an hour shorter than what audiences had become accustomed to with Springsteen.<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> [[Set list]]s were unusually static during the tour,<ref name=\"rh-erg\"/><ref name=\"guterman-174\"/><ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> a deliberate decision by Springsteen, who saw the show as \"focused and specific\".<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  Not having to play multiple shows in many venues also helped, although some of the faithful<ref name=\"upi-worc\"/> were travelling to multiple cities to see the tour. During the early weeks, often only one song changed per night; a two-night stand at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]] saw no changes at all, highly unusual especially in Springsteen's home territories.<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/>\n\nDuring later shows on the European leg, setlists began to change, with occasional surprise additions.<ref name=\"derkins-75\"/>  \"Badlands\" began appearing, and \"Thunder Road\" a couple of times,<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> while televangelist-styled song introductions were dropped due to lack of cultural context.<ref name=\"marsh-180\"/>  The many Americans at a [[West German]] show at [[Frankfurt]]'s [[Waldstadion (Frankfurt)|Waldstadion]] waved flags as \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was played, with [[United States Ambassador to Germany|U. S. Ambassador to Germany]] [[Richard Burt]] in attendance.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1wZbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Bk4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3850,891527 | title=Names in the News | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Durant Daily Democrat]] | date=July 13, 1988 | page=2}}</ref>\n\n==The East Berlin show==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0719-38, Bruce Springsteen, Konzert in der DDR.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Springsteen performing at the [[Radrennbahn Wei\u00dfensee]] in [[East Berlin]] on July 19, 1988]]\n\nMost unusual of the European shows was one in [[East Berlin]] on July 19, 1988, some 16 months before the [[Berlin Wall]] came down.

I smelled the American spirit that night and I'll never forget it!\"</ref>  The show became one of the most politically meaningful moments of Springsteen's career.<ref name=\"alterman\"/>\n\nSince the initial reports, some estimates of the crowd size have been increased, often to a figure of 300,000.<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/><ref name=\"cbc-eb\"/>  Internet posters have made claims as high as 500,000. In 2013, Erik Kirschbaum, a Berlin-based journalist, published his book ''Rocking the Wall: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World'', which argues that the Springsteen concert was a signal event in the process that led to the [[Peaceful Revolution]], the fall of the Wall, and [[Die Wende]].<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/>  Gerd Dietrich, a professor of history at [[Humboldt University]], was quoted saying that \"Springsteen's concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people \u2026 more eager for more and more change \u2026 It showed people how locked up they really were.\"<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/><ref name=\"cbc-eb\"/>  Thomas Wilke, who has studied the impact of popular music in East Germany, said \"It was a topic of discussion for quite some time afterwards. There was clearly a different feeling and a different sentiment in East Germany after that concert.\"<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/> \n\n==Life imitating art imitating life==\nFrom the first release of ''Tunnel of Love'', there had listeners who wondered if some of the gloomy portrayals of interpersonal relationships on the album indicated that Springsteen's 1985 marriage to actress and model [[Julianne Phillips]] was in trouble.<ref name=\"hilburn\"/>  Others, however, cautioned against such interpretations, pointing out that Springsteen's 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' had been full of intense tales of spree killers and other criminals, of which Springsteen clearly had no personal experience.<ref name=\"hilburn\"/><ref name=\"usa062388\"/>  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' music writer [[Robert Hilburn]], interviewing Springsteen at the Worcester start of the tour, wrote that \"Springsteen seemed extremely comfortable sitting on a sofa with his wife in the dressing room area \u2013 a picture that seemed to contradict the speculation that ''Tunnel of Love'''s songs of troubled romance reflected signs of trouble in his own marriage.\"<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/>\n\nIn addition to everything else, what was different about the Tunnel of Love Express was Springsteen's first go at explicit carnality,<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/> from the opening \"Tunnel of Love\", where he and Scialfa sang cheek to cheek with lips nearly touching at the same microphone, to other numbers such as \"Part Man, Part Monkey\".<ref name=\"guterman-175\"/>  A centerpiece of the second set was an eight-minute reworking of one of ''The River''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s casual rockers, \"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\".  Now it was recast into [[rockabilly]] mode, with a half-spoken, half-sung introduction detailing a youth's frustrations up to the iconic car parked with a girlfriend on a lovers' lane.  Out come the horn section, sans horns, to do synchronized dancing<ref name=\"guterman-175\"/> and sing call-and-response.  Out come Scialfa and two women from backstage, three temptresses for the six assembled men.  Around they circle each other, as Springsteen sings \"You Can Look\", resting the microphone below his belt in between lines.  Finally the song winds down, as Springsteen and Scialfa stare at each other.  Springsteen goes back to the drum kit, where a tray full of water and a sponge are.  In tours past, this was a classic moment of Springsteen the relentless showman; he would sponge off his head, gulp down water and spray it over the stage, revitalizing himself to keep on playing for a few more hours.  Now, however, he took the sponge, pulled his pants out by his belt buckle, and squeezed the water down into his crotch.

It followed by four and a half months the release of Springsteen's 1987 album, ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]''.  Considerably shorter in duration than most Springsteen tours before or since, it played limited engagements in most cities, leading to tickets being in great demand.  Shows were held in arenas in the U.S. and stadiums in Europe and included a historic performance in [[East Berlin]].\n\nComing on the heels of the massively successful ''[[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]]'', the Tunnel of Love Express was designed to disorient Springsteen's audiences.  A theatrical entrance began the show, a full horn section appeared, band members were rearranged from their customary positions, and on-stage spontaneity was kept to a minimum. [[Set list]]s were unusually static, and many of Springsteen's most popular concert numbers were omitted altogether.  Instead, the shows featured Springsteen [[B-sides]] and [[outtake]]s as well as renditions of obscure genre songs by others.  Critical reaction to the concerts was generally favorable, with some mixed reviews, while audiences were sometimes baffled.\n\nThe show featured backup singer [[Patti Scialfa]] brought center stage and the object of sexually themed presentations unusual for Springsteen.  That, combined with the dour nature of many ''Tunnel of Love'' songs, led to speculation that Springsteen's marriage to [[Julianne Phillips]] was troubled.  Further visual evidence of Springsteen and Scialfa becoming a couple emerged as the tour progressed, his separation from Phillips was officially confirmed, and for the first time Springsteen became the subject of a tabloid fervor.  Springsteen and Scialfa eventually married, and the Tunnel of Love Express shows were the last full-length ones Springsteen would play with the E Street Band for eleven years.\n\n==Itinerary==\nThe tour came four and a half months after the release of Springsteen's 1987 album, ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'', which had sold well \u2013 although nowhere near the blockbuster levels of its predecessor, ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'', which the album was partly a counter-reaction to \u2013 and already generated a hit single in \"[[Brilliant Disguise]]\".<ref name=\"marsh-172\"/><ref name=\"marsh-175\"/><ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/><ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  In part, the unusual lag reflected the ambivalence of the album; Springsteen had first recorded it solely by himself, and then some E Street Band parts had been dubbed in.<ref name=\"marsh-175\"/>  Indeed, Springsteen and the band had started to drift apart over the previous two or three years, seldom speaking amongst themselves.<ref name=\"gospel-105\">Symynkywicz, ''The Gospel According to Bruce Springsteen'', p. 105.</ref>  Springsteen had considered going out on tour solo, and his management had provisionally booked 3,000-seat halls around the country.<ref name=\"hilburn-int\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Sh0fAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VKcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1238,445245&dq=springsteen+tour&hl=en | title=Springsteen plays few hits on 'Tunnel of Love' tour | author=Hilburn, Robert | format=[[Los Angeles Times]] | newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | date=March 2, 1988 | page=G-9| author-link=Robert Hilburn }}</ref>  But he eventually decided against that approach, feeling the tone of the resulting show would be too dark.<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/>\n\nThe tour was officially announced on January 6, 1988.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VnFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kBIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6461,1047878&dq=springsteen+tunnel+of+love+tour&hl=en | title=Springsteen tour begins in February | newspaper=[[Milwaukee Sentinel]] | date=January 7, 1988 | page=3}}</ref> One of the few Springsteen tours to be formally named, the \"Express\" part came from its shorter duration \u2013 roughly half his typical length \u2013 and the shorter stays in any given location, generally just one or two nights.\n\nThe United States leg of the tour took place in [[arena]]s,<ref name=\"derkins-70\">Derkins, ''Bruce Springsteen'', p. 70.</ref> starting on February 25 at the [[Worcester Centrum]] and continuing for 43 shows.  There were five-night stands in two major markets, at the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] and at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]]; the shows at the latter closed the American leg on May 23.  The European leg commenced on June 11 at the [[Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio Comunale]] in [[Turin]], Italy, and continued for 23 shows in  [[stadium]]s, concluding the tour on August 4 <!-- per this Barcelona newspaper story, not August 3, as many websites list; and see also this Brucebase entry http://brucebase.wikispaces.com/1988 for evidence that it may have been rescheduled from August 3 -->  at [[Barcelona]], Spain's [[Camp Nou]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/hemeroteca/20110421/54141799433/el-primer-concierto-de-bruce-springsteen-en-espana.html | title=El primer concierto de Bruce Springsteen en Espa\u00f1a | newspaper=[[La Vanguardia]] | location=Barcelona | date=April 21, 2011 | language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nThe tour became the first one in which Springsteen did not play his home state of [[New Jersey]]; speculation that he would play a special series of dates there upon his return from the European leg proved unfounded.<ref name=\"derkins-75\">Derkins, ''Bruce Springsteen'', p. 75.</ref><ref name=\"cavicchi-48\"/>\n\n==The show==\nSpringsteen's concerts from his beginnings up through the massively popular [[Born in the U.S.A.

Those are the ones I automatically put to the side.'\"<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/>\n\nThe first set did close with a blockbuster pairing of \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" and \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\"; compared to the latter's opening of shows during the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], it now served to sum up a set's worth of personal struggles and counter any mistaken notions about the song's patriotic intent.<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"guterman-175\"/>  The first hour and a half of the show featured no selections from Springsteen albums prior to ''Born in the U.S.A.'' other than \"Adam Raised a Cain\".<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/>  The main set closer, a position long held by \"[[Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)|Rosalita]]\" until cut during the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, was now held by the fairly obscure, [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse-flavored]] and hotly played, Springsteen-written-but-[[Joan Jett]]-recorded \"[[Light of Day (song)|(Just Around the Corner to the) Light of Day]]\" (it would hold this position for band-based Springsteen tours through the end of 2000).<ref name=\"guterman-174\"/><ref name=\"blade\"/><ref name=\"marsh-182\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', p. 182.</ref>\n\nThe encores began with Springsteen's [[signature song]], \"[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]]\", recast completely, slowly played solo by Springsteen on [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[harmonica]] and with a melancholy feel,<ref name=\"blade\"/><ref name=\"marsh-182\"/> albeit with the band standing behind him,<ref name=\"guterman-174\">Guterman, ''Runaway American Dream'', p. 174</ref> sometimes with an audience sing-along of \"whoa-whoa's\" at the end.  Springsteen prefaced these performances with an introduction along the same lines every night:<ref name=\"masur-161\">Masur, ''Runaway Dream'', pp. 160\u2013161.</ref> \"Before we came out on tour, I was sitting around home trying to decide what we were gonna be doing out here this time. What I felt I wanted to sing and say to you.\"  After detailing how he came to write \"Born to Run\" a decade and a half earlier, he would say that its overt theme of escapism had concealed a deeper search for connection and for a place its protagonists could call home.  That, now, to Springsteen meant a place deep within oneself.<ref name=\"mj-thor\"/><ref name=\"masur-161\"/>  He concluded by saying, \"I wanna do this song tonight for all of you, wishing with all my heart that you have a safe trip to home.\"<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"marsh-183\">Marsh, ''Bruce Springsteen On Tour'', p. 183.</ref>\n\nAfter this, Springsteen finally retreated into normalcy, with the last half-hour of the show an upbeat, redemptive sequence that ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a \"rip-roaring, cinderblock-shaking jubilee.\"<ref name=\"spokchr\"/><ref name=\"nyt-worc\"/>  Presented were top hits such as \"[[Hungry Heart]]\" and \"[[Glory Days (Bruce Springsteen song)|Glory Days]]\" (both with heavy roles from the horn section)<ref name=\"ap-worc\"/> and even, in the second encores, the resurrection of a couple of veteran numbers dropped midway through the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, \"Rosalita\" and the \"Detroit Medley\".<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/><ref name=\"ap-worc\"/>  Springsteen reasoned that the latter's \"[[Devil with a Blue Dress On]]\" was actually the ultimate moment of the show, as the 'trick' of juxtaposing serious, emotional content with exciting entertainment was pulled off.<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  But those last two would also be gone by the latter stages of the American leg, and the second encore would be filled with more regional obscurities such as [[The Sonics]]' \"[[Have Love, Will Travel]]\" and unlikely attempts at [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\". The encores also delved into Springsteen's longtime interest in soul music, showcasing [[Percy Sledge]]'s 1967 arrangement of [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", [[Arthur Conley]]'s \"[[Sweet Soul Music]]\", and a longtime staple, [[Eddie Floyd]]'s \"[[Raise Your Hand]]\".<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/>\n\nOverall, shows ran a little under three hours in length, up to an hour shorter than what audiences had become accustomed to with Springsteen.<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> [[Set list]]s were unusually static during the tour,<ref name=\"rh-erg\"/><ref name=\"guterman-174\"/><ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> a deliberate decision by Springsteen, who saw the show as \"focused and specific\".<ref name=\"rs-cover-story\"/>  Not having to play multiple shows in many venues also helped, although some of the faithful<ref name=\"upi-worc\"/> were travelling to multiple cities to see the tour. During the early weeks, often only one song changed per night; a two-night stand at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]] saw no changes at all, highly unusual especially in Springsteen's home territories.<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/>\n\nDuring later shows on the European leg, setlists began to change, with occasional surprise additions.<ref name=\"derkins-75\"/>  \"Badlands\" began appearing, and \"Thunder Road\" a couple of times,<ref name=\"marsh-178\"/> while televangelist-styled song introductions were dropped due to lack of cultural context.<ref name=\"marsh-180\"/>  The many Americans at a [[West German]] show at [[Frankfurt]]'s [[Waldstadion (Frankfurt)|Waldstadion]] waved flags as \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was played, with [[United States Ambassador to Germany|U.

In 2013, Erik Kirschbaum, a Berlin-based journalist, published his book ''Rocking the Wall: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World'', which argues that the Springsteen concert was a signal event in the process that led to the [[Peaceful Revolution]], the fall of the Wall, and [[Die Wende]].<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/>  Gerd Dietrich, a professor of history at [[Humboldt University]], was quoted saying that \"Springsteen's concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people \u2026 more eager for more and more change \u2026 It showed people how locked up they really were.\"<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/><ref name=\"cbc-eb\"/>  Thomas Wilke, who has studied the impact of popular music in East Germany, said \"It was a topic of discussion for quite some time afterwards. There was clearly a different feeling and a different sentiment in East Germany after that concert.\"<ref name=\"guardian-eb\"/> \n\n==Life imitating art imitating life==\nFrom the first release of ''Tunnel of Love'', there had listeners who wondered if some of the gloomy portrayals of interpersonal relationships on the album indicated that Springsteen's 1985 marriage to actress and model [[Julianne Phillips]] was in trouble.<ref name=\"hilburn\"/>  Others, however, cautioned against such interpretations, pointing out that Springsteen's 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' had been full of intense tales of spree killers and other criminals, of which Springsteen clearly had no personal experience.<ref name=\"hilburn\"/><ref name=\"usa062388\"/>  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' music writer [[Robert Hilburn]], interviewing Springsteen at the Worcester start of the tour, wrote that \"Springsteen seemed extremely comfortable sitting on a sofa with his wife in the dressing room area \u2013 a picture that seemed to contradict the speculation that ''Tunnel of Love'''s songs of troubled romance reflected signs of trouble in his own marriage.\"<ref name=\"hilburn-int\"/>\n\nIn addition to everything else, what was different about the Tunnel of Love Express was Springsteen's first go at explicit carnality,<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/> from the opening \"Tunnel of Love\", where he and Scialfa sang cheek to cheek with lips nearly touching at the same microphone, to other numbers such as \"Part Man, Part Monkey\".<ref name=\"guterman-175\"/>  A centerpiece of the second set was an eight-minute reworking of one of ''The River''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s casual rockers, \"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\".  Now it was recast into [[rockabilly]] mode, with a half-spoken, half-sung introduction detailing a youth's frustrations up to the iconic car parked with a girlfriend on a lovers' lane.  Out come the horn section, sans horns, to do synchronized dancing<ref name=\"guterman-175\"/> and sing call-and-response.  Out come Scialfa and two women from backstage, three temptresses for the six assembled men.  Around they circle each other, as Springsteen sings \"You Can Look\", resting the microphone below his belt in between lines.  Finally the song winds down, as Springsteen and Scialfa stare at each other.  Springsteen goes back to the drum kit, where a tray full of water and a sponge are.  In tours past, this was a classic moment of Springsteen the relentless showman; he would sponge off his head, gulp down water and spray it over the stage, revitalizing himself to keep on playing for a few more hours.  Now, however, he took the sponge, pulled his pants out by his belt buckle, and squeezed the water down into his crotch.  Perhaps tame by the standards of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] or [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at the time, but for Springsteen and his audience, a line had been crossed.\n\n''[[Newsday]]'' wrote, \"Dripping wet during 'Part Man, Part Monkey' \u2013 which is as sexual a message as Springsteen has ever transmitted live \u2013 Springsteen was, literally, steaming.\"<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/>  Amplified deep breathing.<ref name=\"nd-wantagh\"/>\n\nThis was all a big change for Scialfa, who had stayed in the background during the 1984\u20131985 [[Born in the U.S.A.

In early 1928, the ''LV series 1'' was presented to the public. Though by modern standards it was merely a truck, it was an immediate success and 500 units were sold before the summer. It had a 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine rated at 28&nbsp;hp (21&nbsp;kW).<ref name=History>[http://www.volvotrucks.com/trucks/global/en-gb/aboutus/history/Pages/history.aspx]. - Volvo Trucks History. - Retrieved: 2012-01-09</ref>\n\n==Volvo Trucks worldwide==\n\nVolvo cabs are manufactured in the north of Sweden in [[Ume\u00e5]] and in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], while the engines are made in the central town of [[Sk\u00f6vde]].

Some of the smaller factories are jointly owned. Its main parts distribution centre is located in Ghent, Belgium.

Alongside the truck assets of White, Volvo acquired a nationwide distribution network (as White had served as the distributor of Freightliner until 1977).  Prior to the acquisition, White's products included the White Road Boss conventional, the [[White Road Commander|White Road Commander 2]] (COE), the Road Xpeditor 2 (low-COE), the Autocar A-series (tractors with extensive use of aluminium), Autocar DC-series (heavy-duty/severe service), the Autocar Construcktor 2 (heavy-duty/severe-service with a White cab), and Western Star conventional/COE trucks. White also operated plants in Utah, Ohio, and Virginia.\n\nFollowing the 1981 acquisition, Volvo upgraded the designs of White and Autocar product lines.  In 1982, the White Integral Sleeper was introduced, joining the sleeper and passenger cab seamlessly.  In 1983, the Road Boss was replaced by the White Conventional; while retaining the same cab, the hoodline was lowered with a redesigned grille.  In 1985, the Integral Tall Sleeper was developed (the [[Volvo F10, F12, and F16|\"Globetrotter\" sleeper]] of America) as a raised-roof variant of the Integral Sleeper.  In 1987, the White 'Aero' truck was introduced, adopting a lowered hoodline, composite headlamps (shared with the [[Volvo 200 Series|Volvo 240]]), and a flush-mounted grille. In 1988, the WG was introduced, marking the return of a short-hood conventional. The Autocar DK severe-duty line was launched in 1983 and supplemented by the widely admired Autocar AT64F long-haul tractor. In 1988, the DK was replaced by the Autocar ACL and ACM models.

Alongside the truck assets of White, Volvo acquired a nationwide distribution network (as White had served as the distributor of Freightliner until 1977).  Prior to the acquisition, White's products included the White Road Boss conventional, the [[White Road Commander|White Road Commander 2]] (COE), the Road Xpeditor 2 (low-COE), the Autocar A-series (tractors with extensive use of aluminium), Autocar DC-series (heavy-duty/severe service), the Autocar Construcktor 2 (heavy-duty/severe-service with a White cab), and Western Star conventional/COE trucks. White also operated plants in Utah, Ohio, and Virginia.\n\nFollowing the 1981 acquisition, Volvo upgraded the designs of White and Autocar product lines.  In 1982, the White Integral Sleeper was introduced, joining the sleeper and passenger cab seamlessly.  In 1983, the Road Boss was replaced by the White Conventional; while retaining the same cab, the hoodline was lowered with a redesigned grille.  In 1985, the Integral Tall Sleeper was developed (the [[Volvo F10, F12, and F16|\"Globetrotter\" sleeper]] of America) as a raised-roof variant of the Integral Sleeper.  In 1987, the White 'Aero' truck was introduced, adopting a lowered hoodline, composite headlamps (shared with the [[Volvo 200 Series|Volvo 240]]), and a flush-mounted grille. In 1988, the WG was introduced, marking the return of a short-hood conventional. The Autocar DK severe-duty line was launched in 1983 and supplemented by the widely admired Autocar AT64F long-haul tractor. In 1988, the DK was replaced by the Autocar ACL and ACM models. While the AC-series trucks were tough and reliable, they incorporated a number of Volvo components and, for some Autocar loyalists, marked a dilution of the Autocar brand.\n\nIn 1986, Volvo commenced sales of trucks under its own brand in North America, introducing the [[Volvo FL#FE6/7 (North America)|FE-series]] low-cab COEs.

In September 1993, the group began a North American leg, which commenced in [[Quebec City]], Canada. The 50-date tour continued until early December, when it wrapped up in [[Mexico City]]. Later in the month, the band returned to Europe for a short tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland. The five date jaunt began in [[Dublin]] and ended, once again, in London.\n\nThe concerts in [[Barcelona]], [[Li\u00e9vin]] and [[Frankfurt]] were filmed, with the compiled footage issued later that year on a video release entitled ''[[Devotional (video)|Devotional]]''. The video was reissued on DVD in 2004. Additionally, a live album entitled ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion Live]]'' was released in December 1993. The album was a track-by-track live duplicate of ''Songs of Faith and Devotion''. The release featured recordings from the concert in Li\u00e9vin, although two of the tracks were recorded in [[Copenhagen]] and [[New Orleans]] respectively.\n\nThe group continued to promote ''Songs of Faith and Devotion'' the following year on the [[Exotic Tour/Summer Tour '94]], which included an additional North American leg.

The plans for concerts in Central and South America never solidified, however, and the tour covered only the United States and Canada.\n\n==History==\nAfter the departure of [[Mick Taylor]], this was the Rolling Stones' first tour with new guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]]. Announced on 14 April as merely playing with the band on the tour, it would not be until 19 December that he would be officially named a Rolling Stone. Long-time sidemen [[Bobby Keys]] and [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]] on brass were not featured on this tour, being replaced by [[Billy Preston]] on keyboards and [[Ollie E. Brown]] on percussion. Keys made a guest appearance on \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\" and \"[[Brown Sugar (The Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" at the Los Angeles shows.\n\nThe Tour of the Americas '75 was not tied to support of any newly released material, as it began more than seven months after the release of their last studio album at the time, ''[[It's Only Rock'n Roll]]''. Instead, the compilation album ''[[Made in the Shade]]'' was released to capitalise on the tour's publicity.\n\nThe announcement of the tour became famous in itself. On 1 May, reporters were gathered inside the Fifth Avenue Hotel on 9th Street in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] to attend a press conference where the Stones were scheduled to appear. But the Stones never went into the hotel. The handful of curiosity seekers standing outside the hotel \u2013 who'd heard a rumor of the press conference and who were hoping to catch a glimpse of the Stones entering the hotel \u2013 were instead treated to the sight of a [[flatbed truck]] rolling down [[Fifth Avenue]] carrying the Stones, their instruments and a wall of amps. The truck stopped in front of the hotel entrance and the band played an extended version of \"[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcKYHfhtTCg]</ref> [[Charlie Watts]] had suggested this adaptation of a promotional gimmick often used by [[New Orleans]] jazz musicians; the idea was later emulated by groups like [[AC/DC]] and [[U2]]. After the Stones finished the song, the flatbed truck rolled down Fifth Avenue another block and the band jumped into limousines. They never attended the press conference.\n\nThe mid-1970s were the era of extravagant stage shows, from the likes of [[Elton John]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. In keeping with this, the Stones embraced a new format for the 1975 concerts. Their act was aided by theatrical stage props and gimmicks, including a giant inflatable phallus (nicknamed 'Tired Grandfather' by the band, since it sometimes malfunctioned) and, at some shows, an unfolding [[lotus flower]]-shaped stage that Charlie Watts had conceived.\n\nThe tour officially began on 3 June 1975 at the Convention Center in [[San Antonio, Texas]]; however first the group played two warmup shows on 1 June at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. The tour continued, playing mostly arenas in the United States and Canada, including six consecutive nights at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York and five nights at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in Los Angeles. However, a planned Latin American leg in [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], and [[Venezuela]] for the balance of August was cancelled due to a combination of currency fluctuations and security concerns. Four additional US dates were then added, culminating in a final performance on 8 August at [[Rich Stadium]] near [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\nThe 1977 live album ''[[Love You Live]]'' has \"[[Fingerprint File]]\" and \"[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll]]\" from Toronto, 17 June 1975 and \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\" from Los Angeles, 9 July 1975.\n\nIn 2012, the entire show from Los Angeles, 13 July 1975 was released as part of the 'Rolling Stones Archive',<ref>http://www.stonesarchive.com/</ref> mixed and remastered by [[Bob Clearmountain]]. This show was previously available in excellent audience quality on the 'LA Friday' [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]. The title is a reference to a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review of the Friday, 11 July 1975 show, even though the actual featured show was from Sunday, 13 July.\n\n==Personnel==\n===The Rolling Stones===\n*[[Mick Jagger]] \u2013 lead vocals, harmonica, guitar on [[Fingerprint File]]\n*[[Keith Richards]] \u2013 guitars, vocals\n*[[Bill Wyman]] \u2013 bass guitar, synthesizer on [[Fingerprint File]]\n*[[Charlie Watts]] \u2013 drums, percussion\n*[[Ronnie Wood]] \u2013 guitar, bass guitar on [[Fingerprint File]]\n\n===Additional musicians===\n*[[Billy Preston]] \u2013 keyboards, vocals\n*[[Ollie E.

Otherwise, as with their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]], the band's pre-1968 catalogue was almost completely ignored except \"Get Off of My Cloud\", and their [[signature song]] \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" absent.\n\n==Tour dates==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"150\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n!Opening Act\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Tour\n|-\n| 1 June 1975<br/>(2 shows) || [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] || rowspan=\"10\"|United States || [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center|LSU Assembly Center]] || rowspan=\"3\" {{n/a}}\n|- \n| 3 June 1975 || rowspan=\"2\"|[[San Antonio]] || rowspan=\"2\"|[[Henry B.

The plans for concerts in Central and South America never solidified, however, and the tour covered only the United States and Canada.\n\n==History==\nAfter the departure of [[Mick Taylor]], this was the Rolling Stones' first tour with new guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]]. Announced on 14 April as merely playing with the band on the tour, it would not be until 19 December that he would be officially named a Rolling Stone. Long-time sidemen [[Bobby Keys]] and [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]] on brass were not featured on this tour, being replaced by [[Billy Preston]] on keyboards and [[Ollie E. Brown]] on percussion. Keys made a guest appearance on \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\" and \"[[Brown Sugar (The Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" at the Los Angeles shows.\n\nThe Tour of the Americas '75 was not tied to support of any newly released material, as it began more than seven months after the release of their last studio album at the time, ''[[It's Only Rock'n Roll]]''. Instead, the compilation album ''[[Made in the Shade]]'' was released to capitalise on the tour's publicity.\n\nThe announcement of the tour became famous in itself. On 1 May, reporters were gathered inside the Fifth Avenue Hotel on 9th Street in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] to attend a press conference where the Stones were scheduled to appear. But the Stones never went into the hotel. The handful of curiosity seekers standing outside the hotel \u2013 who'd heard a rumor of the press conference and who were hoping to catch a glimpse of the Stones entering the hotel \u2013 were instead treated to the sight of a [[flatbed truck]] rolling down [[Fifth Avenue]] carrying the Stones, their instruments and a wall of amps. The truck stopped in front of the hotel entrance and the band played an extended version of \"[[Brown Sugar (song)|Brown Sugar]]\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcKYHfhtTCg]</ref> [[Charlie Watts]] had suggested this adaptation of a promotional gimmick often used by [[New Orleans]] jazz musicians; the idea was later emulated by groups like [[AC/DC]] and [[U2]]. After the Stones finished the song, the flatbed truck rolled down Fifth Avenue another block and the band jumped into limousines. They never attended the press conference.\n\nThe mid-1970s were the era of extravagant stage shows, from the likes of [[Elton John]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. In keeping with this, the Stones embraced a new format for the 1975 concerts. Their act was aided by theatrical stage props and gimmicks, including a giant inflatable phallus (nicknamed 'Tired Grandfather' by the band, since it sometimes malfunctioned) and, at some shows, an unfolding [[lotus flower]]-shaped stage that Charlie Watts had conceived.\n\nThe tour officially began on 3 June 1975 at the Convention Center in [[San Antonio, Texas]]; however first the group played two warmup shows on 1 June at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. The tour continued, playing mostly arenas in the United States and Canada, including six consecutive nights at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York and five nights at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in Los Angeles. However, a planned Latin American leg in [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], and [[Venezuela]] for the balance of August was cancelled due to a combination of currency fluctuations and security concerns. Four additional US dates were then added, culminating in a final performance on 8 August at [[Rich Stadium]] near [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\nThe 1977 live album ''[[Love You Live]]'' has \"[[Fingerprint File]]\" and \"[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll]]\" from Toronto, 17 June 1975 and \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\" from Los Angeles, 9 July 1975.\n\nIn 2012, the entire show from Los Angeles, 13 July 1975 was released as part of the 'Rolling Stones Archive',<ref>http://www.stonesarchive.com/</ref> mixed and remastered by [[Bob Clearmountain]]. This show was previously available in excellent audience quality on the 'LA Friday' [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]. The title is a reference to a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review of the Friday, 11 July 1975 show, even though the actual featured show was from Sunday, 13 July.\n\n==Personnel==\n===The Rolling Stones===\n*[[Mick Jagger]] \u2013 lead vocals, harmonica, guitar on [[Fingerprint File]]\n*[[Keith Richards]] \u2013 guitars, vocals\n*[[Bill Wyman]] \u2013 bass guitar, synthesizer on [[Fingerprint File]]\n*[[Charlie Watts]] \u2013 drums, percussion\n*[[Ronnie Wood]] \u2013 guitar, bass guitar on [[Fingerprint File]]\n\n===Additional musicians===\n*[[Billy Preston]] \u2013 keyboards, vocals\n*[[Ollie E.

Otherwise, as with their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American Tour]], the band's pre-1968 catalogue was almost completely ignored except \"Get Off of My Cloud\", and their [[signature song]] \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" absent.\n\n==Tour dates==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"150\"| Date\n! width=\"200\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n!Opening Act\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Tour\n|-\n| 1 June 1975<br/>(2 shows) || [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] || rowspan=\"10\"|United States || [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center|LSU Assembly Center]] || rowspan=\"3\" {{n/a}}\n|- \n| 3 June 1975 || rowspan=\"2\"|[[San Antonio]] || rowspan=\"2\"|[[Henry B.

To be sure that the new state university would be located in Missoula, the city's leaders made an agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would stay out of the bidding for the new capital and would support Helena over its leading competitor, [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]]. The cities' bids were supported by the rival \"[[Copper Kings]],\" [[William A. Clark]] and [[Marcus Daly]], respectively.\n\nMissoula won the legislative vote for the new university at the Third Montana Legislative Assembly in February 1893, and it was formally opened in 1895. While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes were temporarily held at nearby Willard School. The South Missoula Land Company, owned by [[A.B. Hammond]], Richard Eddy and Marcus Daly, joined with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus. In June 1898 the cornerstone for [[A.J. Gibson (architect)|A.J.

Franke College of Forestry and Conservation; College of Health Professions and Biomedical Sciences; College of Visual and Performing Arts; Alexander Blewett III UM School of Law; UM College of Business; UM School of Journalism; UM School of Extended and Lifelong Learning; Missoula College and Bitterroot College.\n\nThe Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences is divided into five academic departments and the Institute of Educational Research and Service. In 1914, the University of Montana School of Law became a member of The Association of American Law Schools and in 1923, the School received accreditation from the American Bar Association. The W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation offers five undergraduate majors (Ecosystem Science & Restoration; Forestry; Parks, Tourism & Recreation Management; Resource Conservation; and Wildlife Biology) and five Master's of Science and three PhDs.\n\n===Admissions===\nFor the fall 2017 term, 6,182 students applied to the University of Montana. Ninety-three percent were accepted. The entering freshman class had an average high school [[GPA]] of 3.55, and the middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores were 540-650 for reading and writing, 520-620 for math, while the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] Composite range was 21\u201326.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDS_2014_2015|url=http://www.umt.edu/plan/documents/CDS_2014_2015.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n{{Main|Buildings at the University of Montana}}\n[[File:Grizzly, University (Main) Hall, letter M fall 2011.jpg|thumb|Symbols of the university<!-- of Montana-->]]\n[[File:Green missoula.jpg|thumb|The UM<!--University of Montana--> campus]]\nThe original plan of the campus was designed by one of its first professors, Frederich Scheuch, who called for the central oval to be surrounded by immediate and future university buildings. Although Scheuch's plan called for all building entrances to face the center of the Oval, forming a radiating building pattern, buildings were later constructed with three-story in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style, with [[Hip roof|hipped roofs]] and Spanish green roof tiles.\n\nThe first set of buildings were set up around the oval in 1895. Since that time, various campus plans and architectural styles have been used. Today the campus consists of {{convert|220|acre|ha}} and is bordered to the east by [[Mount Sentinel]] and the north by the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork River]]. The main campus comprises 64 buildings, including nine [[residence hall]]s and various athletic venues, including [[Washington\u2013Grizzly Stadium]], a 26,500-seat football stadium and the Adams Center (formerly, [[Dahlberg Arena]]), a 7,500-seat multi-purpose arena where the university's [[College basketball|basketball]] teams play.\n\nLandmarks include:\n\n;The Oval\nA  {{convert|3|acre|adj=on|spell=in}} swath of grass running east to west, marking the traditional center of the university.  Today it is divided into quadrants by two intersecting brick-laid paths, though originally the oval was solid grass and forbidden to be crossed by students. A double row of trees was planted around the oval on [[Arbor Day]] 1896, but many of the trees have since died and are in the process of being replanted.  The original gravel driveway that once surrounded the Oval has also been replaced by sidewalk. The original master plan of the university called for all buildings to face the center of the oval, but this plan proved difficult and a new plan was created in 1935.\n\nOn the western extreme of the Oval is a life-sized [[grizzly bear]] statue created by ceramic artist and sculptor Rudy Autio in 1969.<ref name=bear>{{cite web|title=Grizzly, (sculpture)|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!325496~!0#focus|work=[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> The&nbsp;bronze statue is {{convert|7|feet}} in height, weighs {{convert|5000|lb|-2}}, and took a year to create.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umt.edu/ncur2010/Conference%20Information/logoinfo.aspx |title=2010 Logo Information \u2013 NCUR 2010 \u2013 The University Of Montana |publisher=Umt.edu |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref>  Many photographs of the university picture the bear with the Oval, University (Main) Hall, and Mount Sentinel's 'M' in the background.\n\n;The \"M\" trail\nA {{convert|3/4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} trail with 13 [[Hairpin turn|switchbacks]], it ascends {{convert|620|ft||adj=pre|vertical}}, from {{convert|3,200|to|3,820|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]], from the university at the base of Mount Sentinel. The trail offers sweeping views of the city below.\n\nThere is debate of when \"The 'M'\" was first placed on Mount Sentinel. Around 1908, members of the Forestry Club forged a zigzag trail up the mountain and students carried up stones to shape the symbol of the University of Montana. Originally made of [[whitewash]]ed rocks and only measuring {{convert|25|ft}} by 25 feet, the very first \"M\" was poorly constructed and ultimately replaced by a wooden \"M\" in 1912, which cost $18. That \"M,\" unlike today's \"M,\" stood upright on the face of Mount Sentinel. A larger wooden version of the \"M\" was built in 1913 and upkeep of the structure was formally charged to each year's freshman class.\n\nWhen the large wooden \"M\" was destroyed by a [[blizzard]] in 1915, an even larger version was constructed of whitewashed [[granite]]. Once again the freshman class was tasked with annual renovation of the symbol, beginning a new tradition. Each year from then on, University of Montana freshmen made the hike up to the \"M\" to apply a fresh coat of whitewash and remove any weeds and grass that had grown in and around the structure.\n\nThe annual tradition ended in 1968 when a {{convert|125|by|100|ft|adj=on}} concrete \"M\" was built at a cost of $4,328. Behind the decision to replace rock with concrete were maintenance issues; with the coming of the 1960s, UM students exhibited waning enthusiasm for the annual trek up the hill and for annual upkeep of the \"M.\"  Although the annual whitewashing went by the wayside, one tradition that lives on today is the lighting of the \"M\" during the University's annual [[Homecoming]] celebration each fall. Originally lit by a group of students on October 9, 1919 following the fall whitewashing, the event was so popular that students have continued to light the \"M\" each year during Homecoming week; special beacons light up the giant letter, welcoming former students back to the University.<ref>[http://www.makeitmissoula.com/2010/07/the-story-of-missoulas-m/ The Story of Missoula's \"M\"]</ref>\n\n;Memorial Row\nOn the north side of campus, 29 [[evergreen|evergreen trees]] stand in two columns forming Memorial Row along what used to be the path of Van Buren Avenue. The trees, running from the corner of the Oval to Eddy Avenue, were planted in 1919 following the end of the [[World War I|Great War]] to honor UM students, alumni, and faculty who died in the war, some to combat and many more to the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza epidemic]]. The trees are ''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'' (Western Yellow Pines or Ponderosa Pine), the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of Montana. Originally, a white T-board stood in front of each tree, with the name of the person whom it honors; in 1925, these were replaced with 35 [[brass]] nameplates atop concrete markers. At the same time, the university added a memorial tablet on a boulder near the edge of the Oval closest to Memorial Row. It lists 21 of the 31 honorees from 1919. By 1925, the university had increased the number of names on the official list to 35, and sometime later, it grew to 37.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umt.edu/memorialrow/ |title=Memorial Row \u2013 Memorial Row \u2013 The University Of Montana |publisher=Umt.edu |date=November 22, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPoints of interest include:\n* [[Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library]]\n* [[Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation]]\n* [[Philip L.

About $149 million comes from the General Funds budget, $108 million from restricted funds, auxiliary funds ($51 million), designated funds ($44 million), and plant funds ($61 million).\n\nOver the past 30 years, state support for higher education has dropped dramatically.  In 1990, the State of Montana provided for 69% of the educational and general funds budget.  It now supports 33% of the general fund or 13% of the university's operating budget.  This decrease in funding has, in part, been made up by the university successfully competing for sponsored research money with a growth from $12 million in 1994 to $88 million in 2017 and salaries as low as 3/5 the national average.<ref>[http://www.umt.edu/self-study2010/reportdocs/Standard6Final.pdf Accreditation 2010 Self-Study Report Standard Seven: Finance]</ref>\n\n===Colleges, schools, and centers===\nThe University of Montana comprises seven colleges and two professional schools:\n\n* College of Humanities and Sciences (1893)\n*[[University of Montana Phyllis J.

The University has competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Big Sky Conference]] since the conference was formed in 1963. From 1924 to 1950, the University of Montana was a member of the [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (precursor to today's [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]).  The University of Montana has an ongoing [[College rivalry|rivalry]] with Montana State University, most notably the cross-state football matchups, known as the \"[[Brawl of the Wild]].\"\n\nPrograms include:\n*[[Montana Grizzlies football]] \u2013 Since the 1990s, the Griz have established themselves as one of the most dominant football teams in both the Big Sky Conference and in the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision]] (known as Division I-AA football before 2006). They won the I-AA national title in 1995 and 2001.\n*[[Montana Grizzlies men's basketball]] \u2013 The men's basketball team has established itself in recent years as a power in the Big Sky, and was the conference representative to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Men's basketball tournament]] in 2005, 2006, 2018, and 2019. At the 2006 tournament, the 12th-seeded Griz upset fifth-seeded [[University of Nevada, Reno]], 87-79, the school's first win in the tournament in 31 years. The Cinderella run ended against the fourth-seeded [[Boston College Eagles]].\n*Montana Grizzlies women's basketball \u2013 The women's basketball team is the most successful team in the Big Sky Conference. The Lady Griz have won 17 conference titles in 25 years, most recently in 2012, and have competed in the NCAA Women's tournament 17 times. The Lady Griz were coached from 1978 to 2016 by [[Robin Selvig]] (Montana, 1974), who had an overall record of 865\u2013286 (.752 winning percentage). Selvig earned his 600th win in just 772 games, the sixth fastest of any NCAA coach (men or women).Selvig finished his career ranked eighth among all women's basketball coaches in victories with 865. Since 2016, the team is coached by former Lady Griz star Shannon Schweyen.\n\nOther intercollegiate sports include men's and women's [[Cross country running|cross country]], women's golf, men's and women's track and field, men's and women's [[Track and field athletics|indoor track and field]], men's and women's tennis, women's volleyball and women's soccer. In 2015 UM added women's softball.\n\n[[Intramural sports]] include men's [[lacrosse]] (won 2007 national championship in their division, MCLA-B) and women's [[lacrosse]], the Alpine Ski Team (went to the national championships in winter 2006), [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], dance and cheer, men's and women's [[ice hockey]], men's soccer, the Woodsman Team, [[rodeo]], the Missoula [[Footbag]] Alliance. [[triathlon]], cycling, [[fencing]], Jesters [[Rugby football|Rugby]], and Betterside Women's Rugby.\n\nThe [[mascot]] of the university is [[Monte (mascot)|Monte]], a Grizzly Bear. In 1897, a live bear cub traveled with UM's football team, then known as the \"Bears\" (the \"Grizzlies\" name was adopted in 1923). Numerous live bear cubs who served as university mascots, first named ''Teddy'', then ''Fessy'' and finally, in the 1960s, ''Cocoa''.

To be sure that the new state university would be located in Missoula, the city's leaders made an agreement with the standing capital of Helena that Missoula would stay out of the bidding for the new capital and would support Helena over its leading competitor, [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]]. The cities' bids were supported by the rival \"[[Copper Kings]],\" [[William A. Clark]] and [[Marcus Daly]], respectively.\n\nMissoula won the legislative vote for the new university at the Third Montana Legislative Assembly in February 1893, and it was formally opened in 1895. While plans for a university campus were progressing, classes were temporarily held at nearby Willard School. The South Missoula Land Company, owned by [[A.B. Hammond]], Richard Eddy and Marcus Daly, joined with the Higgins family in donating land for the new campus. In June 1898 the cornerstone for [[A.J. Gibson (architect)|A.J. Gibson]] designed University Hall was laid and Missoula became \"the University City.\"\n\nFrom 1945 until 1965, the name was changed by the legislature to \"Montana State University,\" while the [[Montana State University|school in Bozeman]] was known as \"Montana State College.\"<ref name=nnformisca>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sZ0zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t-gDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7514%2C65798|work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |title=University of Montana new name for Missoula campus|date=July 1, 1965 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n===Presidents===\n{{Main|Presidents of the University of Montana}}\n\n<timeline>\nDateFormat = yyyy\nImageSize  = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPeriod     = from:1895 till:2020\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea   = right:10 left:20 bottom:50 top:0\n\nColors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7)\n         id:line     value:black\n         id:bg       value:white\n\nPlotData=\n  width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:m\n\n  bar:1  color:powderblue from:1895 shift:(87,-5) till:1908 text:Oscar J.

Franke College of Forestry and Conservation; College of Health Professions and Biomedical Sciences; College of Visual and Performing Arts; Alexander Blewett III UM School of Law; UM College of Business; UM School of Journalism; UM School of Extended and Lifelong Learning; Missoula College and Bitterroot College.\n\nThe Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences is divided into five academic departments and the Institute of Educational Research and Service. In 1914, the University of Montana School of Law became a member of The Association of American Law Schools and in 1923, the School received accreditation from the American Bar Association. The W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation offers five undergraduate majors (Ecosystem Science & Restoration; Forestry; Parks, Tourism & Recreation Management; Resource Conservation; and Wildlife Biology) and five Master's of Science and three PhDs.\n\n===Admissions===\nFor the fall 2017 term, 6,182 students applied to the University of Montana. Ninety-three percent were accepted. The entering freshman class had an average high school [[GPA]] of 3.55, and the middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores were 540-650 for reading and writing, 520-620 for math, while the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] Composite range was 21\u201326.<ref>{{cite web|title=CDS_2014_2015|url=http://www.umt.edu/plan/documents/CDS_2014_2015.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n{{Main|Buildings at the University of Montana}}\n[[File:Grizzly, University (Main) Hall, letter M fall 2011.jpg|thumb|Symbols of the university<!-- of Montana-->]]\n[[File:Green missoula.jpg|thumb|The UM<!--University of Montana--> campus]]\nThe original plan of the campus was designed by one of its first professors, Frederich Scheuch, who called for the central oval to be surrounded by immediate and future university buildings. Although Scheuch's plan called for all building entrances to face the center of the Oval, forming a radiating building pattern, buildings were later constructed with three-story in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style, with [[Hip roof|hipped roofs]] and Spanish green roof tiles.\n\nThe first set of buildings were set up around the oval in 1895. Since that time, various campus plans and architectural styles have been used. Today the campus consists of {{convert|220|acre|ha}} and is bordered to the east by [[Mount Sentinel]] and the north by the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork River]]. The main campus comprises 64 buildings, including nine [[residence hall]]s and various athletic venues, including [[Washington\u2013Grizzly Stadium]], a 26,500-seat football stadium and the Adams Center (formerly, [[Dahlberg Arena]]), a 7,500-seat multi-purpose arena where the university's [[College basketball|basketball]] teams play.\n\nLandmarks include:\n\n;The Oval\nA  {{convert|3|acre|adj=on|spell=in}} swath of grass running east to west, marking the traditional center of the university.  Today it is divided into quadrants by two intersecting brick-laid paths, though originally the oval was solid grass and forbidden to be crossed by students. A double row of trees was planted around the oval on [[Arbor Day]] 1896, but many of the trees have since died and are in the process of being replanted.  The original gravel driveway that once surrounded the Oval has also been replaced by sidewalk. The original master plan of the university called for all buildings to face the center of the oval, but this plan proved difficult and a new plan was created in 1935.\n\nOn the western extreme of the Oval is a life-sized [[grizzly bear]] statue created by ceramic artist and sculptor Rudy Autio in 1969.<ref name=bear>{{cite web|title=Grizzly, (sculpture)|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!325496~!0#focus|work=[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> The&nbsp;bronze statue is {{convert|7|feet}} in height, weighs {{convert|5000|lb|-2}}, and took a year to create.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umt.edu/ncur2010/Conference%20Information/logoinfo.aspx |title=2010 Logo Information \u2013 NCUR 2010 \u2013 The University Of Montana |publisher=Umt.edu |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref>  Many photographs of the university picture the bear with the Oval, University (Main) Hall, and Mount Sentinel's 'M' in the background.\n\n;The \"M\" trail\nA {{convert|3/4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} trail with 13 [[Hairpin turn|switchbacks]], it ascends {{convert|620|ft||adj=pre|vertical}}, from {{convert|3,200|to|3,820|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]], from the university at the base of Mount Sentinel. The trail offers sweeping views of the city below.\n\nThere is debate of when \"The 'M'\" was first placed on Mount Sentinel. Around 1908, members of the Forestry Club forged a zigzag trail up the mountain and students carried up stones to shape the symbol of the University of Montana. Originally made of [[whitewash]]ed rocks and only measuring {{convert|25|ft}} by 25 feet, the very first \"M\" was poorly constructed and ultimately replaced by a wooden \"M\" in 1912, which cost $18. That \"M,\" unlike today's \"M,\" stood upright on the face of Mount Sentinel. A larger wooden version of the \"M\" was built in 1913 and upkeep of the structure was formally charged to each year's freshman class.\n\nWhen the large wooden \"M\" was destroyed by a [[blizzard]] in 1915, an even larger version was constructed of whitewashed [[granite]]. Once again the freshman class was tasked with annual renovation of the symbol, beginning a new tradition. Each year from then on, University of Montana freshmen made the hike up to the \"M\" to apply a fresh coat of whitewash and remove any weeds and grass that had grown in and around the structure.\n\nThe annual tradition ended in 1968 when a {{convert|125|by|100|ft|adj=on}} concrete \"M\" was built at a cost of $4,328. Behind the decision to replace rock with concrete were maintenance issues; with the coming of the 1960s, UM students exhibited waning enthusiasm for the annual trek up the hill and for annual upkeep of the \"M.\"  Although the annual whitewashing went by the wayside, one tradition that lives on today is the lighting of the \"M\" during the University's annual [[Homecoming]] celebration each fall. Originally lit by a group of students on October 9, 1919 following the fall whitewashing, the event was so popular that students have continued to light the \"M\" each year during Homecoming week; special beacons light up the giant letter, welcoming former students back to the University.<ref>[http://www.makeitmissoula.com/2010/07/the-story-of-missoulas-m/ The Story of Missoula's \"M\"]</ref>\n\n;Memorial Row\nOn the north side of campus, 29 [[evergreen|evergreen trees]] stand in two columns forming Memorial Row along what used to be the path of Van Buren Avenue. The trees, running from the corner of the Oval to Eddy Avenue, were planted in 1919 following the end of the [[World War I|Great War]] to honor UM students, alumni, and faculty who died in the war, some to combat and many more to the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza epidemic]]. The trees are ''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'' (Western Yellow Pines or Ponderosa Pine), the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of Montana. Originally, a white T-board stood in front of each tree, with the name of the person whom it honors; in 1925, these were replaced with 35 [[brass]] nameplates atop concrete markers. At the same time, the university added a memorial tablet on a boulder near the edge of the Oval closest to Memorial Row. It lists 21 of the 31 honorees from 1919. By 1925, the university had increased the number of names on the official list to 35, and sometime later, it grew to 37.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umt.edu/memorialrow/ |title=Memorial Row \u2013 Memorial Row \u2013 The University Of Montana |publisher=Umt.edu |date=November 22, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPoints of interest include:\n* [[Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library]]\n* [[Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation]]\n* [[Philip L.

About $149 million comes from the General Funds budget, $108 million from restricted funds, auxiliary funds ($51 million), designated funds ($44 million), and plant funds ($61 million).\n\nOver the past 30 years, state support for higher education has dropped dramatically.  In 1990, the State of Montana provided for 69% of the educational and general funds budget.  It now supports 33% of the general fund or 13% of the university's operating budget.  This decrease in funding has, in part, been made up by the university successfully competing for sponsored research money with a growth from $12 million in 1994 to $88 million in 2017 and salaries as low as 3/5 the national average.<ref>[http://www.umt.edu/self-study2010/reportdocs/Standard6Final.pdf Accreditation 2010 Self-Study Report Standard Seven: Finance]</ref>\n\n===Colleges, schools, and centers===\nThe University of Montana comprises seven colleges and two professional schools:\n\n* College of Humanities and Sciences (1893)\n*[[University of Montana Phyllis J.

The University has competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Big Sky Conference]] since the conference was formed in 1963. From 1924 to 1950, the University of Montana was a member of the [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (precursor to today's [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]).  The University of Montana has an ongoing [[College rivalry|rivalry]] with Montana State University, most notably the cross-state football matchups, known as the \"[[Brawl of the Wild]].\"\n\nPrograms include:\n*[[Montana Grizzlies football]] \u2013 Since the 1990s, the Griz have established themselves as one of the most dominant football teams in both the Big Sky Conference and in the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision]] (known as Division I-AA football before 2006). They won the I-AA national title in 1995 and 2001.\n*[[Montana Grizzlies men's basketball]] \u2013 The men's basketball team has established itself in recent years as a power in the Big Sky, and was the conference representative to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Men's basketball tournament]] in 2005, 2006, 2018, and 2019. At the 2006 tournament, the 12th-seeded Griz upset fifth-seeded [[University of Nevada, Reno]], 87-79, the school's first win in the tournament in 31 years. The Cinderella run ended against the fourth-seeded [[Boston College Eagles]].\n*Montana Grizzlies women's basketball \u2013 The women's basketball team is the most successful team in the Big Sky Conference. The Lady Griz have won 17 conference titles in 25 years, most recently in 2012, and have competed in the NCAA Women's tournament 17 times. The Lady Griz were coached from 1978 to 2016 by [[Robin Selvig]] (Montana, 1974), who had an overall record of 865\u2013286 (.752 winning percentage). Selvig earned his 600th win in just 772 games, the sixth fastest of any NCAA coach (men or women).Selvig finished his career ranked eighth among all women's basketball coaches in victories with 865. Since 2016, the team is coached by former Lady Griz star Shannon Schweyen.\n\nOther intercollegiate sports include men's and women's [[Cross country running|cross country]], women's golf, men's and women's track and field, men's and women's [[Track and field athletics|indoor track and field]], men's and women's tennis, women's volleyball and women's soccer. In 2015 UM added women's softball.\n\n[[Intramural sports]] include men's [[lacrosse]] (won 2007 national championship in their division, MCLA-B) and women's [[lacrosse]], the Alpine Ski Team (went to the national championships in winter 2006), [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], dance and cheer, men's and women's [[ice hockey]], men's soccer, the Woodsman Team, [[rodeo]], the Missoula [[Footbag]] Alliance. [[triathlon]], cycling, [[fencing]], Jesters [[Rugby football|Rugby]], and Betterside Women's Rugby.\n\nThe [[mascot]] of the university is [[Monte (mascot)|Monte]], a Grizzly Bear. In 1897, a live bear cub traveled with UM's football team, then known as the \"Bears\" (the \"Grizzlies\" name was adopted in 1923). Numerous live bear cubs who served as university mascots, first named ''Teddy'', then ''Fessy'' and finally, in the 1960s, ''Cocoa''. UM's costumed mascot during the 1980s, dubbed ''Otto'', donned a variety of fun-loving outfits to entertain crowds at Grizzly football games.

The North American leg constituted band leader [[Paul McCartney]]'s first live performances there since [[the Beatles]]' [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|final tour]], in 1966,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19760421&id=nYQiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=16kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1199,7167766 |title=Sounds: Wings are Flying |date=22 April 1976 |accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> and the only time Wings would perform live in the US and Canada. The world tour was well-attended and critically acclaimed, and resulted in a triple live album, ''[[Wings over America]]'', which [[Capitol Records]] released in December 1976. In addition, the tour was documented in the television film ''[[Wings Over the World]]'' (1979) and a cinema release, ''[[Rockshow]]'' (1980).\n\nThe [[set list]] for much of the tour featured material from Wings' bestselling studios albums ''[[Band on the Run]]'' (1973), ''[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]'' (1975) and ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' (1976), as well as some of McCartney's compositions from the Beatles era, including \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\", \"[[Lady Madonna]]\" and \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\". The inclusion of the latter songs proved especially popular and marked the first time that McCartney had performed material from the Beatles' catalogue in concert since their break-up. Aside from McCartney, the line-up of Wings included his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], [[Denny Laine]], [[Jimmy McCulloch]] and [[Joe English (musician)|Joe English]], together with a brass section led by [[Howie Casey]].\n\n==History==\nIn contrast to [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' low-profile 1972 tours and a 1973 tour of UK theatres, Wings Over the World was a highly publicised concert tour that took place mostly in [[arena]]s and [[stadiums]], and in the American stages of this tour the band's entourage and equipment were transported to each successive venue in five 32-ton trucks.<ref>''McCartney: Songwriter'' {{ISBN|0-491-03325-7}} p. 119</ref> Around 1 million people attended the 66 shows, which were staged in six legs: Britain (September 1975); Australia (November 1975); Europe (March 1976); North America (May\u2013June 1976); a return to Europe (September 1976); and three final concerts at Wembley in London (October 1976). A tour of Japan was planned, but it was cancelled by that country's authorities due to McCartney's 1972 Swedish [[marijuana]] arrest.\n{{quote box\n| quote = We [had] come from very small beginnings after the hugeness of [[the Beatles]]. We'd wanted to start something up, just to continue playing music. Then we'd wanted it to be something cool that was us, that allowed us to be free and experiment. Then we'd wanted to practice and get a really good group ... So we'd finally done all those things. Now, here we were poised to take it out and show off a bit.\n| source = Paul McCartney, reflecting on the Wings Over the World tour, 2001<ref>''Paul McCartney: The Biography'' {{ISBN|978-2-757-87241-3}} p. 183</ref>\n| width = 35em\n}}\nThe world tour followed the release of Wings' bestselling album ''[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]'' (1975), while the follow-up album, ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' (1976), was completed after the band's Australian concerts. Both ''Venus and Mars'' and the critically acclaimed ''[[Band on the Run]]'' (1973) were well represented in the [[setlist]] for the two 1975 legs. Songs from ''Speed of Sound'' were then introduced into the set in March 1976, and McCartney is known to have remarked: \"Everything I have done since The Beatles split has been leading up to this.\"<ref>''McCartney: Songwriter'' {{ISBN|0-491-03325-7}} p. 120</ref>\n\nIn order to demonstrate that Wings was not merely a McCartney showcase, [[Denny Laine]] sang lead vocals on several songs, including \"[[Go Now (song)|Go Now]]\", reprising his vocal from [[the Moody Blues]]' 1965 hit, and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s song \"[[Richard Cory (song)|Richard Cory]]\". [[Jimmy McCulloch]] also sang lead, on his ''Venus and Mars'' composition \"Medicine Jar\". Of particular interest to fans and music critics, McCartney decided to perform five of his songs from the Beatles, thereby overcoming an earlier disinclination to do any at all. Performances of \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" and \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\" used muted horn arrangements in place of their original strings. In the case of the latter song, the new arrangement emphasised McCartney's objections to the version released on ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' in 1970, where, according to McCartney, American producer [[Phil Spector]] had added orchestral and choral parts to the Beatles' 1969 recording without his approval.{{sfn|Miles|2007|p=316}}\n\nWings' line-up for this tour was Paul McCartney (vocals, bass, piano, acoustic guitar), [[Linda McCartney]] (keyboards, backing vocals), Denny Laine (vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, bass, keyboards, percussion), Jimmy McCulloch (electric and acoustic guitars, bass, vocals) and [[Joe English (musician)|Joe English]] (drums, percussion, backing vocals). They were joined by brass and woodwind players [[Howie Casey]], Steve Howard, Thaddeus Richard and Tony Dorsey. A [[documentary film]] of the tour, titled ''[[Wings Over the World]]'', aired on US television in November 1979.\n\n===Wings over America===\nMore than 600,000 people attended Wings' 31 shows in the United States and Canada, held between 3 May and 23 June 1976. In order to reduce the stress of moving their young family around the country during the course of the tour, the McCartneys rented houses in New York City, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles. Each night, they would fly in a specially chartered [[BAC One-Eleven]] to the closest of the four properties.\n\nThe beginning of the American leg of the tour was delayed for nearly a month because lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch broke his finger after slipping when getting out of a bathtub in a Paris hotel. At one of the Los Angeles shows, McCartney's former Beatles bandmate [[Ringo Starr]] joined him on stage and handed him a bouquet of flowers.\n\nMany of the concerts were professionally recorded.

The North American leg constituted band leader [[Paul McCartney]]'s first live performances there since [[the Beatles]]' [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|final tour]], in 1966,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19760421&id=nYQiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=16kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1199,7167766 |title=Sounds: Wings are Flying |date=22 April 1976 |accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> and the only time Wings would perform live in the US and Canada. The world tour was well-attended and critically acclaimed, and resulted in a triple live album, ''[[Wings over America]]'', which [[Capitol Records]] released in December 1976. In addition, the tour was documented in the television film ''[[Wings Over the World]]'' (1979) and a cinema release, ''[[Rockshow]]'' (1980).\n\nThe [[set list]] for much of the tour featured material from Wings' bestselling studios albums ''[[Band on the Run]]'' (1973), ''[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]'' (1975) and ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' (1976), as well as some of McCartney's compositions from the Beatles era, including \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\", \"[[Lady Madonna]]\" and \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\". The inclusion of the latter songs proved especially popular and marked the first time that McCartney had performed material from the Beatles' catalogue in concert since their break-up. Aside from McCartney, the line-up of Wings included his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], [[Denny Laine]], [[Jimmy McCulloch]] and [[Joe English (musician)|Joe English]], together with a brass section led by [[Howie Casey]].\n\n==History==\nIn contrast to [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' low-profile 1972 tours and a 1973 tour of UK theatres, Wings Over the World was a highly publicised concert tour that took place mostly in [[arena]]s and [[stadiums]], and in the American stages of this tour the band's entourage and equipment were transported to each successive venue in five 32-ton trucks.<ref>''McCartney: Songwriter'' {{ISBN|0-491-03325-7}} p. 119</ref> Around 1 million people attended the 66 shows, which were staged in six legs: Britain (September 1975); Australia (November 1975); Europe (March 1976); North America (May\u2013June 1976); a return to Europe (September 1976); and three final concerts at Wembley in London (October 1976). A tour of Japan was planned, but it was cancelled by that country's authorities due to McCartney's 1972 Swedish [[marijuana]] arrest.\n{{quote box\n| quote = We [had] come from very small beginnings after the hugeness of [[the Beatles]]. We'd wanted to start something up, just to continue playing music. Then we'd wanted it to be something cool that was us, that allowed us to be free and experiment. Then we'd wanted to practice and get a really good group ... So we'd finally done all those things. Now, here we were poised to take it out and show off a bit.\n| source = Paul McCartney, reflecting on the Wings Over the World tour, 2001<ref>''Paul McCartney: The Biography'' {{ISBN|978-2-757-87241-3}} p. 183</ref>\n| width = 35em\n}}\nThe world tour followed the release of Wings' bestselling album ''[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]'' (1975), while the follow-up album, ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' (1976), was completed after the band's Australian concerts. Both ''Venus and Mars'' and the critically acclaimed ''[[Band on the Run]]'' (1973) were well represented in the [[setlist]] for the two 1975 legs. Songs from ''Speed of Sound'' were then introduced into the set in March 1976, and McCartney is known to have remarked: \"Everything I have done since The Beatles split has been leading up to this.\"<ref>''McCartney: Songwriter'' {{ISBN|0-491-03325-7}} p. 120</ref>\n\nIn order to demonstrate that Wings was not merely a McCartney showcase, [[Denny Laine]] sang lead vocals on several songs, including \"[[Go Now (song)|Go Now]]\", reprising his vocal from [[the Moody Blues]]' 1965 hit, and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s song \"[[Richard Cory (song)|Richard Cory]]\". [[Jimmy McCulloch]] also sang lead, on his ''Venus and Mars'' composition \"Medicine Jar\". Of particular interest to fans and music critics, McCartney decided to perform five of his songs from the Beatles, thereby overcoming an earlier disinclination to do any at all. Performances of \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" and \"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\" used muted horn arrangements in place of their original strings. In the case of the latter song, the new arrangement emphasised McCartney's objections to the version released on ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' in 1970, where, according to McCartney, American producer [[Phil Spector]] had added orchestral and choral parts to the Beatles' 1969 recording without his approval.{{sfn|Miles|2007|p=316}}\n\nWings' line-up for this tour was Paul McCartney (vocals, bass, piano, acoustic guitar), [[Linda McCartney]] (keyboards, backing vocals), Denny Laine (vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, bass, keyboards, percussion), Jimmy McCulloch (electric and acoustic guitars, bass, vocals) and [[Joe English (musician)|Joe English]] (drums, percussion, backing vocals). They were joined by brass and woodwind players [[Howie Casey]], Steve Howard, Thaddeus Richard and Tony Dorsey. A [[documentary film]] of the tour, titled ''[[Wings Over the World]]'', aired on US television in November 1979.\n\n===Wings over America===\nMore than 600,000 people attended Wings' 31 shows in the United States and Canada, held between 3 May and 23 June 1976. In order to reduce the stress of moving their young family around the country during the course of the tour, the McCartneys rented houses in New York City, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles. Each night, they would fly in a specially chartered [[BAC One-Eleven]] to the closest of the four properties.\n\nThe beginning of the American leg of the tour was delayed for nearly a month because lead guitarist Jimmy McCulloch broke his finger after slipping when getting out of a bathtub in a Paris hotel. At one of the Los Angeles shows, McCartney's former Beatles bandmate [[Ringo Starr]] joined him on stage and handed him a bouquet of flowers.\n\nMany of the concerts were professionally recorded. The best performances would later be compiled, after studio [[overdubbing|overdubs]], for release as the [[triple album]] ''[[Wings over America]]'' in December 1976. In addition, a concert film combining footage from the [[Seattle]], New York and Los Angeles shows was released in cinemas in 1980, as ''[[Rockshow]]'', by [[Miramax Films]].\n\n==Tour setlists==\n{{hidden\n| headercss = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;\n| contentcss = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;\n| header = Average 1975 tour setlist<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/average-setlist/wings-23d68837.html?year=1975 Wings Average Setlists of year: 1975]</ref>\n| content =\n#\"[[Venus and Mars/Rock Show|Venus and Mars]]\"/\"[[Venus and Mars/Rock Show|Rock Show]]\"\n#\"[[Jet (song)|Jet]]\"\n#\"[[Let Me Roll It]]\"\n#\"Spirits of Ancient Egypt\"\n#\"[[Little Woman Love]]\"\n#\"[[C Moon]]\"\n#\"[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]\"\n#\"[[Lady Madonna]]\"\n#\"[[The Long and Winding Road]]\"\n#\"Medicine Jar\"\n#\"[[Picasso's Last Words (Drink to Me)]]\"\n#\"[[Richard Cory (song)|Richard Cory]]\"\n#\"[[Bluebird (Wings (band) song)|Bluebird]]\"\n#\"[[I've Just Seen a Face]]\"\n#\"[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]\"\n#\"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\"\n#\"[[You Gave Me the Answer]]\"\n#\"[[Magneto and Titanium Man]]\"\n#\"[[Go Now (song)|Go Now]]\"\n#\"[[Letting Go (Wings song)|Letting Go]]\"\n#\"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\"\n#\"[[Call Me Back Again]]\"\n#\"[[My Love (Paul McCartney & Wings song)|My Love]]\"\n#\"[[Listen to What the Man Said]]\"\n#\"[[Junior's Farm]]\"\n#\"[[Band on the Run (song)|Band on the Run]]\"\n#\"[[Hi, Hi, Hi]]\"\n#\"[[Soily]]\"\n}} \n{{hidden\n| headercss = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;\n| contentcss = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;\n| header = Average 1976 tour setlist<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/average-setlist/wings-23d68837.html?year=1976 Wings Average Setlists of year: 1976]</ref>\n| content =\n#\"Venus and Mars\"/\"Rock Show\"\n#\"Jet\"\n#\"Let Me Roll It\"\n#\"Spirits of Ancient Egypt\"\n#\"Medicine Jar\"\n#\"Maybe I'm Amazed\"\n#\"Call Me Back Again\"\n#\"Lady Madonna\"\n#\"The Long and Winding Road\"\n#\"Live and Let Die\"\n#\"Picasso's Last Words (Drink to Me)\"\n#\"Richard Cory\"\n#\"Bluebird\"\n#\"[[I've Just Seen a Face]]\"\n#\"[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]\"\n#\"Yesterday\"\n#\"You Gave Me the Answer\"\n#\"Magneto and Titanium Man\"\n#\"Go Now\" (Los Angeles and some shows on the second European leg)\n#\"My Love\"\n#\"Listen to What the Man Said\"\n#\"[[Let 'Em In]]\"\n#\"Time to Hide\"\n#\"[[Silly Love Songs]]\"\n#\"[[Beware My Love]]\"\n#\"Letting Go\"\n#\"Band on the Run\"\n#\"Hi, Hi, Hi\"\n#\"Soily\" (not performed at all shows)\n}}\n\n==Tour dates==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

{"title_page": "Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2018}}\nThe '''Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings''' are a collection of [[music|audio]] and [[video]] recordings of musical performances by the English [[Rock music|rock band]] [[Led Zeppelin]] which were never officially released by the band, or under other legal authority. The recordings consist of both live concert performances and outtakes from studio sessions conducted by the band. Many hundreds of Led Zeppelin bootlegs exist, and are widely collected by fans.\n\n==Overview==\nLed Zeppelin were, throughout the decade of the 1970s, one of the world's most frequently [[bootleg recording|bootlegged]] performers, and to this day remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.<ref name=\"Heylin\">{{cite book|author=Heylin, Clinton|title=Bootleg!

''[[The Independent]]''. Retrieved 25 March 2010.</ref> This phenomenon was due partly to the popularity of the band, which has ensured a large and enthusiastic market for unauthorised recordings, and partly to the large size of the audiences who attended their performances, which made the effective detection of covert recording equipment at these concerts virtually impossible.\n\nLed Zeppelin's manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], sometimes took extraordinary measures to combat the practice of live bootleg recordings at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]]. He is reported to have personally visited record stores in London which were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts so as to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment. At one concert at [[Vancouver]] in 1971 he saw what he thought was recording equipment on the floor of the venue and personally ensured that the equipment be destroyed, only to find out later that the equipment was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130104004337/http://www.ledzeppelin.com/sites/ledzeppelin/files/images/van71_grant.jpg Newspaper clipping on ledzeppelin.com (official site)]</ref> Similarly, at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music 1970|Bath Festival]] in 1970, he personally threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment.<ref name=\"Welch2\">Welch, Chris (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion Books. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, pp. 24, 56.</ref>\n\nThese efforts were not enough to prevent the release of a flood of Led Zeppelin bootlegs from the 1970s onwards. As is explained by Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis:\n\n{{quote|Bootlegs and Led Zeppelin have been synonymous for over three decades. Despite manager Peter Grant's heavy-handedness when dealing with those he caught taping their shows, the band are the most bootlegged act of all time, outstripping even [[The Beatles]], [Bob] [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]], [Bruce] [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] and the [Rolling] [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]]. Their final seven shows in the UK alone (five at [[Earls Court 1975|Earl's Court]] and two at [[Knebworth Festival 1979|Knebworth]]), account for over 100 different releases between them.

[[Keith Moon]] joined in on drum set for \"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\" and the encores.\n|-\n|}\n\n===The 1980s: the release of the soundboards===\n\nIn the late 1980s, the number of available soundboard recordings of Led Zeppelin shows increased significantly as a result of original soundboard tapes being stolen during a burglary at the home of Led Zeppelin guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and later copied for underground release. Also stolen were copies of several rare studio [[out-takes]], which were released under titles such as ''Jennings Farm Blues'' (featuring run-throughs of an electric version of \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" recorded in October 1969) and ''Studio Daze'' (including different studio mixes of \"[[Since I've Been Loving You]]\", \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" and \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\"). \"Midnight Moonlight\", a song later recorded by \"[[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]\", is also available through studio bootlegs.\n\n===The 1990s: the CD era===\nThe 1990s saw a multitude of Led Zeppelin bootlegs become available on the CD format, with limited-edition and higher quality releases being produced in Japan on labels such as [[Tarantura]] and [[Antrabata]]. The most significant 90s label TDOLZ ''(The Diagrams of Led Zeppelin)'' has covered most of the circulating concerts for that period releasing over 100 titles. In 1999, the [[BBC]] reported that the number of Led Zeppelin bootleg titles in circulation exceeded those of [[The Beatles]].\n\nSome notable Led Zeppelin bootlegs released on CD include:\n*\"Don't Mess with Texas\" : Recorded at the Texas international Pop Festival in Dallas on August 31, 1969.\n*''[[Burn Like A Candle]]'' : The complete show from the Los Angeles Forum on June 25, 1972.\n*''Pigeon Blood'' : Recorded at [[Tampa Stadium]], Florida on May 5, 1973.\n*''Knebworth'' : Both of the band's performances at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth Festival]] in August 1979.\n\n===The 2000s and present: Empress Valley soundboard breakthrough===\nNumerous previously uncirculated complete high quality soundboard recordings were released by newly established ''Empress Valley'' label (also referenced as ''Empress Valley Supreme Disc'' or ''EVSD'') which is the semi-successor of retired ''Tarantura.'' While Empress Valley surfaced many of the recordings, some, including \"Working Tapes\" were merely repackages of tapes fans had already surfaced and traded via the Internet. Also, early releases such as the \"Physical Rocket\" DVD were made from sub-par videotapes and were later far surpassed by versions surfaced by fans:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" width=\"90%\"  style=\"padding: 5px; align: center;\"\n|- \n! scope=\"col\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Recording details\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002\n! scope=\"row\"| ''{{sort|Zeppelin Express Physical Rocket|The Zeppelin Express Physical Rocket}}''\n| Earl's Court, London, UK on 25 May 1975; professionally shot live video from that concert was released subsequently on [[DVD]], audio material was reissued two times as ''A Young Person's Guide to Led Zeppelin'' and ''When We Were Kings''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Flying Circus''\n| [[Madison Square Garden]], New York City, US on 12 February 1975\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Florida Sunshine''\n| [[Orlando Sports Stadium]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], US on 31 August 1971\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Bringing the House Down''\n| [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]], [[Landover, Maryland|Landover]], US on 26 May 1977\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Chasing the Dragon''\n| [[Dallas Memorial Auditorium|Memorial Auditorium]], [[Dallas]], US on 4 March 1975; an incomplete soundboard recording of this concert had previously circulated.

As noted above, however, Empress Valley has done its own share of repackaging already existent tapes.\n\n===Bootleg trading on the Web===\nIn the 80s and 90s before [[broadband Internet access]] became widely available, bootlegs ([[CD-R]]s or [[Compact Cassette]] copies) circulated mostly via the mail. Today, all of the unauthorised Led Zeppelin material is available on the Internet, mostly on [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] resources in [[lossless]] media formats.

''[[The Independent]]''. Retrieved 25 March 2010.</ref> This phenomenon was due partly to the popularity of the band, which has ensured a large and enthusiastic market for unauthorised recordings, and partly to the large size of the audiences who attended their performances, which made the effective detection of covert recording equipment at these concerts virtually impossible.\n\nLed Zeppelin's manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], sometimes took extraordinary measures to combat the practice of live bootleg recordings at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]]. He is reported to have personally visited record stores in London which were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts so as to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment. At one concert at [[Vancouver]] in 1971 he saw what he thought was recording equipment on the floor of the venue and personally ensured that the equipment be destroyed, only to find out later that the equipment was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130104004337/http://www.ledzeppelin.com/sites/ledzeppelin/files/images/van71_grant.jpg Newspaper clipping on ledzeppelin.com (official site)]</ref> Similarly, at the [[Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music 1970|Bath Festival]] in 1970, he personally threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment.<ref name=\"Welch2\">Welch, Chris (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion Books. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, pp. 24, 56.</ref>\n\nThese efforts were not enough to prevent the release of a flood of Led Zeppelin bootlegs from the 1970s onwards. As is explained by Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis:\n\n{{quote|Bootlegs and Led Zeppelin have been synonymous for over three decades. Despite manager Peter Grant's heavy-handedness when dealing with those he caught taping their shows, the band are the most bootlegged act of all time, outstripping even [[The Beatles]], [Bob] [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]], [Bruce] [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] and the [Rolling] [[The Rolling Stones|Stones]].

Also stolen were copies of several rare studio [[out-takes]], which were released under titles such as ''Jennings Farm Blues'' (featuring run-throughs of an electric version of \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" recorded in October 1969) and ''Studio Daze'' (including different studio mixes of \"[[Since I've Been Loving You]]\", \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" and \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\"). \"Midnight Moonlight\", a song later recorded by \"[[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]\", is also available through studio bootlegs.\n\n===The 1990s: the CD era===\nThe 1990s saw a multitude of Led Zeppelin bootlegs become available on the CD format, with limited-edition and higher quality releases being produced in Japan on labels such as [[Tarantura]] and [[Antrabata]]. The most significant 90s label TDOLZ ''(The Diagrams of Led Zeppelin)'' has covered most of the circulating concerts for that period releasing over 100 titles. In 1999, the [[BBC]] reported that the number of Led Zeppelin bootleg titles in circulation exceeded those of [[The Beatles]].\n\nSome notable Led Zeppelin bootlegs released on CD include:\n*\"Don't Mess with Texas\" : Recorded at the Texas international Pop Festival in Dallas on August 31, 1969.\n*''[[Burn Like A Candle]]'' : The complete show from the Los Angeles Forum on June 25, 1972.\n*''Pigeon Blood'' : Recorded at [[Tampa Stadium]], Florida on May 5, 1973.\n*''Knebworth'' : Both of the band's performances at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth Festival]] in August 1979.\n\n===The 2000s and present: Empress Valley soundboard breakthrough===\nNumerous previously uncirculated complete high quality soundboard recordings were released by newly established ''Empress Valley'' label (also referenced as ''Empress Valley Supreme Disc'' or ''EVSD'') which is the semi-successor of retired ''Tarantura.'' While Empress Valley surfaced many of the recordings, some, including \"Working Tapes\" were merely repackages of tapes fans had already surfaced and traded via the Internet. Also, early releases such as the \"Physical Rocket\" DVD were made from sub-par videotapes and were later far surpassed by versions surfaced by fans:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" width=\"90%\"  style=\"padding: 5px; align: center;\"\n|- \n! scope=\"col\"|Year\n! scope=\"col\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Recording details\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002\n! scope=\"row\"| ''{{sort|Zeppelin Express Physical Rocket|The Zeppelin Express Physical Rocket}}''\n| Earl's Court, London, UK on 25 May 1975; professionally shot live video from that concert was released subsequently on [[DVD]], audio material was reissued two times as ''A Young Person's Guide to Led Zeppelin'' and ''When We Were Kings''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2002\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Flying Circus''\n| [[Madison Square Garden]], New York City, US on 12 February 1975\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Florida Sunshine''\n| [[Orlando Sports Stadium]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], US on 31 August 1971\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Bringing the House Down''\n| [[Capital Centre]], [[Landover, Maryland|Landover]], US on 26 May 1977\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2003\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Chasing the Dragon''\n| [[Dallas Memorial Auditorium|Memorial Auditorium]], [[Dallas]], US on 4 March 1975; an incomplete soundboard recording of this concert had previously circulated.

As noted above, however, Empress Valley has done its own share of repackaging already existent tapes.\n\n===Bootleg trading on the Web===\nIn the 80s and 90s before [[broadband Internet access]] became widely available, bootlegs ([[CD-R]]s or [[Compact Cassette]] copies) circulated mostly via the mail. Today, all of the unauthorised Led Zeppelin material is available on the Internet, mostly on [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] resources in [[lossless]] media formats. Decoding and redistributing audio in [[lossy]] formats (such as MP3) is strongly frowned upon among the trading community as it diminishes the quality of the audio and can make it difficult for recipients to know if they are receiving the best available copy.
