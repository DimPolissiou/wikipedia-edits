The project was financed by John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company. Construction of the tower was interrupted in 1967 due to a flaw in an innovative engineering method used to pour concrete in stages, that was discovered when the building was 20 stories high.<ref>''Jerry Wolman: The World's Richest Man'', Joseph Bokol, Richard Bokol, 2012</ref> The engineers were getting the same soil settlements for the 20 stories that had been built as what they had expected for the ''entire'' 99 stories. This forced the owner to stop development until the engineering problem could be resolved, resulting in a credit crunch. The situation is similar to the one faced during the construction of 111 West Wacker, then known as the [[Waterview Tower]]. Wolman's bankruptcy resulted in John Hancock taking over the project, which retained the original design, architect, engineer, and main contractor.\n\nThe building's first resident was Ray Heckla, the original building engineer, responsible for the residential floors from 44 to 92. Heckla moved his family in April 1969, before the building was completed.\n\nOn November 11, 1981, [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]], high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate [[Dan Goodwin]], for the purpose of calling attention to the inability to rescue people trapped in the upper floors of skyscrapers, successfully climbed the building's exterior wall. Wearing a wetsuit and using a climbing device that enabled him to ascend the I-beams on the building's side, Goodwin battled repeated attempts by the [[Chicago Fire Department]] to knock him off. Fire Commissioner William Blair ordered Chicago firemen to stop Goodwin by directing a fully engaged fire hose at him and by blasting fire axes through nearby glass from the inside. Fearing for Goodwin's life, Mayor [[Jane Byrne]] intervened and allowed him to continue to the top.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9502EEDC1F39F936A25752C1A967948260 Headliners Higher and Higher Published: 15 November 1981, New York Times]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Willis Tower |url=http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_history_47.asp |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320062017/http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_history_47.asp |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe John Hancock Center is featured in the 1988 film ''[[Poltergeist III]]''.\n\nOn December 18, 1997, comedian [[Chris Farley]] was found dead in his apartment on the 60th floor of the building.<ref name=\"farley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/chris-farley/person/50825/trivia.html|title=Chris Farley: Trivia|accessdate=April 17, 2008|publisher=CNET Networks|work=TV.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohauntings.com/hancock.html|title=Chicago Ghosts|accessdate=April 17, 2008|publisher=Chicago Hauntings Tours}}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 2002, part of a scaffold fell 43 stories after being torn loose by wind gusts around {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} crushing several cars, killing three people in two of them.

This is one of the engineering techniques which the designers used to achieve a record height; the [[tube (structure)|tubular system]] is the structure that keeps the building upright during wind and earthquake loads. This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan. Such original features have allowed 875 North Michigan Avenue to become an architectural icon. It was pioneered by Bangladeshi-American structural civil engineer [[Fazlur Khan]] and chief architect [[Bruce Graham]].\n\nThe interior was remodeled in 1995, adding to the lobby [[travertine]], black granite, and textured [[limestone]] surfaces. The elliptical-shaped plaza outside the building serves as a public oasis with seasonal plantings and a 12-foot (3.7&nbsp;m) waterfall. A band of white lights at the top of the building is visible all over Chicago at night, and changes colors for different events. For example, at Christmas time the colors are green and red. When a Chicago-area sports team goes far in the playoffs, the colors are changed to match that team's colors.\n\nThe building is a member of the [[World Federation of Great Towers]].

The project was financed by John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company. Construction of the tower was interrupted in 1967 due to a flaw in an innovative engineering method used to pour concrete in stages, that was discovered when the building was 20 stories high.<ref>''Jerry Wolman: The World's Richest Man'', Joseph Bokol, Richard Bokol, 2012</ref> The engineers were getting the same soil settlements for the 20 stories that had been built as what they had expected for the ''entire'' 99 stories. This forced the owner to stop development until the engineering problem could be resolved, resulting in a credit crunch. The situation is similar to the one faced during the construction of 111 West Wacker, then known as the [[Waterview Tower]]. Wolman's bankruptcy resulted in John Hancock taking over the project, which retained the original design, architect, engineer, and main contractor.\n\nThe building's first resident was Ray Heckla, the original building engineer, responsible for the residential floors from 44 to 92. Heckla moved his family in April 1969, before the building was completed.\n\nOn November 11, 1981, [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]], high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate [[Dan Goodwin]], for the purpose of calling attention to the inability to rescue people trapped in the upper floors of skyscrapers, successfully climbed the building's exterior wall. Wearing a wetsuit and using a climbing device that enabled him to ascend the I-beams on the building's side, Goodwin battled repeated attempts by the [[Chicago Fire Department]] to knock him off. Fire Commissioner William Blair ordered Chicago firemen to stop Goodwin by directing a fully engaged fire hose at him and by blasting fire axes through nearby glass from the inside. Fearing for Goodwin's life, Mayor [[Jane Byrne]] intervened and allowed him to continue to the top.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9502EEDC1F39F936A25752C1A967948260 Headliners Higher and Higher Published: 15 November 1981, New York Times]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Willis Tower |url=http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_history_47.asp |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320062017/http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_history_47.asp |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe John Hancock Center is featured in the 1988 film ''[[Poltergeist III]]''.\n\nOn December 18, 1997, comedian [[Chris Farley]] was found dead in his apartment on the 60th floor of the building.<ref name=\"farley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/chris-farley/person/50825/trivia.html|title=Chris Farley: Trivia|accessdate=April 17, 2008|publisher=CNET Networks|work=TV.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohauntings.com/hancock.html|title=Chicago Ghosts|accessdate=April 17, 2008|publisher=Chicago Hauntings Tours}}</ref>\n\nOn March 9, 2002, part of a scaffold fell 43 stories after being torn loose by wind gusts around {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} crushing several cars, killing three people in two of them.

This is one of the engineering techniques which the designers used to achieve a record height; the [[tube (structure)|tubular system]] is the structure that keeps the building upright during wind and earthquake loads. This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan. Such original features have allowed 875 North Michigan Avenue to become an architectural icon. It was pioneered by Bangladeshi-American structural civil engineer [[Fazlur Khan]] and chief architect [[Bruce Graham]].\n\nThe interior was remodeled in 1995, adding to the lobby [[travertine]], black granite, and textured [[limestone]] surfaces. The elliptical-shaped plaza outside the building serves as a public oasis with seasonal plantings and a 12-foot (3.7&nbsp;m) waterfall. A band of white lights at the top of the building is visible all over Chicago at night, and changes colors for different events. For example, at Christmas time the colors are green and red. When a Chicago-area sports team goes far in the playoffs, the colors are changed to match that team's colors.\n\nThe building is a member of the [[World Federation of Great Towers]].
