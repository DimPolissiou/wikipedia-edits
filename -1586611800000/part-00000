Duan's reign was marred by the power struggles within the influential Gao family, whose power had long eclipsed the ruling Duan family.\n\n==Reign==\nIn 1173, Duan sent a party of 23 envoys, led by Li Guanyinde (\u674e\u89c0\u97f3\u5f97), to trade with the [[Song dynasty]] in Hengshan Fort (\u6a6b\u5c71\u7826; in present-day [[Nanning]], [[Guangxi]]). Li later removed Gao Shouchang (\u9ad8\u58fd\u660c), the Duke of Zhong (\u4e2d\u570b\u516c), from power and replaced him with Gao Zhenming (\u9ad8\u8c9e\u660e; Gao Shouchang's nephew). \n\nAji (\u963f\u6a5f) rebelled and ousted Gao Zhenming, restoring Gao Shouchang back in his duke position. Gao Zhenming then occupied Heqing (\u9db4\u6176) and proclaimed himself the Duke of Ming (\u660e\u570b\u516c) and gave himself a [[temple name]], effectively declaring independence from the Kingdom of Dali. Another member of the Gao clan, Gao Miaoyin (\u9ad8\u5999\u97f3), also rebelled in Baiya (\u767d\u5d16) and occupied Shanchan (\u912f\u95e1). \n\nHe made a pact with his nephews, Gao Chengxian (\u9ad8\u6210\u8ce2) and Gao Chengzheng (\u9ad8\u6210\u6b63), to prevent them from taking over Shanchan. However, Gao's nephews betrayed him later and started a war with their uncle. It is unknown if these developments had any long term consequences.\n\nDuan initiated several construction projects in Dali. Being a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] like his predecessors, he repaired 16 Buddhist temples in 1190. In 1195, he ordered the building of defensive infrastructure at crucial entry points into Dali. Five years later, he died and was succeeded by his son, [[Duan Zhilian]] (\u6bb5\u667a\u5ec9).\n\n==Era names==\nDuan Zhixing had five [[era name]]s in the twenty-eight years of his reign.\n*Lizhen (\u5229\u8c9e; 1172\u20131175)\n*Shengde (\u76db\u5fb7; 1176\u20131180)\n*Jiahui (\u5609\u6703; 1181\u20131184)\n*Yuanheng (\u5143\u4ea8; 1185\u20131196?)\n*Anding (\u5b89\u5b9a; 1197\u20131200)\n\n==In fiction==\n{{main|Duan Zhixing (Jin Yong character)}}\nDuan is fictionalised as a character in the [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' and its sequel, ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'', by [[Jin Yong]].

See [http://wiki.zupulu.com/topic.php?action=resumesview&topicid=979 ].</ref> ruler of the [[Kingdom of Dali]] (present-day [[Yunnan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]) between 1172 and 1200. Duan's reign was marred by the power struggles within the influential Gao family, whose power had long eclipsed the ruling Duan family.\n\n==Reign==\nIn 1173, Duan sent a party of 23 envoys, led by Li Guanyinde (\u674e\u89c0\u97f3\u5f97), to trade with the [[Song dynasty]] in Hengshan Fort (\u6a6b\u5c71\u7826; in present-day [[Nanning]], [[Guangxi]]). Li later removed Gao Shouchang (\u9ad8\u58fd\u660c), the Duke of Zhong (\u4e2d\u570b\u516c), from power and replaced him with Gao Zhenming (\u9ad8\u8c9e\u660e; Gao Shouchang's nephew). Aji (\u963f\u6a5f) rebelled and ousted Gao Zhenming, restoring Gao Shouchang back in his duke position. Gao Zhenming then occupied Heqing (\u9db4\u6176) and proclaimed himself the Duke of Ming (\u660e\u570b\u516c) and gave himself a [[temple name]], effectively declaring independence from the Kingdom of Dali. Another member of the Gao clan, Gao Miaoyin (\u9ad8\u5999\u97f3), also rebelled in Baiya (\u767d\u5d16) and occupied Shanchan (\u912f\u95e1). He made a pact with his nephews, Gao Chengxian (\u9ad8\u6210\u8ce2) and Gao Chengzheng (\u9ad8\u6210\u6b63), to prevent them from taking over Shanchan. However, Gao's nephews betrayed him later and started a war with their uncle. It is unknown if these developments had any long term consequences.\n\nDuan initiated several construction projects in Dali. Being a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] like his predecessors, he repaired 16 Buddhist temples in 1190. In 1195, he ordered the building of defensive infrastructure at crucial entry points into Dali. Five years later, he died and was succeeded by his son, [[Duan Zhilian]] (\u6bb5\u667a\u5ec9).\n\n==Era names==\nDuan Zhixing had five [[era name]]s in the twenty-eight years of his reign.\n*Lizhen (\u5229\u8c9e; 1172\u20131175)\n*Shengde (\u76db\u5fb7; 1176\u20131180)\n*Jiahui (\u5609\u6703; 1181\u20131184)\n*Yuanheng (\u5143\u4ea8; 1185\u20131196?)\n*Anding (\u5b89\u5b9a; 1197\u20131200)\n\n==In fiction==\n{{main|Duan Zhixing (Jin Yong character)}}\nDuan is fictionalised as a character in the [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' and its sequel, ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]'', by [[Jin Yong]].
