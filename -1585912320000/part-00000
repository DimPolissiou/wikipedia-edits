At the same time for the amateur championship registered a new club from Khmelnytskyi, ''[[FC Dynamo Khmelnytskyi|FC Podillia-Khmelnytskyi Khmelnytskyi]]''. So, since spring 2007 there were two clubs Podillia, one at professional level playing in Krasyliv and other - amateur playing in Khmelnytskyi.

He was also elected to the [[New York State Senate]] in 1867, but Tweed's greatest influence came from being an appointed member of a number of boards and commissions, his control over political [[patronage]] in New York City through Tammany, and his ability to ensure the loyalty of voters through jobs he could create and dispense on city-related projects.\n\nTweed was convicted for stealing an amount estimated by an aldermen's committee in 1877 at between $25&nbsp;million and $45&nbsp;million from New York City taxpayers through political corruption, although later estimates ranged as high as $200&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20050704/202/1467 \"Boss Tweed\"], ''Gotham Gazette'', New York, July 4, 2005.</ref> Unable to make bail, he escaped from jail once, but was returned to custody.

Tweed was a member of Palestine Lodge No. 204, New York City, Grand Lodge of Masons New York State.</ref> and joined a volunteer fire company, Engine No. 12.<ref name=encnyc /> In 1848, at the invitation of state assemblyman John J. Reilly, he and some friends organized the Americus Fire Company No. 6, also known as the \"Big Six\", as a [[volunteer fireman|volunteer fire company]], which took as its symbol a snarling red [[Bengal tiger]] from a French lithograph<ref name=\"allen\"/>, a symbol which remained associated with Tweed and [[Tammany Hall]] for many years.<ref name= encnyc /> At the time, volunteer fire companies competed vigorously with each other; some were connected with street gangs and had strong ethnic ties to various immigrant communities.  The competition could become so fierce, that burning buildings would sometimes be ignored as the fire companies fought each other.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 654, 724, 823.</ref> Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew. However, fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, thus Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward. The Seventh Ward put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26.  He lost that election to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Morgan Morgans]], but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p. 823.</ref> Tweed then became associated with the [[Tammany Hall#Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves|\"Forty Thieves\"]], the group of aldermen and assistant aldermen who, up to that point, were known as some of the most corrupt politicians in the city's history.<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nTweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, but his two-year term was undistinguished.<ref name=gotham837>Burrows & Wallace, p. 837.</ref> In an attempt by Republican reformers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up. The board had 12 members, six appointed by the mayor and six elected, and in 1858 Tweed was appointed to the board, which became his first vehicle for large-scale [[Graft (politics)|graft]]; Tweed and other supervisors forced vendors to pay a 15% overcharge to their \"ring\" in order to do business with the city.<ref name=gotham837 /> By 1853, Tweed was running the seventh ward for Tammany.<ref name=encnyc /> The board also had six Democrats and six Republicans, but Tweed often just bought off one Republican to sway the board. One such Republican board member was Peter P. Voorhis, a coal dealer by profession who absented himself from a board meeting in exchange for $2,500 so that the board could appoint city inspectors.

His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[John T. Hoffman]], the former mayor of the city, won election as governor, and Tweed garnered the support of good government reformers like [[Peter Cooper]] and the [[Union League Club]], by proposing a new city charter which returned power to City Hall at the expense of the Republican-inspired state commissions. The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870.  Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.<ref name=gotham927>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 927\u2013928.</ref><ref name=History.com/>\n\nThe new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Audit, which consisted of Tweed, who was Commissioner of Public Works, Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]] and Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Richard \"Slippery Dick\" Connolly]], both Tammany men. Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Peter B.

In the words of [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], \"their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar.\"<ref>Paine, p. 143.</ref> Crucially, the new city charter allowed the Board of Audit to issue bonds for debt in order to finance opportunistic capital expenditures the city otherwise could not afford. This ability to float debt was enabled by Tweed's guidance and passage of the Adjusted Claims Act in 1868.<ref>Allen, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref> Contractors working for the city&nbsp;\u2013 \"Ring favorites, most of them&nbsp;\u2013 were told to multiply the amount of each bill by five, or ten, or a hundred, after which, with Mayor Hall's 'O.

Ingersoll and Andrew Garvey, city contractors involved with much of the city construction.]]\n\nTweed and his friends also garnered huge profits from the development of the Upper East Side, especially [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]] and [[Harlem]]. They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area\u2014for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the [[Croton Aqueduct]]\u2014thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits. The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the [[topography]] of which made it more expensive to improve. The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90&nbsp;million.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 929\u2013931.</ref>\n\nDuring the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and [[Brooklyn]], then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to Brooklyn's further development. In order to ensure that the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] project would go forward, State Senator [[Henry Cruse Murphy]] approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor [[William C. Kingsley]] put up the cash, which was delivered in a [[carpet bag]].  Tweed and two others from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 934\u2013935.</ref>\n\nTweed bought a mansion on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[43rd Street (Manhattan)|43rd Street]], and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]]. By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company.  He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Scandal==\nTweed's downfall began in 1871. James Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Dick Connolly]]'s office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] provided city accounts to O'Brien.<ref>Allen, pp. 118\u2013125.</ref> The [[Orange riots|Orange riot of 1871]] in the Summer did not help the ring's popularity. The riot was prompted after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating a historical victory against Catholicism. The parade was banned because of a riot the previous year in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish Catholic laborers attacked the paraders. Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from [[NYPD|city policemen]] and [[New York State National Guard|state militia]]. The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\">Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1003\u20131008.</ref>\n\nAlthough Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of its people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\"/>\n\n[[File:Boss Tweed, Nast.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Nast shows Tweed's source of power: control of the ballot box. \"As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to do about it?\"]]\n\nTweed had for months been under attack from ''The New York Times'' and [[Thomas Nast]], the cartoonist from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''&nbsp;\u2013 regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, \"Stop them damned pictures.

They were able to force an examination of the city's books, but the blue-ribbon commission of six businessmen appointed by Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]], a Tammany man, which included [[John Jacob Astor III]], banker [[Moses Taylor]] and others who benefited from Tammany's actions, found that the books had been \"faithfully kept\", letting the air out of the effort to dethrone Tweed.<ref name=g1008>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1008\u20131011.</ref>\n\nThe response to the Orange riot changed everything, and only days afterwards the ''Times''/Nast campaign began to garner popular support.<ref name=g1008 /> More important, the ''Times'' started to receive inside information from County Sheriff James O'Brien, whose support for Tweed had fluctuated during Tammany's reign. O'Brien had tried to [[blackmail]] Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's [[embezzlement]] to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the ''Times''.<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\">Ellis, pp. 347\u2013348.</ref> Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the ''Times'',<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\" /> which was reportedly offered $5&nbsp;million to not publish the evidence.<ref>Paine, p. 170.</ref> The ''Times'' also obtained the accounts of the recently deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined \"Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed\".<ref name=g1008 /> In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nThe expos\u00e9 provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts. European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management \u2013 only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities. New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nThus, the city's elite met at [[Cooper Union]] in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bigwigs such as [[Samuel J. Tilden]], who had been thrust aside by Tammany. The consensus was that the \"wisest and best citizens\" should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence. The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as \"the [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]]\"), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge\u2014Tweed's old friend George Barnard\u2014enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money. Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching to City Hall demanding to be paid.  Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse\u2014$50,000\u2014but it was not sufficient to end the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nShortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing [[Andrew Haswell Green]], an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement. Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket. The following day, they had Tweed arrested.<ref name=g1008 />\n\n==Imprisonment, escape, and death==\n[[File:Thomas Nast, Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make cph.3a00899.jpg|thumb|\"Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make\": Editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] predicting Tweed could not be kept behind bars (''Harper's Weekly'', January 6, 1872)<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0106.html |title=On This Day: January 6, 1872 |website=The New York Times |access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nTweed was released on $1&nbsp;million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box. Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas. Tweed was re-arrested, forced to resign his city positions, and was replaced as Tammany's leader.

Ackerman]]:<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn depictions of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, along with lining his own pockets and those of his friends and allies. The theme is that the sins of corruption so violated American standards of political rectitude that they far overshadow Tweed's positive contributions to New York City.\n\nAlthough he held numerous important public offices and was one of a handful of senior leaders of Tammany Hall, as well as the state legislature and the state Democratic Party,<ref name=History.com/> Tweed was never the sole \"boss\" of New York City. He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the [[Progressive Era]] in terms of more efficient city management.  Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine. As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals. With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the [[King James Bible]] in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics. He facilitated the founding of the [[New York Public Library]], even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.<ref>Mandelbaum, Seymour J. ''Boss Tweed's New York'' (1965).</ref><ref>Muccigrosso, Robert ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 1538\u201342.</ref>\n\nTweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.<ref name=encnyc /> Tweed also fought for the [[New York State Legislature]] to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize [[Catholic schools]] and hospitals. From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined.<ref>Ackerman, p. 66.</ref> Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of [[corporal punishment]] in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers.\n\nDuring Tweed's regime, the main business thoroughfare Broadway was widened between [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], land was secured for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Upper East Side]] and [[Upper West Side]] were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure \u2013 all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Leo Hershkowitz]] in ''Tweed's New York: Another Look'', there is no evidence of any personal financial gain on Tweed's part, despite the implications of Thomas Nast in ''Harper's Weekly'' and the editors of ''The New York Times'', which both had ties to the  Republican party. In part, the campaign against Tweed diverted public attention from Republican scandals such as the [[Whiskey Ring]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hershkowitz|first=Leo|title=Tweed's New York: Another Look|date=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\nTweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: \"Statues are not erected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come.\"<ref name=encnyc /> One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become \"the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss\".<ref name=encnyc />\n\n[[Image:Boss tweed.jpg|thumb|right|225px|An 1869 cigar box label featuring Tweed]]\n\n==Middle name==\nTweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain \"M.\", and his middle name is often mistakenly listed as \"Marcy\".

The competition could become so fierce, that burning buildings would sometimes be ignored as the fire companies fought each other.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 654, 724, 823.</ref> Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew, but fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, and Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward, who put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26.  He lost that election to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Morgan Morgans]], but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p. 823.</ref> Tweed then became associated with the [[Tammany Hall#Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves|\"Forty Thieves\"]], the group of aldermen and assistant aldermen who, up to that point, were known as some of the most corrupt politicians in the city's history.<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nTweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, but his two-year term was undistinguished.<ref name=gotham837>Burrows & Wallace, p. 837.</ref> In an attempt by Republican reformers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up.

One such Republican board member was Peter P. Voorhis, a coal dealer by profession who absented himself from a board meeting in exchange for $2,500 so that the board could appoint city inspectors.

Accompanying him in his rooms were his favorite canaries.

In return, Tweed received a large block of stock and was made a director of the company.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Corruption==\nAfter the election of 1869, Tweed took control of the New York City government.  His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[John T. Hoffman]], the former mayor of the city, won election as governor, and Tweed garnered the support of good government reformers like [[Peter Cooper]] and the [[Union League Club]], by proposing a new city charter which returned power to City Hall at the expense of the Republican-inspired state commissions. The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870.  Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.<ref name=gotham927>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 927\u2013928.</ref><ref name=History.com/>\n\nThe new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Audit, which consisted of Tweed, who was Commissioner of Public Works, Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]] and Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Richard \"Slippery Dick\" Connolly]], both Tammany men. Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Peter B.

In the words of [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], \"their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar.\"<ref>Paine, p. 143.</ref> Crucially, the new city charter allowed the Board of Audit to issue bonds for debt in order to finance opportunistic capital expenditures the city otherwise could not afford. This ability to float debt was enabled by Tweed's guidance and passage of the Adjusted Claims Act in 1868.<ref>Allen, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref> Contractors working for the city&nbsp;\u2013 \"Ring favorites, most of them&nbsp;\u2013 were told to multiply the amount of each bill by five, or ten, or a hundred, after which, with Mayor Hall's 'O.

They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area\u2014for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the [[Croton Aqueduct]]\u2014thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits. The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the [[topography]] of which made it more expensive to improve. The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90&nbsp;million.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 929\u2013931.</ref>\n\nDuring the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and [[Brooklyn]], then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to Brooklyn's further development. In order to ensure that the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] project would go forward, State Senator [[Henry Cruse Murphy]] approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor [[William C. Kingsley]] put up the cash, which was delivered in a [[carpet bag]].  Tweed and two others from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 934\u2013935.</ref>\n\nTweed bought a mansion on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[43rd Street (Manhattan)|43rd Street]], and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]]. By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company.  He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Scandal==\nTweed's downfall began in 1871. James Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Dick Connolly]]'s office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] provided city accounts to O'Brien.<ref>Allen, pp. 118\u2013125.</ref> The [[Orange riots|Orange riot of 1871]] in the Summer did not help the ring's popularity. The riot was prompted after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating a historical victory against Catholicism. The parade was banned because of a riot the previous year in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish Catholic laborers attacked the paraders. Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from [[NYPD|city policemen]] and [[New York State National Guard|state militia]]. The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\">Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1003\u20131008.</ref>\n\nAlthough Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of its people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\"/>\n\n[[File:Boss Tweed, Nast.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Nast shows Tweed's source of power: control of the ballot box. \"As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to do about it?\"]]\n\nTweed had for months been under attack from ''The New York Times'' and [[Thomas Nast]], the cartoonist from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''&nbsp;\u2013 regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, \"Stop them damned pictures.

They were able to force an examination of the city's books, but the blue-ribbon commission of six businessmen appointed by Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]], a Tammany man, which included [[John Jacob Astor III]], banker [[Moses Taylor]] and others who benefited from Tammany's actions, found that the books had been \"faithfully kept\", letting the air out of the effort to dethrone Tweed.<ref name=g1008>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1008\u20131011.</ref>\n\nThe response to the Orange riot changed everything, and only days afterwards the ''Times''/Nast campaign began to garner popular support.<ref name=g1008 /> More important, the ''Times'' started to receive inside information from County Sheriff James O'Brien, whose support for Tweed had fluctuated during Tammany's reign. O'Brien had tried to [[blackmail]] Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's [[embezzlement]] to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the ''Times''.<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\">Ellis, pp. 347\u2013348.</ref> Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the ''Times'',<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\" /> which was reportedly offered $5&nbsp;million to not publish the evidence.<ref>Paine, p. 170.</ref> The ''Times'' also obtained the accounts of the recently deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined \"Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed\".<ref name=g1008 /> In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nThe expos\u00e9 provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts. European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management \u2013 only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities. New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nThus, the city's elite met at [[Cooper Union]] in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bigwigs such as [[Samuel J. Tilden]], who had been thrust aside by Tammany. The consensus was that the \"wisest and best citizens\" should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence. The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as \"the [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]]\"), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge\u2014Tweed's old friend George Barnard\u2014enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money. Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching to City Hall demanding to be paid.  Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse\u2014$50,000\u2014but it was not sufficient to end the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nShortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing [[Andrew Haswell Green]], an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement. Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket. The following day, they had Tweed arrested.<ref name=g1008 />\n\n==Imprisonment, escape, and death==\n[[File:Thomas Nast, Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make cph.3a00899.jpg|thumb|\"Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make\": Editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] predicting Tweed could not be kept behind bars (''Harper's Weekly'', January 6, 1872)<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0106.html |title=On This Day: January 6, 1872 |website=The New York Times |access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nTweed was released on $1&nbsp;million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box. Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas. Tweed was re-arrested, forced to resign his city positions, and was replaced as Tammany's leader.

Ackerman]]:<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn depictions of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, along with lining his own pockets and those of his friends and allies. The theme is that the sins of corruption so violated American standards of political rectitude that they far overshadow Tweed's positive contributions to New York City.\n\nAlthough he held numerous important public offices and was one of a handful of senior leaders of Tammany Hall, as well as the state legislature and the state Democratic Party,<ref name=History.com/> Tweed was never the sole \"boss\" of New York City. He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the [[Progressive Era]] in terms of more efficient city management.  Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine. As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals. With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the [[King James Bible]] in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics. He facilitated the founding of the [[New York Public Library]], even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.<ref>Mandelbaum, Seymour J. ''Boss Tweed's New York'' (1965).</ref><ref>Muccigrosso, Robert ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 1538\u201342.</ref>\n\nTweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.<ref name=encnyc /> Tweed also fought for the [[New York State Legislature]] to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize [[Catholic schools]] and hospitals. From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined.<ref>Ackerman, p. 66.</ref> Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of [[corporal punishment]] in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers.\n\nDuring Tweed's regime, the main business thoroughfare Broadway was widened between [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], land was secured for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Upper East Side]] and [[Upper West Side]] were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure \u2013 all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Leo Hershkowitz]] in ''Tweed's New York: Another Look'', there is no evidence of any personal financial gain on Tweed's part, despite the implications of Thomas Nast in ''Harper's Weekly'' and the editors of ''The New York Times'', which both had ties to the  Republican party. In part, the campaign against Tweed diverted public attention from Republican scandals such as the [[Whiskey Ring]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hershkowitz|first=Leo|title=Tweed's New York: Another Look|date=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\nTweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: \"Statues are not erected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come.\"<ref name=encnyc /> One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become \"the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss\".<ref name=encnyc />\n\n[[Image:Boss tweed.jpg|thumb|right|225px|An 1869 cigar box label featuring Tweed]]\n\n==Middle name==\nTweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain \"M.\", and his middle name is often mistakenly listed as \"Marcy\". His actual middle name was \"Magear\", his mother's maiden name; Tweed's son's name was William Magear Tweed Jr. The confusion derives from a Nast cartoon with a picture of Tweed, supplemented with a quote from [[William L.

Along with ''hizmet,'' the movement, which has no official name, is termed the G\u00fclen movement or ''[[cemaat]]'' (the latter also used to describe participants in [[Sufi]] orders, meaning \"congregation,\" \"community,\" or \"assembly.\")The movement has been characterized as a \"moderate blend of Islam\".<ref name=nyt080504>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/world/asia/04islam.html?ex=1367640000&en=625b88103a702f94&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink |  first=Sabrina | last=Tavernise | authorlink=Sabrina Tavernise | title=Turkish Schools Offer Pakistan a Gentler Vision of Islam | date=4 May 2008 | work=New York Times}}</ref><ref name=tavernise>{{cite web|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/podcasts/2008/04/25/25worldview.mp3|title=Interview with Sabrina Tavernise, World View Podcasts, New York Times, May 4, 2008}}</ref> G\u00fclen and the G\u00fclen movement are technology-friendly, work within current market and commerce structures, and are savvy users of modern communications and public relations.<ref name=prospect>Ehsan Masood, [http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/amodernottoman A modern Ottoman], ''Prospect'', Issue 148, July 2008</ref> In 2008, G\u00fclen was described as \"the modern face of the Sufi Ottoman tradition\", who reassures his followers, including many members of \"Turkey's aspirational middle class\", that \"they can combine the statist-nationalist beliefs of Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s republic with a traditional but flexible Islamic faith\" and \"Ottoman traditions that had been caricatured as theocratic by [[Atat\u00fcrk]] and his '[[Kemalist]]' heirs\".<ref name=prospect/>\n\nWithin Turkey the G\u00fclen movement keeps its distance from established Islamic political parties.<ref>Clement M.
