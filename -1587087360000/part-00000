Traditionally, seppuku involved the slashing open of one's stomach with a sword. The purpose of this was to release the Samurai's spirit upon the enemy and thus avoid dishonorable execution and probable torture at the hand of an enemy.

These pacts, which are popularly referred to as \"Internet group suicide\", are formed with the intention of all individuals meeting to die by suicide at the same time, by the same method.<ref name=\"naito\"/>\n\nWhile the concept of group suicide also has a historical presence in Japanese culture, traditional shinj\u016b differs from modern Internet group suicide because it occurred among lovers or family members rather than among strangers. Another difference is that mutual consent from those who die by historical shinj\u016b was not required. In other words, certain forms of shinj\u016b might be considered \"murder-suicide\" in Western cultures rather than suicide. An example of this type of shinj\u016b would be a mother killing her children and then killing herself.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva2\" />\n\nAn example of historical shinj\u016b in Japanese literature can be found in [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]]'s puppet play from 1703 entitled Sonezaki Shinjuu (\"The Love Suicides at Sonezaki\"), which was later re-engineered for the kabuki theater. The inspiration for the play was an actual [[Shinj\u016b|double suicide]] which had then recently occurred between two forbidden lovers.<ref name=Keene>{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110980/Chikamatsu-Monzaemon|title=Chikamatsu Monzaemon|last=Keene|first=Donald|date= 30 April 2013|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=2014-11-24}}</ref>\n\nThese modern shinj\u016b have not received the same level of tolerance or social acceptability as an honor suicide (seppuku or hara-kiri) from the Japanese media. Internet group suicide has generally been portrayed as a thoughtless and impulsive act by the media because it seems that there is no compelling reason for why individuals enter into such pacts. In contrast, seppuku serves a specific function; to preserve honor rather than die at the hand of an enemy.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" /> However, this perception has been challenged by research on Internet group suicide by Ozawa de-Silva, who argues that these deaths are \"characterized by severe existential suffering, a loss of the \"worth of living\" ([[ikigai]])...and a profound loneliness and lack of connection with others\".<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" />\n\nOverall, modern public concern about Japan's increasing suicide rate has tended to focus on suicide as a social issue rather than a public health concern. The distinction here is that Japanese culture emphasizes maladjustment into society and social factors as playing a larger role in an individual's decision to commit suicide than an individual psychopathology that is biological in nature.<ref name=\"ueno\"/> Furthermore, stigma surrounding mental health care still exists in Japan.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" /> Thus, there has been more emphasis on reforming social programs that contribute to economic stability (i.e. welfare) rather than creating specific mental health services.\n\nAccording to The New Yorker, \"by tradition, a mother who killed herself but not her children was thought to be truly wicked.\"<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/last-call-3</ref>{{Better source|reason=The tertiary source does not provide other sources or data to support statement on Japanese traditions.|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Government response==\nIn 2007, the government released a nine-step plan, a \"counter-suicide [[White paper|White Paper]]\", which it hopes will curb suicide by 20% by 2017.<ref name=\"Times govt whitepaper\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2852762.ece|title=90 suicides a day spur Japan into action|last=Lewis|first=Leo|date=12 November 2007|newspaper= The Times|accessdate=2008-09-23}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The goal of the white paper is to encourage investigation of the root causes of suicide in order to prevent it, change cultural attitudes toward suicide, and improve treatment of unsuccessful suicides.<ref name=\"Times govt whitepaper\"/> In 2009, the Japanese government committed 15.8 billion yen towards suicide prevention strategies.\n\nJapan has allotted 12.4 billion yen ($133 million) in suicide prevention assets for the 2010 fiscal year ending March 2011, with plans to fund public counseling for those with overwhelming debts and those needing treatment for depression.<ref name=APW/>\n\nAmid the overall increase in self-inflicted death for 2009, the government claims there have been encouraging signs since September.

The purpose of this was to release the Samurai's spirit upon the enemy and thus avoid dishonorable execution and probable torture at the hand of an enemy.

These pacts, which are popularly referred to as \"Internet group suicide\", are formed with the intention of all individuals meeting to die by suicide at the same time, by the same method.<ref name=\"naito\"/>\n\nWhile the concept of group suicide also has a historical presence in Japanese culture, traditional shinj\u016b differs from modern Internet group suicide because it occurred among lovers or family members rather than among strangers. Another difference is that mutual consent from those who die by historical shinj\u016b was not required. In other words, certain forms of shinj\u016b might be considered \"murder-suicide\" in Western cultures rather than suicide. An example of this type of shinj\u016b would be a mother killing her children and then killing herself.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva2\" />\n\nAn example of historical shinj\u016b in Japanese literature can be found in [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]]'s puppet play from 1703 entitled Sonezaki Shinjuu (\"The Love Suicides at Sonezaki\"), which was later re-engineered for the kabuki theater. The inspiration for the play was an actual [[Shinj\u016b|double suicide]] which had then recently occurred between two forbidden lovers.<ref name=Keene>{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110980/Chikamatsu-Monzaemon|title=Chikamatsu Monzaemon|last=Keene|first=Donald|date= 30 April 2013|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=2014-11-24}}</ref>\n\nThese modern shinj\u016b have not received the same level of tolerance or social acceptability as an honor suicide (seppuku or hara-kiri) from the Japanese media. Internet group suicide has generally been portrayed as a thoughtless and impulsive act by the media because it seems that there is no compelling reason for why individuals enter into such pacts. In contrast, seppuku serves a specific function; to preserve honor rather than die at the hand of an enemy.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" /> However, this perception has been challenged by research on Internet group suicide by Ozawa de-Silva, who argues that these deaths are \"characterized by severe existential suffering, a loss of the \"worth of living\" ([[ikigai]])...and a profound loneliness and lack of connection with others\".<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" />\n\nOverall, modern public concern about Japan's increasing suicide rate has tended to focus on suicide as a social issue rather than a public health concern. The distinction here is that Japanese culture emphasizes maladjustment into society and social factors as playing a larger role in an individual's decision to commit suicide than an individual psychopathology that is biological in nature.<ref name=\"ueno\"/> Furthermore, stigma surrounding mental health care still exists in Japan.<ref name=\"ozawa-desilva\" /> Thus, there has been more emphasis on reforming social programs that contribute to economic stability (i.e. welfare) rather than creating specific mental health services.\n\nAccording to The New Yorker, \"by tradition, a mother who killed herself but not her children was thought to be truly wicked.\"<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/last-call-3</ref>{{Better source|reason=The tertiary source does not provide other sources or data to support statement on Japanese traditions.|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Government response==\nIn 2007, the government released a nine-step plan, a \"counter-suicide [[White paper|White Paper]]\", which it hopes will curb suicide by 20% by 2017.<ref name=\"Times govt whitepaper\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2852762.ece|title=90 suicides a day spur Japan into action|last=Lewis|first=Leo|date=12 November 2007|newspaper= The Times|accessdate=2008-09-23}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The goal of the white paper is to encourage investigation of the root causes of suicide in order to prevent it, change cultural attitudes toward suicide, and improve treatment of unsuccessful suicides.<ref name=\"Times govt whitepaper\"/> In 2009, the Japanese government committed 15.8 billion yen towards suicide prevention strategies.\n\nJapan has allotted 12.4 billion yen ($133 million) in suicide prevention assets for the 2010 fiscal year ending March 2011, with plans to fund public counseling for those with overwhelming debts and those needing treatment for depression.<ref name=APW/>\n\nAmid the overall increase in self-inflicted death for 2009, the government claims there have been encouraging signs since September.

The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this [[video game genre|genre]] is the jump button, but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks, as in ''[[Ristar]]'' or ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'', or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in ''[[Alpha Waves]]''. These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called ''platforming'', a [[verbification]] of ''platform''. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, fall outside of the genre.\n\nPlatform games originated in the early 1980s, which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping, with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] successors popularized in the mid-1990s. The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the [[gameplay]] and came into use after the genre had been established, no later than 1983.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.specusphere.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=232&Itemid=32 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219082328/http://www.specusphere.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=232&Itemid=32 | archivedate=2007-02-19 | title=Gamespeak: A glossary of gaming terms| publisher=Specusphere | date=|accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref><ref name=\"Crash Software Review, Issue 1\">{{cite journal | url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/Crash/Catalogue-Issue02/04.jpg | title=Crash Software Review, Issue 1| publisher=Crash Micro Action Games |accessdate=2008-06-14}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres, such as the [[shooter game|shooter]] elements in ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'', [[Beat 'em up]] elements of ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', [[adventure game|adventure]] elements of ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]]'', or [[console RPG|role-playing game]] elements of ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''.\n\nWhile commonly associated with [[console gaming]], there have been many important platform games released to [[video arcade]]s, as well as for [[handheld game console]]s and [[Personal computer|home computers]]. North America, Europe and Japan have played major parts in the genre's evolution. Platform themes range from cartoon-like games to [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] epics.\n\nAt one point, platform games were the most popular genre of video game. At the peak of their popularity, it is estimated that between one-quarter and one-third of console games were platformers,<ref>This estimate is based on the number of platform games released on specific systems. For example, on the [[Master System]], 113 of the 347 games (32.5 percent) listed on vgmuseum.com are platform games, and 264 of the 1044 [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] games (25.2 percent) are platformers</ref> but these have since been supplanted by first-person shooters.<ref>https://www.statista.com/statistics/189592/breakdown-of-us-video-game-sales-2009-by-genre/</ref> As of 2006, the genre had become far less dominant, representing a two percentage market share as compared to fifteen percent in 1998,<ref name=\"detailed cross-examination\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | title=A Detailed Cross-Examination of Yesterday and Today's Best-Selling Platform Games | website=[[Gamasutra]] | date=2006-08-04 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027033801/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | archive-date=2007-10-27 | url-status=live }}</ref> but is still commercially viable, with a number of games selling in the millions of units.

Most, but not all, early examples of platform games were confined to a static playing field, generally viewed in profile.\n\n''[[Space Panic]]'', a 1980 arcade release by [[Aruze|Universal]], is sometimes credited as being the first platform game,<ref>{{cite book|title=Chris Crawford on Game Design|isbn=0-88134-117-7|last=Crawford|first=Chris|title-link=Chris Crawford on Game Design|authorlink=Chris Crawford (game designer)|year=2003|publisher=New Riders}}</ref> though the distinction is contentious. While the player has the ability to fall, there is no ability to jump, so the game does not satisfy most modern definitions of the genre. However, it clearly influenced the genre, with gameplay centered on climbing ladders between different floors, a common element in many early platform games. A difficult game to learn, ''Space Panic'' remained obscure as an arcade game, but the 1981 unauthorized clone ''[[Apple Panic]]'' was a hit for home computers.\n\nAnother precursor to the genre from 1980 was [[Nichibutsu]]'s ''[[Crazy Climber]]'', which has the player scaling vertically-scrolling skyscrapers.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7426|name=Crazy Climber}}</ref>\n\n''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', an [[arcade game]] created by [[Nintendo]] and released in July 1981, was the first game to allow players to jump over obstacles and across gaps, making it the first true platformer.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=donkey-kong&page=detail&id=666| title=Donkey Kong| publisher=Arcade History| date=2006-11-21| accessdate=2006-11-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020111301/http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=donkey-kong&page=detail&id=666| archive-date=2007-10-20| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GamesRadar-3\">{{cite web|title=Gaming's most important evolutions|page=3|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=Oct 8, 2010|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3|accessdate=2011-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153722/http://www.gamesradar.com/gamings-most-important-evolutions/?page=3|archive-date=March 19, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It introduced [[Mario]], a modern icon of the genre, under the name Jumpman.

This title laid the groundwork for other two-player cooperative platformers such as ''[[Fairyland Story]]'' and ''[[Bubble Bobble]]''.\n\nBeginning in 1982, transitional games emerged that did not feature [[scrolling]] graphics, but had levels that spanned [[Flip-screen|several connected screens]]. ''[[Pitfall!]]'', released for the [[Atari 2600]], featured broad, horizontally extended levels. It became one of the best-selling games on the system and was a breakthrough for the genre. ''[[Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle]]'' was released on the [[ColecoVision]] that same year, adding uneven terrain and [[Panning (camera)|scrolling pans]] between static screens. ''[[Manic Miner]]'' (1983) and its sequel ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'' (1984) continued this style of multi-screen levels on [[home computer]]s. ''[[Wanted: Monty Mole]]'' won the first ever award for Best Platform game in 1984 from ''Crash'' magazine.<ref>{{citation|title=Readers' Awards|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/12/awards.htm|publisher=Crash|issue=12|year=1984\u20131985|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418044804/http://www.crashonline.org.uk/12/awards.htm|archive-date=18 April 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Later that same year, [[Epyx]] released ''[[Impossible Mission]]'', and [[Parker Brothers]] released ''[[Montezuma's Revenge (video game)|Montezuma's Revenge]]'', which further expanded on the exploration aspect.\n\n{{see also|Wraparound (video games)|Flip-screen}}\n\n===Classification of early platformers===\nThe term ''platform game'' is somewhat ambiguous, particularly when referring to games that predate the widespread, international use of the term. The concept of a platform game as it was defined in its earliest days is somewhat different from how the term is commonly used today.\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', a genre of similarly-styled games emerged characterized by a profile view of tiers connected by ladders.  These included ''[[Kangaroo (video game)|Kangaroo]]'', ''[[Canyon Climber]]'', ''[[Ponpoko]]'', ''[[Miner 2049er]]'', ''[[Lode Runner]]'', and ''[[Jumpman (video game)|Jumpman]]''. The two most common gameplay goals were to get to the top of the screen or to collect all of a particular item, both of which are found in ''Donkey Kong''.  The North American press, including leading magazine ''[[Electronic Games]]'', labeled the genre \"climbing games.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games|journal=Electronic Games|date=January 1983|volume=1|issue=11|page=49|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|access-date=2015-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|archive-date=2016-03-19|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=Steve |title=Video Invaders |date=1982 |publisher=Arco Publishing |isbn=978-0668055208 |page=[https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders/page/n49 29] |url=https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders}}</ref> London-based ''TV Gamer'' magazine listed \"Climbing\" as a game category in the March 1983 issue, calling ''Donkey Kong'' \"the most famous of all climbing games.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reviews Explained: The Game Categories |journal=TV Gamer |date=March 1983 |page=76 |url=https://archive.org/details/tv-gamer-magazine-1983-03/page/n75?q=climbing+games  |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe terms ''platform game'' and ''platformer'' have since gained wide use in the UK, North America, and across Europe. Since the earliest uses the concept has evolved, particularly as the genre peaked in popularity during the early 1990s. Many of the games that were part of the early platform genre, such as ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Miner 2049er'', are still regarded as platform games in the modern sense.\n\n===Scrolling movement===\n{{see also|Side-scrolling video game}}\n[[File:Jump Bug.png|thumb|''[[Jump Bug]]'' (1981) introduced scrolling to the genre.]]\n\nThe first platform game to use scrolling graphics came years before the genre became a trend.<ref name=\"retro.ign.com\">{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/861/861550p2.html |title=IGN: The Leif Ericson Awards |publisher=Retro.ign.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2013-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041726/http://retro.ign.com/articles/861/861550p2.html |archive-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Jump Bug]]'' is a platform-shooter developed by [[Alpha Denshi]] under contract for [[Banpresto|Hoei/Coreland]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/retro/retro/review/sa/jumpbug.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412184957/http://www.ne.jp/asahi/retro/retro/review/sa/jumpbug.html | archivedate=2008-04-12 | title=\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30d0\u30b0 \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3057\u307e\u5c02\u79d1 | publisher= |accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> and released to arcades in 1981, only five months after ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=jump-bug&page=detail&id=1236 | title=Jump Bug | publisher=Arcade History | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007225104/http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=jump-bug&page=detail&id=1236 | archive-date=2012-10-07 | url-status=live }}</ref> Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings, clouds, and hills. As part of a nascent genre, its development was not strongly influenced by existing conventions, nor was it said to be a major influence on games immediately after it. ''Jump Bug'' offered a glimpse of what was to come, with uneven, independently suspended platforms and levels that scroll both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=\"retro.ign.com\"/>\n\nOnly a few home systems of the early 1980s had hardware support for smooth background scrolling&mdash;most notably the [[Atari 8-bit family]]. Nevertheless,  ''[[B.C.'s Quest For Tires]]'' was released by Sierra On-Line  in 1983 on the [[ColecoVision]] and several home computer platforms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/colecovision/bcs-quest-for-tires | title=BC's Quest for Tires | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=2007-02-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015142407/http://www.mobygames.com/game/colecovision/bcs-quest-for-tires | archive-date=2007-10-15 | url-status=live }}</ref> The game features large, smooth-scrolling levels and simple platform gameplay in which players jump over oncoming pitfalls and obstacles, much like ''[[Moon Patrol]]''.

The title was bundled with Nintendo systems in North America, Japan, and Europe, and went on to sell over 40 million copies, according to the 1999 [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. Its success as a pack-in led many companies to see platform games as vital to their success, and contributed greatly to popularizing the genre during the [[8-bit era|8-bit console generation]].\n\n[[Sega]] attempted to emulate this success with their ''[[Alex Kidd]]'' series, which began in 1986 on the [[Master System]] with ''[[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]'', a platformer that features horizontal and vertical scrolling levels, the ability to punch enemies and obstacles, and shops where the player can buy [[power-up]]s and vehicles.

Because of their small size, technical constraints, and blurring associated with the [[LCD]] technology, fast-paced action-based platformers were more difficult to develop for these handheld systems. Because of this, many early handheld platformers leaned towards slower-paced play styles and a greater emphasis on puzzles.\n\nDuring [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|Sixth Generation]] and early [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|Seventh]] generations, home consoles largely transitioned to 3D games and handhelds became a bastion for traditional side-scrolling platform games, until the release of ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

By the time the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] launched, platform games were the most popular genre in home console gaming and were seen as vital for winning the [[console war]]. There was a particular emphasis on having a flagship platform title exclusive to a format, featuring a mascot character. In 1989, Sega released ''[[Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle]]''. The title was only modestly successful, and Sega realized it needed a stronger mascot to move Genesis units. That same year, Capcom released the platformer ''[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]'', which scrolled in multiple directions and allowed the player to summon [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) partners, such as a droid, tiger, and hawk, to help fight enemies.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref> Another Sega release in 1989 was ''[[Shadow Dancer]]'', which also featured an AI partner: a dog who followed the player around and aid in battle.<ref>{{KLOV game|9499|Shadow Dancer}}</ref> In 1990, [[Hudson Soft]] released ''[[Bonk's Adventure]]'', featuring a character that was positioned as [[NEC]]'s mascot.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bonkzonk.com/series.shtml | title=Series Guide | publisher=Bonk Compendium | accessdate=2007-01-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125052034/http://bonkzonk.com/series.shtml | archive-date=2007-01-25 | url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, Takeru's ''[[Cocoron]]'', a late platformer for the Famicom, introduced true character customization, allowing players to build a character from a toy box filled with spare parts.<ref name=\"Playing With Power\"/>\n\n1991 marked the release of the [[Super NES]], along with the eagerly anticipated ''[[Super Mario World]]''.

''Sonic'' featured large stages that scrolled effortlessly in all directions, as well as all manner of uneven terrain, curved hills, and a complex [[game physics|physics system]] that allowed players to rush through its levels with well-placed jumps and rolls. Lastly, there was the game's eponymous main character.

These mascots, which included ''[[Gex (character)|Gex]]'', ''[[Mr. Nutz]]'', ''[[Aero the Acro-Bat]]'', ''[[Awesome Possum... Kicks Dr. Machino's Butt|Awesome Possum]]'', and ''[[Bubsy]]'', have mostly faded from relevance.\n\nAlthough there had long been important platform games on home computers, a second generation of platform games for computers appeared alongside the new wave of consoles. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the [[Amiga]] was known as a stronger gaming platform than [[IBM PC compatibles]], thanks to its more powerful stock [[Original Amiga chipset|video hardware and sound hardware]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a600tech.html | title=Amiga 600 Technical Specifications | publisher=Amiga History|date=December 15, 2002 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> The [[Atari ST]] was solidly supported as well. Games like ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'' and ''[[Turrican]]'' showed that computer platform games could rival the graphics and sound of their console contemporaries. ''[[Prince of Persia]]'', originally released for the Apple II in 1989, long after that system's heyday, featured an unprecedented level of animation.\n\nThe 1988 shareware game ''[[The Adventures of Captain Comic]]'' was one of the first attempts at a Nintendo-style platformer for IBM PC compatibles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edwards |first1=Benj |title=The 12 Greatest PC Shareware Games of All-Time |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/248494/the_12_greatest_pc_shareware_games_of_all_time.html#slide2 |website=PC World |date=January 22, 2012 |access-date=September 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004212458/https://www.pcworld.com/article/248494/the_12_greatest_pc_shareware_games_of_all_time.html#slide2 |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\nIt inspired ''[[Commander Keen]]'', released by [[id Software]] in 1990, which became the first PC platformer with smooth scrolling graphics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/keenhistory/|title=A Look Back at Commander Keen|publisher=3DRealms.com|accessdate=2006-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402151326/http://legacy.3drealms.com/keenhistory/|archive-date=2016-04-02|url-status=live}}</ref> Keen's success resulted in numerous console-styled platformers on the PC, including ''[[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]]'', ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', ''[[Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure]]'', and ''[[Dark Ages (1991 video game)|Dark Ages]]'' by [[Apogee Software]], all of which helped fuel the [[shareware]] model of game distribution.\n\n====Decline of 2D====\nThe abundance of platformers for 16-bit consoles continued late into the generation, with successful games such as ''[[Vectorman]]'' (1995), ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' (1995), and ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' (1995), but the release of new hardware caused players' attention to shift away from traditional 2D genres.<ref name=\"detailed cross-examination\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo 64]] nevertheless featured a number of successful 2D platform games. The 2D ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman]]'' was a big success on 32-bit consoles. ''[[Mega Man 8]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X4]]'' helped revitalize interest in [[Capcom]]'s [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man character]]. ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' revitalized its series and established a new foundation for later ''Castlevania'' games. ''[[Oddworld]]'' and ''[[Heart of Darkness (game)|Heart of Darkness]]'' kept the subgenre born from ''Prince of Persia'' alive.\n\nThe difficulties of adapting platform gameplay to three dimensions led some developers to compromise by pairing the visual flash of 3D with traditional 2D side scrolling gameplay. These games are often referred to as 2.5D.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | title=It's a Viewtiful Day | website=[[Gamasutra]] | date=2004-08-24 | accessdate=2007-01-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027033801/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | archive-date=2007-10-27 | url-status=live }}</ref> The first such game was the [[Sega Saturn]] [[launch title]], ''[[Clockwork Knight]]'' (1994). The game featured levels and [[boss (video games)|boss]] characters rendered in 3D, but retained 2D gameplay and used pre-rendered 2D sprites for regular characters, similar to ''Donkey Kong Country''. Its [[Clockwork Knight 2|sequel]] improved upon its design, featuring some 3D effects such as hopping between the foreground and background, and the camera panning and curving around corners. Meanwhile, ''[[Pandemonium (video game)|Pandemonium]]'' and ''[[Klonoa]]'' brought the 2.5D style to the [[PlayStation]]. In a break from the past, the Nintendo 64 had the fewest side scrolling platformers with only four; ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''[[Goemon's Great Adventure]]'', and ''[[Mischief Makers]]''\u2014and most met with a tepid response from critics at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/199386-yoshis-story/index.html | title=Yoshi's Story Reviews | publisher=[[GameRankings]] | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402074207/http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/199386-yoshis-story/index.html | archive-date=2009-04-02 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197950-mischief-makers/index.html | title=Mischief Makers Reviews | publisher=[[GameRankings]] | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319075644/http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197950-mischief-makers/index.html | archive-date=2009-03-19 | url-status=live }}</ref> Despite this, ''Yoshi's Story'' sold over a million copies in the US,<ref name=\"US Platinum Game Chart\"/> and ''Mischief Makers'' rode high on the charts in the months following its release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/backontop.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101112407/http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/backontop.html | archivedate=2009-01-01 | title=N64 Back on Top | last=Johnston | first=Chris | publisher=SF Kosmo (archived from GameSpot) | date=1997-11-06 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/closegap.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175337/http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/closegap.html | archivedate=2011-05-25 | title=Sony Closes the Gap | last=Johnston | first=Chris | publisher=SF Kosmo (archived from GameSpot) | date=1997-10-02 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===The third dimension===\nThe term ''3D platformer'' usually refers to games that feature gameplay in three dimensions and polygonal 3D graphics. Games that have 3D gameplay but 2D graphics are usually included under the umbrella of ''[[#Isometric platform game|isometric platformers]]'', while those that have 3D graphics but gameplay on a 2D plane are called ''[[2.5D]]'', as they are a blend of 2D and 3D.\n\nThe first attempts to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and had an [[isometric perspective]]. These games are nearly as old as the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's ''[[Congo Bongo]]'' in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was [[Konami]]'s platform game ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]'',<ref name=KLOV-Antarctic>{{KLOV game|6890|Antarctic Adventure}}</ref> where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles.<ref name=KLOV-Antarctic/><ref name=allgame-Antarctic/><ref name=Moby-Antarctic/> Originally released in 1983 for the [[MSX]] computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year,<ref name=Moby-Antarctic>{{MobyGames|id=/msx/antarctic-adventure|name=Antarctic Adventure}}</ref> including an [[Arcade game|arcade]] version,<ref name=KLOV-Antarctic/> [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]],<ref name=Moby-Antarctic/> and [[ColecoVision]].<ref name=allgame-Antarctic>{{allgame|19267|Antarctic Adventure}}</ref>\n\n1986 saw the release of the sequel to forward-scrolling platformer ''Antarctic Adventure'' called ''[[Penguin Adventure]]'', which was designed by [[Hideo Kojima]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1229899_1124.html|title=KONAMI\u306eMSX\u5f80\u5e74\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u304cWii\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3001\u7b2c2\u5f3e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u300e\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30ae\u30a2\u300f\u306e\u914d\u4fe1\u3082\u6c7a\u5b9a - \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com|website=www.famitsu.com|accessdate=16 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030003205/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1229899_1124.html|archive-date=30 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It included more [[action game]] elements, a greater variety of levels, [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] elements such as upgrading equipment,<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/penguin-adventure|name=Penguin Adventure}}</ref> and [[multiple endings]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130127035955/http://gamespot.com/msx/action/penguinadventure/cheats.html Penguin Adventure], [[GameSpot]]</ref>\n\nIn early 1987, [[Square (video game company)|Square]] released ''[[3-D WorldRunner]]'', designed by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Nasir Gebelli]].<ref name=\"nextgen\"/><ref name=WorldRunner/> Using a forward-scrolling effect similar to Sega's 1985 [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[rail shooter]] ''[[Space Harrier]]''.<ref name=\"nextgen\">\"Hironobu Sakaguchi: The Man Behind the Fantasies\".

It allowed players to move in all directions, but it did not allow movement along more than one axis at once; the player could move orthogonally but not diagonally. Its characters were [[pre-rendered]] sprites, much like the earlier ''[[Clockwork Knight]]''. The game played very similarly to 2D platformers, but it was considered a true 3D title, and let players walk up walls and on ceilings. It was a moderate success, and spawned a sequel called ''Bug Too!''.\n\nIn 1995, [[Delphine Software]] released a 3D sequel to their popular 2D platformer ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]]''. Entitled ''[[Fade to Black (video game)|Fade to Black]]'', it was the first attempt to bring a popular 2D platform game series into 3D. While it retained the puzzle-oriented level design style and step-based control, and bore a strong resemblance to its predecessor, it did not meet the criteria of a platform game, and was billed as an [[action-adventure game|action adventure]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/fade-to-black/cover-art/gameCoverId,52838/ | title=Fade to Black - DOS Cover Art | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=2007-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015142418/http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/fade-to-black/cover-art/gameCoverId,52838/ | archive-date=2007-10-15 | url-status=live }}</ref> It used true 3D characters and set pieces, but its environments were rendered using a rigid engine similar to the one used by ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', in that it could only render square, flat corridors, rather than suspended platforms that could be jumped between. ''Fade to Black'' set the stage for other series, such as ''[[Metroid Prime|Metroid]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'', that gradually shifted away from the traditional platform formula while retaining many of its gameplay conventions.\n\nThere was a great deal of pressure on Sony, Sega, and Nintendo to release mascot platformers before the 1996 holiday season. Sony chose to adopt an existing project by developers [[Naughty Dog]], a small developer at the time, who had recently released the questionable ''[[Way of the Warrior (video game)|Way of the Warrior]]''. The move paid off; their game, ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'', beat Nintendo's new console to market in North America and was released in time for the holiday in Japan. Crash remained Sony's unofficial mascot for the next several years before switching to multi-platform releases in the following console generation.\n\nSega did not fare as well. They had tasked their American studio, [[Sega Technical Institute]], with bringing Sonic the Hedgehog into 3D. Their project, titled ''[[Sonic Xtreme]]'', was to have featured a radically different approach for the series, with an exaggerated [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] camera and multidirectional gameplay reminiscent of ''Bug!''. Its development was rocky, due in part to conflicts with Sega Enterprises in Japan and a rushed schedule, and the game never made it to market.\n\n====True 3D====\n<!--- Do not add false rumors about ''Super Mario 64'' originally being developed on the SNES as ''Super Mario FX'' on this article--->\nBeginning in the 1990s platforming games began to transform from pseudo-3D to \"true 3D\" experiences, the distinction being constraints on the degree of control the player over the character and camera.  Rendering of 3D environment from angles controlled by the user necessitates that the graphics hardware be sufficiently powerful, and that the art and rendering model of the game can be viewed from an arbitrary angle.  The improvement in graphics technology allowed publishers to produce such games, but introduced several new issues; for example, if the [[virtual camera]] can be positioned arbitrarily, it must be constrained to prevent it from [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]] through the environment.\n\nIn 1994, a small developer called Exact released a game for the [[X68000]] computer called ''Geograph Seal''. The game was a fully 3D polygonal first-person shooter hybrid with a pronounced platform jumping component. Players piloted a frog-like [[mech]] that could jump and then [[double jump (video gaming)|double-jump]] or triple-jump high into the air, as the camera panned down to help players line up their landings. In addition to shooting, jumping on enemies was a primary means of attack.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.plala.or.jp/yasinoue/oldgame/geog1.html | title=Geograph Seal | accessdate=2006-12-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210142618/http://www2.plala.or.jp/yasinoue/oldgame/geog1.html | archive-date=2006-12-10 | url-status=live }}</ref> This was the first true 3D platform-action game with free-roaming environments, but it was never ported to another platform nor released outside Japan, so it remains relatively unknown in the West.<ref name=nextlevel>Travis Fahs, [http://www.the-nextlevel.com/review/retro/geograph-seal-x68000/ Geograph Seal (X68000)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129224512/http://www.the-nextlevel.com/review/retro/geograph-seal-x68000/ |date=2016-01-29 }}, ''The Next Level'', November 25, 2006</ref>\n\nThe following year, Exact released their follow-up to ''Geograph Seal'' as an early title for Sony's new [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console.

The frog-like mech was traded in for a more cartoony rabbit mech, called Robbit. Beyond this, the level design had an even greater focus on platform hopping, and it was released in Europe and North America as a [[launch title]], helping it gain a much higher profile.

Before then, there was no established paradigm for bringing platform games into 3D. ''Mario 64'' set a new standard, and it was imitated by many subsequent 3D platformers. Its gameplay allowed players to explore open 3D environments with greater freedom than any previous attempt at a 3D platform game. To aid this, Nintendo added an [[analog sticks|analog control stick]] to its Nintendo 64 controller, something which had not been included in a standard console controller since the [[Vectrex]], and which has since become standard on other controllers. This allowed for the finer precision needed for a free perspective. Players no longer followed a linear path to the ends of levels, either, with most levels providing objective-based goals. There were a handful of [[boss fight|boss levels]] that offered more traditional platforming. It was rumored that ''Super Mario 64'' was originally going to be developed for the SNES using the [[Super FX]] chip entitled ''Super Mario FX'', however this was proven false by [[Dylan Cuthbert]], one of the programmers at [[Argonaut Software]] who worked on ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]'', as \"Super Mario FX\" was just the codename for the Super FX chip.<ref name=\"Dylan Cuthbert Super Mario FX\">{{cite web | title=Dylan Cuthbert | url=https://twitter.com/dylancuthbert/statuses/165596909413728256 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525211908/https://twitter.com/dylancuthbert/statuses/165596909413728256 | archive-date=May 25, 2014 | publisher=Twitter | access-date=May 25, 2014 | quote=SNES Central: @dylancuthbert I'm researching unreleased SNES games, was a game called \"Super Mario FX\" ever in development?<br />Dylan Cuthbert: @snescentral no, that was the internal code name for the FX chip\" }}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario 64'' brought a change in the goals of some platformers. In most 2D platformers, the player only had to reach a single goal to complete a level, but in ''Mario 64'' each level contained a mission based structure that rewarded items needed to unlock new areas. Many 3D platformers followed this trend such as ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Spyro the Dragon (video game)|Spyro the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'' creating the \"collect-a-thon\" genre. This allowed for more efficient use of large 3D areas and rewarded the player for thorough exploration of their environment, but also contained less jumping and involved more elements of [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] games.\n\nAs platform games settled into this new free-roaming model, it became necessary for developers to program a dynamic, intelligent camera. This was a non-issue with 2D platformers, which were able to maintain a fixed viewpoint. The addition of a free camera also made it more difficult for players to judge the exact height and distance of platforms, making [[jumping puzzle]]s more difficult. Some of the more linear 3D platformers, like ''[[Tork: Prehistoric Punk]]'' and ''[[Wario World]]'' used scripted cameras that allowed for minimal player control. Others with more open environments, such as ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Banjo Kazooie'', needed intelligent cameras that follow the players movements.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cea.mdx.ac.uk/?location_id=61&item=7 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420214513/http://www.cea.mdx.ac.uk/?location_id=61&item=7 | archivedate=2012-04-20| title=Intuitive Interaction and Expressive Cinematography in Video Games | last=Cozic| first=Laurent| publisher= |accessdate=2006-01-27|format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}</ref> These intelligent cameras were not perfect, and required the player to adjust the view at times when the view was obstructed, or simply not facing what the player needed to see.\n\n[[console RPG|RPG]]s, [[first person shooter]]s, and more complex [[action-adventure game]]s were all capturing more market share. Even so, ''[[Tomb Raider (series)|Tomb Raider]]'' became one of the best selling series on the [[PlayStation]], along with [[Insomniac Games]]' ''[[Spyro (series)|Spyro]]'' and [[Naughty Dog]]'s ''[[Crash Bandicoot (series)|Crash Bandicoot]]'', one of the few 3D titles to retain the linear level design of 2D games. Also, many of the [[Nintendo 64]]'s best sellers were first and second-party platformers like ''Super Mario 64'', ''Banjo-Kazooie'', and ''Donkey Kong 64''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|title=US Platinum Game Chart|publisher=Magic Box|accessdate=2006-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421003854/http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|archive-date=2007-04-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Into the 21st century====\nBy the [[History of video games (Sixth generation era)|sixth generation era]], platformers were no longer seen as hot system sellers. Sega finally produced a 3D Sonic game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', on its new [[Dreamcast]] console. It used a hub structure like ''Mario 64'' but featured more linear, action-oriented levels with an emphasis on speed. Although the game was a hit, it was not enough to save the Dreamcast from an early discontinuation in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/090/090862p1.html | title=Sega of Japans Comments on Dreamcast Discontinuance | website=IGN | date=2001-01-31 | accessdate=2007-02-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019010356/http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/090/090862p1.html | archive-date=2007-10-19 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nNintendo launched its [[GameCube]] console without a platform game. However, it released ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' in 2002, the second 3D ''Mario'' game. While the title was well received at the time of its release, it has since received criticism regarding such factors as its short length, lack of location variety, and level design, which featured an abundance of open space, making for a much slower-paced game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejadedgamer.net/review_gcn_supermariosunshine.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125062547/http://www.thejadedgamer.net/review_gcn_supermariosunshine.shtml |archivedate=November 25, 2005 |title=Super Mario Sunshine|last=Maiorana|first=Stephen|publisher=The Jaded Gamer|date=2003-04-25|accessdate=2006-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameshark.com/?s=34ff38a9-a7eb-4d77-a69c-b7bddbfa9fbd&c=gamecube&a=reviews&id=150|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026130719/http://www.gameshark.com/?s=34ff38a9-a7eb-4d77-a69c-b7bddbfa9fbd&c=gamecube&a=reviews&id=150|archivedate=2005-10-26|title=Super Mario Sunshine|last=Larkin|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[GameShark]]|date=2003-04-28|accessdate=2006-11-22}}</ref>\n\nOther notable 3D platformers trickled out during this generation. ''[[Maximo: Ghosts to Glory|Maximo]]'' was a spiritual heir to the ''[[Ghosts'n Goblins]]'' series. ''[[Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg]]'' offered [[Yuji Naka]]'s take on a ''Mario 64''-influenced platformer, and ''[[Psychonauts]]'' became a critical darling based on its imaginative levels and colorful characters.

Other forms of third-person action games have cut into the sales of platformers, while genres such as RPGs and first-person shooters have continued to grow in popularity.

In 2008, ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' paired traditional 2D platform game mechanics with physics simulation and [[user created content]], earning strong sales and critical reaction. [[Electronic Arts]] released ''[[Mirror's Edge]]'', which coupled platform gameplay with a first-person camera, but avoided marketing the game as a [[platformer]] because of the association the label had developed with games geared toward younger audiences.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'' featured stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of platform gameplay; this formula was also used in ''[[Sonic Colors]]'' and ''[[Sonic Generations]]''.

These range from classic revivals such as ''[[Bionic Commando: Rearmed]]'', ''[[Contra ReBirth]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'', to original titles like ''[[Splosion Man]]'' and ''[[Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure]]''. ''[[Wario Land: The Shake Dimension]]'', released in 2008, was a platformer that featured completely two-dimensional graphics and a rich visual style. Subsequent games such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'', ''[[A Boy and His Blob (2009 video game)|A Boy and His Blob]]'', and [[The Behemoth]]'s ''[[BattleBlock Theater]]'' also use completely 2D graphics. ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' is particularly notable, as unlike the majority of 2D platformers in the 21st century, it was a direct release for a non-portable console, and not restricted on a [[content delivery network]]. The success of ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' led to Nintendo releasing similar 2D platformer games for their classic franchises the following year: ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]''.\n\nIn 2009, independent developer [[Frozenbyte]] released ''[[Trine (video game)|Trine]]'', a [[2.5D]] platform game that mixed traditional elements with more modern physics puzzles. The game proved to be a commercial success, eventually selling more than 1.1 million copies.

In 2012, Nintendo released two more 2D platform games: ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for the 3DS and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' for the [[Wii U]]. Nintendo has also released 3D platform games with gameplay elements of 2D platform games, namely ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' for the 3DS in 2011 and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' for the Wii U in 2013, the latter of which also included [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] gameplay. Each has achieved critical and commercial success.\n\n2017 saw the release of a number of 3D platformers which caused media speculation of a renewal of the genre.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These games included ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]'' and ''[[A Hat in Time]]'', both of which were [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] on the website [[Kickstarter]]. The release of ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' on the [[Nintendo Switch]], which was an updated return to the open ended gameplay style popularized by ''Super Mario 64'', saw some of the most critical acclaim in the franchise's history. The ''[[Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy]]'' compilation on the [[PlayStation 4]] sold over two million copies worldwide, and some critics noted the increased difficulty from the original PlayStation games.\n\n==Subgenres==\n{{original research|section|date=February 2011}}\nThere are many games that are platformers that do not adhere to any of the subgenres below, but the following are some of the more recognizable archetypes for different platform styles. There are many more vaguely defined subgenres that are not mentioned here because they are not as easily defined.\n\n===Puzzle-platform game===\n{{see also|Puzzle video game}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'' is a 2012 Puzzle-platformer with puzzles based around a screen rotation mechanic.]]\nPuzzle platformers are characterized by their use of a platform game structure to drive a game whose challenge is derived primarily from [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]]. They normally feature a gimmick which is used throughout the entire game and as the level design becomes more complicated players are tasked with using that gimmick in different ways.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://robsretroreviews.blogspot.com/2016/07/17-sub-genres-of-platformer-games-list.html| title=Archived copy| access-date=2019-01-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109062923/http://robsretroreviews.blogspot.com/2016/07/17-sub-genres-of-platformer-games-list.html| archive-date=2019-01-09| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Enix]]'s 1983 release ''[[Door Door]]'' and Sega's 1985 release ''[[Doki Doki Penguin Land]]'' (for the [[SG-1000]]) are perhaps the first examples, though the genre is diverse, and classifications can vary. ''[[Doki Doki Penguin Land]]'' allowed players to run and jump in typical platform fashion, but they could also destroy blocks, and were tasked with guiding an egg to the bottom of the level without letting it break.\n\n''[[The Lost Vikings]]'' (1992) was one of the more popular titles in this genre, as well. It featured three characters players could switch between, each with different abilities. Players had to use all three characters to reach the level goals.\n\nThis subgenre has a strong presence on handheld platforms. ''[[Wario Land 2]]'' moved the Wario series into the puzzle-platformer genre by eliminating the element of death and adding temporary injuries, such as being squashed or lit on fire, and specialized powers. ''[[Wario Land 3]]'' continued this tradition, while ''[[Wario Land 4]]'' was more of a mix of puzzle and traditional platform elements. The [[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Game Boy update of ''Donkey Kong'']] was also a successful portable puzzle-platformer, and saw a sequel on Game Boy Advance called ''[[Mario vs Donkey Kong]]''. ''[[Klonoa: Empire of Dreams]]'', the first handheld title in its series, was also a puzzle-platformer.\n\nIn more recent years, the genre has experienced some revival, especially in independent game development. ''Braid'' uses time manipulation for its puzzles, and ''[[And Yet It Moves]]'' uses [[frame of reference]] rotation.  In contrast to these [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrollers]], ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' and its successor, ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' are first-person camera games that use portals to solve puzzles in 3D. Since the release of ''Portal'', there have been more puzzle platformers that use a first-person camera, including ''Purity'' and ''[[Tag: The Power of Paint]]''.\n\n===Run-and-gun platform game===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Broforce four players.png|thumb|right|''[[Broforce]]'' is a run-and-gun platform game that spoofs on several [[action film]] heroes]]\nThe [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] platformer genre was popularized by [[Konami]]'s classic ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''. ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'' and ''[[Metal Slug]]'' are also among the most popular examples of this style. Side-scrolling run and gun games are an attempt to marry platform games with [[shoot 'em up]]s, characterized by a minimal focus on precise platform jumping and a major emphasis on multi-directional shooting. These games are sometimes called platform shooters. This genre has strong arcade roots, and as such, these games are generally known for being very difficult, and having very linear, one-way game progression.\n\nThere are games which feature a heavy degree of shooting but do not fall into this subgenre. ''[[Mega Man (video game)|Mega Man]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'', ''[[Vectorman]]'', ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit]]'', ''[[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]]'', ''[[Cuphead]]'' and ''[[Turrican]]'' are all platformers with a heavy focus on action and shooting, but unlike ''Contra'' or ''Metal Slug'', platform jumping elements, as well as exploration and back-tracking, still figure prominently. Run and guns are generally very pure, and while they may have vehicular sequences or other changes in style, they stay focused on shooting throughout.\n\n===Cinematic platform game===\n[[File:Another World platform game.gif|thumb|''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'', like other cinematic platformers, features a realistically proportioned character and rotoscoped animation.]]\nCinematic platformers are a small but distinct subgenre of platform games, usually distinguished by their relative realism compared to traditional platformers.  These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platform games.<ref name=\"Bexander2014\" /> To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'', have employed [[rotoscoping]] techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts.<ref name=Therrien /> Jumping abilities are typically roughly within the confines of an athletic human's capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of elevator platforms.<ref name=\"Bexander2014\" /> Other distinguishing characteristics include step-based control, in which an action is performed after the character completes his current animation, rather than the instant the button is pressed, and multi-screen stages that do not scroll.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAs these games tend to feature vulnerable characters who may die as the result of a single enemy attack or by falling a relatively short distance, they almost never have limited lives or continues. Challenge is derived from [[trial and error]] problem solving, forcing the player to find the right way to overcome a particular obstacle.<ref name=\"LaLone12\" />\n\n''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' was the first cinematic platformer and perhaps the most influential.<ref name=Rybicki08 /> ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' pioneered many of the defining elements of cinematic platformers and is an important precursor to this genre.<ref name=\"Retro122\" /> Other games in the genre include ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]]'' (and its 2013  [[Flashback (2013 video game)|remake]]), ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'', ''[[Heart of Darkness (video game)|Heart of Darkness]]'', the first two ''[[Oddworld]]'' games, ''[[Blackthorne]]'', ''[[Bermuda Syndrome]]'', ''[[Generations Lost]]'', ''[[Heart of the Alien]]'', ''[[Weird Dreams]]'', ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]'', ''[[Inside (video game)|Inside]]'', ''[[onEscapee]]'', ''[[Deadlight]]'', ''[[Rain World]]'' and [[The Way (video game)|The Way]].\n\n===Comical action game/Single Screen Platformer===\nThis genre lacks a commonly agreed upon name in the West, but games in the genre are most commonly called \"comical action games\" (CAGs) in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=2216&image=2 | title=Arcade Flyers: Cover Art | publisher=arcadeflyers.com | accessdate=2007-01-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904030844/http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=2216&image=2 | archive-date=2015-09-04 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=3390&image=2 | title=Arcade Flyers Cover Art | publisher=arcadeflyers.com | accessdate=2007-01-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904030844/http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=3390&image=2 | archive-date=2015-09-04 | url-status=live }}</ref> The original arcade ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' is generally recognized as the originator of this genre, though ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' is also highly influential. These games are characterized by single screen, non-scrolling levels and often contain cooperative two-player action. A level is cleared when all enemies on the screen have been defeated, and vanquished foes usually drop score bonuses in the form of fruit or other items. CAGs are almost exclusively developed in Japan and are either arcade games, or sequels to arcade games, though they are also a common genre among amateur [[dojin soft|''doujinshi'']] games. Other examples include ''[[Don Doko Don]]'', ''[[Snow Bros]]'' and ''[[Nightmare in the Dark]]''.\n\n===Isometric platform game===\n{{anchor|Isometric platformers|reason=Old section name; things linked to it.}}\n{{see also|Isometric graphics in video games}}{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}[[File:Knight Lore for MSX.gif|thumb|''[[Knight Lore]]'', an example of three-dimensional space represented on low-end hardware]]\n\nArguably a subgenre of both 3D and 2D platformers, isometric platformers present a three-dimensional environment using two-dimensional graphics in [[isometric projection]]. Although not the first [[Isometric graphics in video games|isometric games]], the earliest examples of isometric platform games are the arcade game ''[[Congo Bongo]]'' and ''[[Ant Attack]]'' for the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], both released in 1983.\n\n''[[Knight Lore]]'', an isometric sequel to ''[[Sabre Wulf]]'', helped to establish the conventions of early isometric platformers. This formula was repeated in later games like ''[[Head Over Heels (game)|Head Over Heels]]'' and ''[[Monster Max]]''. These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments, usually a series of small rooms connected by doors, and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements. Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese [[action-adventure game]]s like ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' to create games like ''[[Land Stalker]]'' and ''[[Light Crusader]]''. While these games are more generally classified as action adventures, they are also isometric platformers and an evolution of earlier conventions in the genre. This influence later traveled to Europe with Adeline Software's sprawling epic ''[[Little Big Adventure]]'', which blended RPG, [[adventure game|adventure]], and isometric platforming elements.\n\nBefore consoles were able to display true polygonal 3D graphics, the \u00be isometric perspective was used to move some popular 2D platformers into three-dimensional gameplay. ''[[Spot Goes To Hollywood]]'' was a sequel to the popular ''[[Cool Spot]]'', and ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' was Sonic's outing into the isometric subgenre.\n\n===Platform-adventure game===\n{{see also|Metroidvania}}\nMany games fuse platform game fundamentals with elements of [[action-adventure game]]s, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', or with elements of [[Role-playing video games|RPGs]]. Typically these elements include the ability to explore an area freely, with access to new areas granted by either gaining new abilities or using inventory items. Many 2D games in the ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' franchises are among the most popular games of this sort, and so games that take this type of approach are often labeled as \"[[Metroidvania]]\" games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/20/these-metroidvania-games-are-neither-metroid-nor-vania/ | author=Fletcher, JC | title=These Metroidvania games are

Game controls are limited to making the character jump, attack, or perform special actions. The object of these games is to get as far as possible before the character dies. Endless running games have found particular success on mobile platforms. They are well-suited to the small set of controls these games require, often limited to a single screen tap for jumping. Games with similar mechanics with automatic forward movement, but where levels have been pre-designed, or procedurally generated to have a set finish line, are often called \"auto-runners\" to distinguish them from endless runners.\n\nGame designer Scott Rogers named [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling shooter]]s like ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981) and ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' (1982) and chase-style gameplay in platform games like ''[[Disney's Aladdin (1994 video game)|Disney's Aladdin]]'' (1994 8-bit version) and ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' (1996) as forerunners of the genre.<ref name=Swipe>''Swipe This!: The Guide to Great Touchscreen Game Design'' by Scott Rogers, Wiley and Sons, 2012</ref> ''[[B.C.'s Quest for Tires]]'' (1983) is considered to be the first game with elements of the endless runner, but at the time, the format never took off.<ref name=\"newyorker canabalt\"/>\n\nIn February 2003, Gamevil published ''Nom'' for mobile phones in Korea. The game's designer Sin Bong-gu, stated that he wanted to create a game that was only possible on mobile phones, therefore he made the player character walk up walls and ceilings, requiring players to turn around their mobile phones while playing. To compensate for this complication, he limited the game's controls to a single button and let the character run automatically and indefinitely, \"like the people in modern society, who must always look forward and keep running\".<ref>{{cite web |date=May 28, 2004 |url=http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2004052802011468700002 |first=Ji-suk |last=Han |title=[Geim Keurieiteo] Geimbil 'Nom' gihoek Sin Bong-gu siljang |script-title=ko:[\uac8c\uc784 \ud06c\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc774\ud130] \uac8c\uc784\ube4c `\ub188` \uae30\ud68d \uc2e0\ubd09\uad6c \uc2e4\uc7a5 |trans-title=[Game Creator] Director Sin Bong-Gu, planner of Gamevil's `Nom` |language=ko |publisher=DigitalTimes |website=DigitalTimes |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709103137/http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2004052802011468700002 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhile the concept thus was long known in Korea, journalists credit ''[[Canabalt]]'' (2009) as \"the title that single-handedly invented the smartphone-friendly single-button running genre\" and spawned a wave of clones.<ref name=\"newyorker canabalt\">{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/dont-stop-the-game-that-conquered-smartphones | title = DON'T STOP: THE GAME THAT CONQUERED SMARTPHONES | first = Simon | last = Parkin | date = June 7, 2013 | accessdate = December 17, 2016 | work = [[The New Yorker]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161217051533/http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/dont-stop-the-game-that-conquered-smartphones | archive-date = December 17, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-21-temple-run-2-review | title=Temple Run 2 review | work=Eurogamer | date=21 January 2013 | accessdate=February 1, 2013 | author=Faraday, Owen | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202182013/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-21-temple-run-2-review | archive-date=2 February 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> ''[[Fotonica]]'' (2011), a one-button endless runner viewed from the first person, that was described as a \"hybrid of ''[[Canabalt]]''{{'}}s running, ''[[Mirror's Edge]]''{{'}}s perspective (and hands) and ''[[Rez (video game)|Rez]]''{{'}}s visual style\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/01/19/fotonica-you-need-this-game-now/ | title=Fotonica: You Need This Game Now | work=The Sixth Axis | date=January 19, 2011 | accessdate=May 25, 2016 | author=nofi | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616234517/http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/01/19/fotonica-you-need-this-game-now/ | archive-date=June 16, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n''[[Temple Run]]'' (2011) and its successor ''[[Temple Run 2]]'' have become especially popular endless running games.

In a platformer, the [[player character|player controlled character]] must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles. Environments often feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed. The player often has some control over the height and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this [[video game genre|genre]] is the jump button, but now there are other alternatives like swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as swinging from objects such as vines or grappling hooks, as in ''[[Ristar]]'' or ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]'', or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in ''[[Alpha Waves]]''. These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called ''platforming'', a [[verbification]] of ''platform''. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, fall outside of the genre.\n\nPlatform games originated in the early 1980s, which were often about climbing ladders as much as jumping, with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] successors popularized in the mid-1990s. The term describes games where jumping on platforms is an integral part of the [[gameplay]] and came into use after the genre had been established, no later than 1983.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.specusphere.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=232&Itemid=32 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219082328/http://www.specusphere.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=232&Itemid=32 | archivedate=2007-02-19 | title=Gamespeak: A glossary of gaming terms| publisher=Specusphere | date=|accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref><ref name=\"Crash Software Review, Issue 1\">{{cite journal | url=ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/Crash/Catalogue-Issue02/04.jpg | title=Crash Software Review, Issue 1| publisher=Crash Micro Action Games |accessdate=2008-06-14}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres, such as the [[shooter game|shooter]] elements in ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'', [[Beat 'em up]] elements of ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', [[adventure game|adventure]] elements of ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]]'', or [[console RPG|role-playing game]] elements of ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''.\n\nWhile commonly associated with [[console gaming]], there have been many important platform games released to [[video arcade]]s, as well as for [[handheld game console]]s and [[Personal computer|home computers]]. North America, Europe and Japan have played major parts in the genre's evolution. Platform themes range from cartoon-like games to [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] epics.\n\nAt one point, platform games were the most popular genre of video game. At the peak of their popularity, it is estimated that between one-quarter and one-third of console games were platformers,<ref>This estimate is based on the number of platform games released on specific systems. For example, on the [[Master System]], 113 of the 347 games (32.5 percent) listed on vgmuseum.com are platform games, and 264 of the 1044 [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] games (25.2 percent) are platformers</ref> but these have since been supplanted by first-person shooters.<ref>https://www.statista.com/statistics/189592/breakdown-of-us-video-game-sales-2009-by-genre/</ref> As of 2006, the genre had become far less dominant, representing a two percentage market share as compared to fifteen percent in 1998,<ref name=\"detailed cross-examination\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | title=A Detailed Cross-Examination of Yesterday and Today's Best-Selling Platform Games | website=[[Gamasutra]] | date=2006-08-04 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027033801/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | archive-date=2007-10-27 | url-status=live }}</ref> but is still commercially viable, with a number of games selling in the millions of units. Since 2010, a variety of endless running platformers for mobile devices have brought renewed popularity to the genre.\n\n==History==\n\n===Single screen movement===\n[[File:Donkey Kong Screen 3.png|thumb|This ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' (1981) level demonstrates extensive jumping between platforms, the genre's defining trait.]]\n\nPlatform games originated in the late 1970s - early 1980s. Most, but not all, early examples of platform games were confined to a static playing field, generally viewed in profile.\n\n''[[Space Panic]]'', a 1980 arcade release by [[Aruze|Universal]], is sometimes credited as being the first platform game,<ref>{{cite book|title=Chris Crawford on Game Design|isbn=0-88134-117-7|last=Crawford|first=Chris|title-link=Chris Crawford on Game Design|authorlink=Chris Crawford (game designer)|year=2003|publisher=New Riders}}</ref> though the distinction is contentious. While the player has the ability to fall, there is no ability to jump, so the game does not satisfy most modern definitions of the genre. However, it clearly influenced the genre, with gameplay centered on climbing ladders between different floors, a common element in many early platform games. A difficult game to learn, ''Space Panic'' remained obscure as an arcade game, but the 1981 unauthorized clone ''[[Apple Panic]]'' was a hit for home computers.\n\nAnother precursor to the genre from 1980 was [[Nichibutsu]]'s ''[[Crazy Climber]]'', which has the player scaling vertically-scrolling skyscrapers.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=7426|name=Crazy Climber}}</ref>\n\n''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', an [[arcade game]] created by [[Nintendo]] and released in July 1981, was the first game to allow players to jump over obstacles and across gaps, making it the first true platformer.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=donkey-kong&page=detail&id=666| title=Donkey Kong| publisher=Arcade History| date=2006-11-21| accessdate=2006-11-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020111301/http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=donkey-kong&page=detail&id=666| archive-date=2007-10-20| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"GamesRadar-3\">{{cite web|title=Gaming's most important evolutions|page=3|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=Oct 8, 2010|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-3|accessdate=2011-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319153722/http://www.gamesradar.com/gamings-most-important-evolutions/?page=3|archive-date=March 19, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It introduced [[Mario]], a modern icon of the genre, under the name Jumpman.

This title laid the groundwork for other two-player cooperative platformers such as ''[[Fairyland Story]]'' and ''[[Bubble Bobble]]''.\n\nBeginning in 1982, transitional games emerged that did not feature [[scrolling]] graphics, but had levels that spanned [[Flip-screen|several connected screens]]. ''[[Pitfall!]]'', released for the [[Atari 2600]], featured broad, horizontally extended levels. It became one of the best-selling games on the system and was a breakthrough for the genre. ''[[Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle]]'' was released on the [[ColecoVision]] that same year, adding uneven terrain and [[Panning (camera)|scrolling pans]] between static screens. ''[[Manic Miner]]'' (1983) and its sequel ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'' (1984) continued this style of multi-screen levels on [[home computer]]s.

The concept of a platform game as it was defined in its earliest days is somewhat different from how the term is commonly used today.\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', a genre of similarly-styled games emerged characterized by a profile view of tiers connected by ladders.  These included ''[[Kangaroo (video game)|Kangaroo]]'', ''[[Canyon Climber]]'', ''[[Ponpoko]]'', ''[[Miner 2049er]]'', ''[[Lode Runner]]'', and ''[[Jumpman (video game)|Jumpman]]''. The two most common gameplay goals were to get to the top of the screen or to collect all of a particular item, both of which are found in ''Donkey Kong''.  The North American press, including leading magazine ''[[Electronic Games]]'', labeled the genre \"climbing games.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games|journal=Electronic Games|date=January 1983|volume=1|issue=11|page=49|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|access-date=2015-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|archive-date=2016-03-19|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=Steve |title=Video Invaders |date=1982 |publisher=Arco Publishing |isbn=978-0668055208 |page=[https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders/page/n49 29] |url=https://archive.org/details/book_video_invaders}}</ref> London-based ''TV Gamer'' magazine listed \"Climbing\" as a game category in the March 1983 issue, calling ''Donkey Kong'' \"the most famous of all climbing games.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reviews Explained: The Game Categories |journal=TV Gamer |date=March 1983 |page=76 |url=https://archive.org/details/tv-gamer-magazine-1983-03/page/n75?q=climbing+games  |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe terms ''platform game'' and ''platformer'' have since gained wide use in the UK, North America, and across Europe. Since the earliest uses the concept has evolved, particularly as the genre peaked in popularity during the early 1990s. Many of the games that were part of the early platform genre, such as ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Miner 2049er'', are still regarded as platform games in the modern sense.\n\n===Scrolling movement===\n{{see also|Side-scrolling video game}}\n[[File:Jump Bug.png|thumb|''[[Jump Bug]]'' (1981) introduced scrolling to the genre.]]\n\nThe first platform game to use scrolling graphics came years before the genre became a trend.<ref name=\"retro.ign.com\">{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/861/861550p2.html |title=IGN: The Leif Ericson Awards |publisher=Retro.ign.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2013-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041726/http://retro.ign.com/articles/861/861550p2.html |archive-date=2012-03-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Jump Bug]]'' is a platform-shooter developed by [[Alpha Denshi]] under contract for [[Banpresto|Hoei/Coreland]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/retro/retro/review/sa/jumpbug.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412184957/http://www.ne.jp/asahi/retro/retro/review/sa/jumpbug.html | archivedate=2008-04-12 | title=\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30d0\u30b0 \u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3057\u307e\u5c02\u79d1 | publisher= |accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> and released to arcades in 1981, only five months after ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=jump-bug&page=detail&id=1236 | title=Jump Bug | publisher=Arcade History | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007225104/http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=jump-bug&page=detail&id=1236 | archive-date=2012-10-07 | url-status=live }}</ref> Players control a bouncing car that jumps on various platforms such as buildings, clouds, and hills.

The title was bundled with Nintendo systems in North America, Japan, and Europe, and went on to sell over 40 million copies, according to the 1999 [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. Its success as a pack-in led many companies to see platform games as vital to their success, and contributed greatly to popularizing the genre during the [[8-bit era|8-bit console generation]].\n\n[[Sega]] attempted to emulate this success with their ''[[Alex Kidd]]'' series, which began in 1986 on the [[Master System]] with ''[[Alex Kidd in Miracle World]]'', a platformer that features horizontal and vertical scrolling levels, the ability to punch enemies and obstacles, and shops where the player can buy [[power-up]]s and vehicles.

Because of their small size, technical constraints, and blurring associated with the [[LCD]] technology, fast-paced action-based platformers were more difficult to develop for these handheld systems. Because of this, many early handheld platformers leaned towards slower-paced play styles and a greater emphasis on puzzles.\n\nDuring [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|Sixth Generation]] and early [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|Seventh]] generations, home consoles largely transitioned to 3D games and handhelds became a bastion for traditional side-scrolling platform games, until the release of ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

By the time the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] launched, platform games were the most popular genre in home console gaming and were seen as vital for winning the [[console war]]. There was a particular emphasis on having a flagship platform title exclusive to a format, featuring a mascot character. In 1989, Sega released ''[[Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle]]''. The title was only modestly successful, and Sega realized it needed a stronger mascot to move Genesis units. That same year, Capcom released the platformer ''[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]'', which scrolled in multiple directions and allowed the player to summon [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) partners, such as a droid, tiger, and hawk, to help fight enemies.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref> Another Sega release in 1989 was ''[[Shadow Dancer]]'', which also featured an AI partner: a dog who followed the player around and aid in battle.<ref>{{KLOV game|9499|Shadow Dancer}}</ref> In 1990, [[Hudson Soft]] released ''[[Bonk's Adventure]]'', featuring a character that was positioned as [[NEC]]'s mascot.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bonkzonk.com/series.shtml | title=Series Guide | publisher=Bonk Compendium | accessdate=2007-01-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125052034/http://bonkzonk.com/series.shtml | archive-date=2007-01-25 | url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, Takeru's ''[[Cocoron]]'', a late platformer for the Famicom, introduced true character customization, allowing players to build a character from a toy box filled with spare parts.<ref name=\"Playing With Power\"/>\n\n1991 marked the release of the [[Super NES]], along with the eagerly anticipated ''[[Super Mario World]]''.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the [[Amiga]] was known as a stronger gaming platform than [[IBM PC compatibles]], thanks to its more powerful stock [[Original Amiga chipset|video hardware and sound hardware]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a600tech.html | title=Amiga 600 Technical Specifications | publisher=Amiga History|date=December 15, 2002 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref> The [[Atari ST]] was solidly supported as well. Games like ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'' and ''[[Turrican]]'' showed that computer platform games could rival the graphics and sound of their console contemporaries. ''[[Prince of Persia]]'', originally released for the Apple II in 1989, long after that system's heyday, featured an unprecedented level of animation.\n\nThe 1988 shareware game ''[[The Adventures of Captain Comic]]'' was one of the first attempts at a Nintendo-style platformer for IBM PC compatibles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edwards |first1=Benj |title=The 12 Greatest PC Shareware Games of All-Time |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/248494/the_12_greatest_pc_shareware_games_of_all_time.html#slide2 |website=PC World |date=January 22, 2012 |access-date=September 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004212458/https://www.pcworld.com/article/248494/the_12_greatest_pc_shareware_games_of_all_time.html#slide2 |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\nIt inspired ''[[Commander Keen]]'', released by [[id Software]] in 1990, which became the first PC platformer with smooth scrolling graphics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.3drealms.com/keenhistory/|title=A Look Back at Commander Keen|publisher=3DRealms.com|accessdate=2006-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402151326/http://legacy.3drealms.com/keenhistory/|archive-date=2016-04-02|url-status=live}}</ref> Keen's success resulted in numerous console-styled platformers on the PC, including ''[[Duke Nukem (1991 video game)|Duke Nukem]]'', ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', ''[[Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure]]'', and ''[[Dark Ages (1991 video game)|Dark Ages]]'' by [[Apogee Software]], all of which helped fuel the [[shareware]] model of game distribution.\n\n====Decline of 2D====\nThe abundance of platformers for 16-bit consoles continued late into the generation, with successful games such as ''[[Vectorman]]'' (1995), ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'' (1995), and ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' (1995), but the release of new hardware caused players' attention to shift away from traditional 2D genres.<ref name=\"detailed cross-examination\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo 64]] nevertheless featured a number of successful 2D platform games. The 2D ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman]]'' was a big success on 32-bit consoles. ''[[Mega Man 8]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X4]]'' helped revitalize interest in [[Capcom]]'s [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man character]]. ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' revitalized its series and established a new foundation for later ''Castlevania'' games. ''[[Oddworld]]'' and ''[[Heart of Darkness (game)|Heart of Darkness]]'' kept the subgenre born from ''Prince of Persia'' alive.\n\nThe difficulties of adapting platform gameplay to three dimensions led some developers to compromise by pairing the visual flash of 3D with traditional 2D side scrolling gameplay. These games are often referred to as 2.5D.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | title=It's a Viewtiful Day | website=[[Gamasutra]] | date=2004-08-24 | accessdate=2007-01-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027033801/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1851/a_detailed_crossexamination_of_.php | archive-date=2007-10-27 | url-status=live }}</ref> The first such game was the [[Sega Saturn]] [[launch title]], ''[[Clockwork Knight]]'' (1994). The game featured levels and [[boss (video games)|boss]] characters rendered in 3D, but retained 2D gameplay and used pre-rendered 2D sprites for regular characters, similar to ''Donkey Kong Country''. Its [[Clockwork Knight 2|sequel]] improved upon its design, featuring some 3D effects such as hopping between the foreground and background, and the camera panning and curving around corners. Meanwhile, ''[[Pandemonium (video game)|Pandemonium]]'' and ''[[Klonoa]]'' brought the 2.5D style to the [[PlayStation]]. In a break from the past, the Nintendo 64 had the fewest side scrolling platformers with only four; ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''[[Goemon's Great Adventure]]'', and ''[[Mischief Makers]]''\u2014and most met with a tepid response from critics at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/199386-yoshis-story/index.html | title=Yoshi's Story Reviews | publisher=[[GameRankings]] | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402074207/http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/199386-yoshis-story/index.html | archive-date=2009-04-02 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197950-mischief-makers/index.html | title=Mischief Makers Reviews | publisher=[[GameRankings]] | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319075644/http://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197950-mischief-makers/index.html | archive-date=2009-03-19 | url-status=live }}</ref> Despite this, ''Yoshi's Story'' sold over a million copies in the US,<ref name=\"US Platinum Game Chart\"/> and ''Mischief Makers'' rode high on the charts in the months following its release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/backontop.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101112407/http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/backontop.html | archivedate=2009-01-01 | title=N64 Back on Top | last=Johnston | first=Chris | publisher=SF Kosmo (archived from GameSpot) | date=1997-11-06 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/closegap.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175337/http://sfkosmo.classicgaming.gamespy.com/treasure/games/yukeyuke/articles/closegap.html | archivedate=2011-05-25 | title=Sony Closes the Gap | last=Johnston | first=Chris | publisher=SF Kosmo (archived from GameSpot) | date=1997-10-02 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===The third dimension===\nThe term ''3D platformer'' usually refers to games that feature gameplay in three dimensions and polygonal 3D graphics. Games that have 3D gameplay but 2D graphics are usually included under the umbrella of ''[[#Isometric platform game|isometric platformers]]'', while those that have 3D graphics but gameplay on a 2D plane are called ''[[2.5D]]'', as they are a blend of 2D and 3D.\n\nThe first attempts to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and had an [[isometric perspective]]. These games are nearly as old as the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's ''[[Congo Bongo]]'' in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was [[Konami]]'s platform game ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]'',<ref name=KLOV-Antarctic>{{KLOV game|6890|Antarctic Adventure}}</ref> where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles.<ref name=KLOV-Antarctic/><ref name=allgame-Antarctic/><ref name=Moby-Antarctic/> Originally released in 1983 for the [[MSX]] computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year,<ref name=Moby-Antarctic>{{MobyGames|id=/msx/antarctic-adventure|name=Antarctic Adventure}}</ref> including an [[Arcade game|arcade]] version,<ref name=KLOV-Antarctic/> [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]],<ref name=Moby-Antarctic/> and [[ColecoVision]].<ref name=allgame-Antarctic>{{allgame|19267|Antarctic Adventure}}</ref>\n\n1986 saw the release of the sequel to forward-scrolling platformer ''Antarctic Adventure'' called ''[[Penguin Adventure]]'', which was designed by [[Hideo Kojima]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1229899_1124.html|title=KONAMI\u306eMSX\u5f80\u5e74\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u304cWii\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u767b\u5834\u3001\u7b2c2\u5f3e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u300e\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30ae\u30a2\u300f\u306e\u914d\u4fe1\u3082\u6c7a\u5b9a - \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a.com|website=www.famitsu.com|accessdate=16 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030003205/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1229899_1124.html|archive-date=30 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It included more [[action game]] elements, a greater variety of levels, [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] elements such as upgrading equipment,<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/penguin-adventure|name=Penguin Adventure}}</ref> and [[multiple endings]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130127035955/http://gamespot.com/msx/action/penguinadventure/cheats.html Penguin Adventure], [[GameSpot]]</ref>\n\nIn early 1987, [[Square (video game company)|Square]] released ''[[3-D WorldRunner]]'', designed by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Nasir Gebelli]].<ref name=\"nextgen\"/><ref name=WorldRunner/> Using a forward-scrolling effect similar to Sega's 1985 [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] [[rail shooter]] ''[[Space Harrier]]''.<ref name=\"nextgen\">\"Hironobu Sakaguchi: The Man Behind the Fantasies\".

It allowed players to move in all directions, but it did not allow movement along more than one axis at once; the player could move orthogonally but not diagonally. Its characters were [[pre-rendered]] sprites, much like the earlier ''[[Clockwork Knight]]''. The game played very similarly to 2D platformers, but it was considered a true 3D title, and let players walk up walls and on ceilings. It was a moderate success, and spawned a sequel called ''Bug Too!''.\n\nIn 1995, [[Delphine Software]] released a 3D sequel to their popular 2D platformer ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]]''. Entitled ''[[Fade to Black (video game)|Fade to Black]]'', it was the first attempt to bring a popular 2D platform game series into 3D. While it retained the puzzle-oriented level design style and step-based control, and bore a strong resemblance to its predecessor, it did not meet the criteria of a platform game, and was billed as an [[action-adventure game|action adventure]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/fade-to-black/cover-art/gameCoverId,52838/ | title=Fade to Black - DOS Cover Art | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=2007-01-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015142418/http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/fade-to-black/cover-art/gameCoverId,52838/ | archive-date=2007-10-15 | url-status=live }}</ref> It used true 3D characters and set pieces, but its environments were rendered using a rigid engine similar to the one used by ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', in that it could only render square, flat corridors, rather than suspended platforms that could be jumped between. ''Fade to Black'' set the stage for other series, such as ''[[Metroid Prime|Metroid]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'', that gradually shifted away from the traditional platform formula while retaining many of its gameplay conventions.\n\nThere was a great deal of pressure on Sony, Sega, and Nintendo to release mascot platformers before the 1996 holiday season. Sony chose to adopt an existing project by developers [[Naughty Dog]], a small developer at the time, who had recently released the questionable ''[[Way of the Warrior (video game)|Way of the Warrior]]''. The move paid off; their game, ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'', beat Nintendo's new console to market in North America and was released in time for the holiday in Japan. Crash remained Sony's unofficial mascot for the next several years before switching to multi-platform releases in the following console generation.\n\nSega did not fare as well. They had tasked their American studio, [[Sega Technical Institute]], with bringing Sonic the Hedgehog into 3D. Their project, titled ''[[Sonic Xtreme]]'', was to have featured a radically different approach for the series, with an exaggerated [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] camera and multidirectional gameplay reminiscent of ''Bug!''. Its development was rocky, due in part to conflicts with Sega Enterprises in Japan and a rushed schedule, and the game never made it to market.\n\n====True 3D====\nBeginning in the 1990s platforming games began to transform from pseudo-3D to \"true 3D\" experiences, the distinction being constraints on the degree of control the player over the character and camera.  Rendering of 3D environment from angles controlled by the user necessitates that the graphics hardware be sufficiently powerful, and that the art and rendering model of the game can be viewed from an arbitrary angle.  The improvement in graphics technology allowed publishers to produce such games, but introduced several new issues; for example, if the [[virtual camera]] can be positioned arbitrarily, it must be constrained to prevent it from [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]] through the environment.\n\nIn 1991, Nintendo's [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] had conceived of a 3D ''Mario'' game, ''Super Mario FX'', while working on ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]''.<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite journal| date= January 1996| title= The Game Guys - (Spaceworld 1995)| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 80| url= http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html| access-date= 2011-01-25| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110516050826/http://www.zeldalegends.net/index.php?n=interviews&id=1996-01-np080-miya-tezu&m=html| archive-date= 2011-05-16| url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.cheats.ign.com/objects/142/14217644.html |title=IGN: Super Mario FX |publisher=Uk.cheats.ign.com |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2013-01-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001205025/http://uk.cheats.ign.com/objects/142/14217644.html |archivedate=2011-10-01 }}</ref> Miyamoto developed most of the concepts for the game during the era of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and considered using the [[Super FX]] chip to make it a SNES game, but decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the former system's technical limitations.<ref name=\"IGN100-2007\">{{cite web| url=http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216163241/http://top100.ign.com/2007/ign_top_game_5.html| archivedate=2012-02-16| url-status=dead| title=IGN's Top 100 Games of All Time| website=IGN| year=2007| accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref name=nsider>{{cite web| url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=223| title=Profile: Shigeru Miyamoto Chronicles of a Visionary| publisher=N-Sider| author=Grajqevci, Jeton| date=2000-10-09| accessdate=2007-12-05| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232650/http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=223| archive-date=2011-05-14| url-status=live}}</ref> The game was renamed ''Super Mario 64'' and went into development in 1994.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nIn 1994, a small developer called Exact released a game for the [[X68000]] computer called ''Geograph Seal''.

Before then, there was no established paradigm for bringing platform games into 3D. ''Mario 64'' set a new standard, and it was imitated by many subsequent 3D platformers. Its gameplay allowed players to explore open 3D environments with greater freedom than any previous attempt at a 3D platform game. To aid this, Nintendo added an [[analog sticks|analog control stick]] to its Nintendo 64 controller, something which had not been included in a standard console controller since the [[Vectrex]], and which has since become standard on other controllers. This allowed for the finer precision needed for a free perspective. Players no longer followed a linear path to the ends of levels, either, with most levels providing objective-based goals. There were a handful of [[boss fight|boss levels]] that offered more traditional platforming.\n\n''Super Mario 64'' brought a change in the goals of some platformers. In most 2D platformers, the player only had to reach a single goal to complete a level, but in ''Mario 64'' each level contained a mission based structure that rewarded items needed to unlock new areas. Many 3D platformers followed this trend such as ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Spyro the Dragon (video game)|Spyro the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'' creating the \"collect-a-thon\" genre. This allowed for more efficient use of large 3D areas and rewarded the player for thorough exploration of their environment, but also contained less jumping and involved more elements of [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] games.\n\nAs platform games settled into this new free-roaming model, it became necessary for developers to program a dynamic, intelligent camera. This was a non-issue with 2D platformers, which were able to maintain a fixed viewpoint. The addition of a free camera also made it more difficult for players to judge the exact height and distance of platforms, making [[jumping puzzle]]s more difficult. Some of the more linear 3D platformers, like ''[[Tork: Prehistoric Punk]]'' and ''[[Wario World]]'' used scripted cameras that allowed for minimal player control.

Sega finally produced a 3D Sonic game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', on its new [[Dreamcast]] console. It used a hub structure like ''Mario 64'' but featured more linear, action-oriented levels with an emphasis on speed. Although the game was a hit, it was not enough to save the Dreamcast from an early discontinuation in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/090/090862p1.html | title=Sega of Japans Comments on Dreamcast Discontinuance | website=IGN | date=2001-01-31 | accessdate=2007-02-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019010356/http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/090/090862p1.html | archive-date=2007-10-19 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nNintendo launched its [[GameCube]] console without a platform game. However, it released ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' in 2002, the second 3D ''Mario'' game. While the title was well received at the time of its release, it has since received criticism regarding such factors as its short length, lack of location variety, and level design, which featured an abundance of open space, making for a much slower-paced game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejadedgamer.net/review_gcn_supermariosunshine.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125062547/http://www.thejadedgamer.net/review_gcn_supermariosunshine.shtml |archivedate=November 25, 2005 |title=Super Mario Sunshine|last=Maiorana|first=Stephen|publisher=The Jaded Gamer|date=2003-04-25|accessdate=2006-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameshark.com/?s=34ff38a9-a7eb-4d77-a69c-b7bddbfa9fbd&c=gamecube&a=reviews&id=150|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026130719/http://www.gameshark.com/?s=34ff38a9-a7eb-4d77-a69c-b7bddbfa9fbd&c=gamecube&a=reviews&id=150|archivedate=2005-10-26|title=Super Mario Sunshine|last=Larkin|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[GameShark]]|date=2003-04-28|accessdate=2006-11-22}}</ref>\n\nOther notable 3D platformers trickled out during this generation.

[[Electronic Arts]] released ''[[Mirror's Edge]]'', which coupled platform gameplay with a first-person camera, but avoided marketing the game as a [[platformer]] because of the association the label had developed with games geared toward younger audiences.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'' featured stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of platform gameplay; this formula was also used in ''[[Sonic Colors]]'' and ''[[Sonic Generations]]''.

These range from classic revivals such as ''[[Bionic Commando: Rearmed]]'', ''[[Contra ReBirth]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'', to original titles like ''[[Splosion Man]]'' and ''[[Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure]]''. ''[[Wario Land: The Shake Dimension]]'', released in 2008, was a platformer that featured completely two-dimensional graphics and a rich visual style. Subsequent games such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'', ''[[A Boy and His Blob (2009 video game)|A Boy and His Blob]]'', and [[The Behemoth]]'s ''[[BattleBlock Theater]]'' also use completely 2D graphics. ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' is particularly notable, as unlike the majority of 2D platformers in the 21st century, it was a direct release for a non-portable console, and not restricted on a [[content delivery network]]. The success of ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' led to Nintendo releasing similar 2D platformer games for their classic franchises the following year: ''[[Donkey Kong Country Returns]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]''.\n\nIn 2009, independent developer [[Frozenbyte]] released ''[[Trine (video game)|Trine]]'', a [[2.5D]] platform game that mixed traditional elements with more modern physics puzzles. The game proved to be a commercial success, eventually selling more than 1.1 million copies.

In 2012, Nintendo released two more 2D platform games: ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for the 3DS and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' for the [[Wii U]]. Nintendo has also released 3D platform games with gameplay elements of 2D platform games, namely ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' for the 3DS in 2011 and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' for the Wii U in 2013, the latter of which also included [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] gameplay. Each has achieved critical and commercial success.\n\n2017 saw the release of a number of 3D platformers which caused media speculation of a renewal of the genre.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} These games included ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]'' and ''[[A Hat in Time]]'', both of which were [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] on the website [[Kickstarter]]. The release of ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' on the [[Nintendo Switch]], which was an updated return to the open ended gameplay style popularized by ''Super Mario 64'', saw some of the most critical acclaim in the franchise's history. The ''[[Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy]]'' compilation on the [[PlayStation 4]] sold over two million copies worldwide, and some critics noted the increased difficulty from the original PlayStation games.\n\n==Subgenres==\n{{original research|section|date=February 2011}}\nThere are many games that are platformers that do not adhere to any of the subgenres below, but the following are some of the more recognizable archetypes for different platform styles. There are many more vaguely defined subgenres that are not mentioned here because they are not as easily defined.\n\n===Puzzle-platform game===\n{{see also|Puzzle video game}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]'' is a 2012 Puzzle-platformer with puzzles based around a screen rotation mechanic.]]\nPuzzle platformers are characterized by their use of a platform game structure to drive a game whose challenge is derived primarily from [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]]. They normally feature a gimmick which is used throughout the entire game and as the level design becomes more complicated players are tasked with using that gimmick in different ways.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://robsretroreviews.blogspot.com/2016/07/17-sub-genres-of-platformer-games-list.html| title=Archived copy| access-date=2019-01-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109062923/http://robsretroreviews.blogspot.com/2016/07/17-sub-genres-of-platformer-games-list.html| archive-date=2019-01-09| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Enix]]'s 1983 release ''[[Door Door]]'' and Sega's 1985 release ''[[Doki Doki Penguin Land]]'' (for the [[SG-1000]]) are perhaps the first examples, though the genre is diverse, and classifications can vary. ''[[Doki Doki Penguin Land]]'' allowed players to run and jump in typical platform fashion, but they could also destroy blocks, and were tasked with guiding an egg to the bottom of the level without letting it break.\n\n''[[The Lost Vikings]]'' (1992) was one of the more popular titles in this genre, as well. It featured three characters players could switch between, each with different abilities. Players had to use all three characters to reach the level goals.\n\nThis subgenre has a strong presence on handheld platforms. ''[[Wario Land 2]]'' moved the Wario series into the puzzle-platformer genre by eliminating the element of death and adding temporary injuries, such as being squashed or lit on fire, and specialized powers. ''[[Wario Land 3]]'' continued this tradition, while ''[[Wario Land 4]]'' was more of a mix of puzzle and traditional platform elements. The [[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Game Boy update of ''Donkey Kong'']] was also a successful portable puzzle-platformer, and saw a sequel on Game Boy Advance called ''[[Mario vs Donkey Kong]]''. ''[[Klonoa: Empire of Dreams]]'', the first handheld title in its series, was also a puzzle-platformer.\n\nIn more recent years, the genre has experienced some revival, especially in independent game development. ''Braid'' uses time manipulation for its puzzles, and ''[[And Yet It Moves]]'' uses [[frame of reference]] rotation.  In contrast to these [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrollers]], ''[[Narbacular Drop]]'' and its successor, ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' are first-person camera games that use portals to solve puzzles in 3D. Since the release of ''Portal'', there have been more puzzle platformers that use a first-person camera, including ''Purity'' and ''[[Tag: The Power of Paint]]''.\n\n===Run-and-gun platform game===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Broforce four players.png|thumb|right|''[[Broforce]]'' is a run-and-gun platform game that spoofs on several [[action film]] heroes]]\nThe [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] platformer genre was popularized by [[Konami]]'s classic ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''. ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'' and ''[[Metal Slug]]'' are also among the most popular examples of this style. Side-scrolling run and gun games are an attempt to marry platform games with [[shoot 'em up]]s, characterized by a minimal focus on precise platform jumping and a major emphasis on multi-directional shooting. These games are sometimes called platform shooters. This genre has strong arcade roots, and as such, these games are generally known for being very difficult, and having very linear, one-way game progression.\n\nThere are games which feature a heavy degree of shooting but do not fall into this subgenre. ''[[Mega Man (video game)|Mega Man]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'', ''[[Vectorman]]'', ''[[Jazz Jackrabbit]]'', ''[[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]]'', ''[[Cuphead]]'' and ''[[Turrican]]'' are all platformers with a heavy focus on action and shooting, but unlike ''Contra'' or ''Metal Slug'', platform jumping elements, as well as exploration and back-tracking, still figure prominently. Run and guns are generally very pure, and while they may have vehicular sequences or other changes in style, they stay focused on shooting throughout.\n\n===Cinematic platform game===\n[[File:Another World platform game.gif|thumb|''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'', like other cinematic platformers, features a realistically proportioned character and rotoscoped animation.]]\nCinematic platformers are a small but distinct subgenre of platform games, usually distinguished by their relative realism compared to traditional platformers.  These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platform games.<ref name=\"Bexander2014\" /> To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'', have employed [[rotoscoping]] techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts.<ref name=Therrien /> Jumping abilities are typically roughly within the confines of an athletic human's capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of elevator platforms.<ref name=\"Bexander2014\" /> Other distinguishing characteristics include step-based control, in which an action is performed after the character completes his current animation, rather than the instant the button is pressed, and multi-screen stages that do not scroll.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAs these games tend to feature vulnerable characters who may die as the result of a single enemy attack or by falling a relatively short distance, they almost never have limited lives or continues. Challenge is derived from [[trial and error]] problem solving, forcing the player to find the right way to overcome a particular obstacle.<ref name=\"LaLone12\" />\n\n''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' was the first cinematic platformer and perhaps the most influential.<ref name=Rybicki08 /> ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' pioneered many of the defining elements of cinematic platformers and is an important precursor to this genre.<ref name=\"Retro122\" /> Other games in the genre include ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]]'' (and its 2013  [[Flashback (2013 video game)|remake]]), ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'', ''[[Heart of Darkness (video game)|Heart of Darkness]]'', the first two ''[[Oddworld]]'' games, ''[[Blackthorne]]'', ''[[Bermuda Syndrome]]'', ''[[Generations Lost]]'', ''[[Heart of the Alien]]'', ''[[Weird Dreams]]'', ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]'', ''[[Inside (video game)|Inside]]'', ''[[onEscapee]]'', ''[[Deadlight]]'', ''[[Rain World]]'' and [[The Way (video game)|The Way]].\n\n===Comical action game/Single Screen Platformer===\nThis genre lacks a commonly agreed upon name in the West, but games in the genre are most commonly called \"comical action games\" (CAGs) in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=2216&image=2 | title=Arcade Flyers: Cover Art | publisher=arcadeflyers.com | accessdate=2007-01-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904030844/http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=2216&image=2 | archive-date=2015-09-04 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=3390&image=2 | title=Arcade Flyers Cover Art | publisher=arcadeflyers.com | accessdate=2007-01-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904030844/http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&id=3390&image=2 | archive-date=2015-09-04 | url-status=live }}</ref> The original arcade ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' is generally recognized as the originator of this genre, though ''[[Bubble Bobble]]'' is also highly influential. These games are characterized by single screen, non-scrolling levels and often contain cooperative two-player action. A level is cleared when all enemies on the screen have been defeated, and vanquished foes usually drop score bonuses in the form of fruit or other items. CAGs are almost exclusively developed in Japan and are either arcade games, or sequels to arcade games, though they are also a common genre among amateur [[dojin soft|''doujinshi'']] games. Other examples include ''[[Don Doko Don]]'', ''[[Snow Bros]]'' and ''[[Nightmare in the Dark]]''.\n\n===Isometric platform game===\n{{anchor|Isometric platformers|reason=Old section name; things linked to it.}}\n{{see also|Isometric graphics in video games}}{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}[[File:Knight Lore for MSX.gif|thumb|''[[Knight Lore]]'', an example of three-dimensional space represented on low-end hardware]]\n\nArguably a subgenre of both 3D and 2D platformers, isometric platformers present a three-dimensional environment using two-dimensional graphics in [[isometric projection]]. Although not the first [[Isometric graphics in video games|isometric games]], the earliest examples of isometric platform games are the arcade game ''[[Congo Bongo]]'' and ''[[Ant Attack]]'' for the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], both released in 1983.\n\n''[[Knight Lore]]'', an isometric sequel to ''[[Sabre Wulf]]'', helped to establish the conventions of early isometric platformers. This formula was repeated in later games like ''[[Head Over Heels (game)|Head Over Heels]]'' and ''[[Monster Max]]''. These games were generally heavily focused on exploring indoor environments, usually a series of small rooms connected by doors, and have distinct adventure and puzzle elements. Japanese developers blended this gameplay style with that of Japanese [[action-adventure game]]s like ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' to create games like ''[[Land Stalker]]'' and ''[[Light Crusader]]''. While these games are more generally classified as action adventures, they are also isometric platformers and an evolution of earlier conventions in the genre. This influence later traveled to Europe with Adeline Software's sprawling epic ''[[Little Big Adventure]]'', which blended RPG, [[adventure game|adventure]], and isometric platforming elements.\n\nBefore consoles were able to display true polygonal 3D graphics, the \u00be isometric perspective was used to move some popular 2D platformers into three-dimensional gameplay. ''[[Spot Goes To Hollywood]]'' was a sequel to the popular ''[[Cool Spot]]'', and ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' was Sonic's outing into the isometric subgenre.\n\n===Platform-adventure game===\n{{see also|Metroidvania}}\nMany games fuse platform game fundamentals with elements of [[action-adventure game]]s, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', or with elements of [[Role-playing video games|RPGs]]. Typically these elements include the ability to explore an area freely, with access to new areas granted by either gaining new abilities or using inventory items. Many 2D games in the ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' franchises are among the most popular games of this sort, and so games that take this type of approach are often labeled as \"[[Metroidvania]]\" games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/20/these-metroidvania-games-are-neither-metroid-nor-vania/ | author=Fletcher, JC | title=These Metroidvania games are

Game controls are limited to making the character jump, attack, or perform special actions. The object of these games is to get as far as possible before the character dies. Endless running games have found particular success on mobile platforms. They are well-suited to the small set of controls these games require, often limited to a single screen tap for jumping. Games with similar mechanics with automatic forward movement, but where levels have been pre-designed, or procedurally generated to have a set finish line, are often called \"auto-runners\" to distinguish them from endless runners.\n\nGame designer Scott Rogers named [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling shooter]]s like ''[[Scramble (video game)|Scramble]]'' (1981) and ''[[Moon Patrol]]'' (1982) and chase-style gameplay in platform games like ''[[Disney's Aladdin (1994 video game)|Disney's Aladdin]]'' (1994 8-bit version) and ''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' (1996) as forerunners of the genre.<ref name=Swipe>''Swipe This!: The Guide to Great Touchscreen Game Design'' by Scott Rogers, Wiley and Sons, 2012</ref> ''[[B.C.'s Quest for Tires]]'' (1983) is considered to be the first game with elements of the endless runner, but at the time, the format never took off.<ref name=\"newyorker canabalt\"/>\n\nIn February 2003, Gamevil published ''Nom'' for mobile phones in Korea. The game's designer Sin Bong-gu, stated that he wanted to create a game that was only possible on mobile phones, therefore he made the player character walk up walls and ceilings, requiring players to turn around their mobile phones while playing. To compensate for this complication, he limited the game's controls to a single button and let the character run automatically and indefinitely, \"like the people in modern society, who must always look forward and keep running\".<ref>{{cite web |date=May 28, 2004 |url=http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2004052802011468700002 |first=Ji-suk |last=Han |title=[Geim Keurieiteo] Geimbil 'Nom' gihoek Sin Bong-gu siljang |script-title=ko:[\uac8c\uc784 \ud06c\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc774\ud130] \uac8c\uc784\ube4c `\ub188` \uae30\ud68d \uc2e0\ubd09\uad6c \uc2e4\uc7a5 |trans-title=[Game Creator] Director Sin Bong-Gu, planner of Gamevil's `Nom` |language=ko |publisher=DigitalTimes |website=DigitalTimes |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709103137/http://www.dt.co.kr/contents.html?article_no=2004052802011468700002 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhile the concept thus was long known in Korea, journalists credit ''[[Canabalt]]'' (2009) as \"the title that single-handedly invented the smartphone-friendly single-button running genre\" and spawned a wave of clones.<ref name=\"newyorker canabalt\">{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/dont-stop-the-game-that-conquered-smartphones | title = DON'T STOP: THE GAME THAT CONQUERED SMARTPHONES | first = Simon | last = Parkin | date = June 7, 2013 | accessdate = December 17, 2016 | work = [[The New Yorker]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161217051533/http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/dont-stop-the-game-that-conquered-smartphones | archive-date = December 17, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-21-temple-run-2-review | title=Temple Run 2 review | work=Eurogamer | date=21 January 2013 | accessdate=February 1, 2013 | author=Faraday, Owen | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202182013/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-21-temple-run-2-review | archive-date=2 February 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> ''[[Fotonica]]'' (2011), a one-button endless runner viewed from the first person, that was described as a \"hybrid of ''[[Canabalt]]''{{'}}s running, ''[[Mirror's Edge]]''{{'}}s perspective (and hands) and ''[[Rez (video game)|Rez]]''{{'}}s visual style\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/01/19/fotonica-you-need-this-game-now/ | title=Fotonica: You Need This Game Now | work=The Sixth Axis | date=January 19, 2011 | accessdate=May 25, 2016 | author=nofi | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616234517/http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/01/19/fotonica-you-need-this-game-now/ | archive-date=June 16, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n''[[Temple Run]]'' (2011) and its successor ''[[Temple Run 2]]'' have become especially popular endless running games.

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming the singer's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features an [[AIBO]], a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was also performed during four of the singer's concert tours, and her 2019 Las Vegas residency, [[Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Action Jackson|magazine=[[USA Weekend]]|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Janet at the Crossroads|last=Norment|first=Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|volume=41|number=1|page=181|date=November 2000|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. She decided to write an uptempo love song rather than a [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]], inspired by Segal finding her love for Murphy's unattractive character in the film convincing.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/>\n\nThe lyrics of \"Doesn't Really Matter\" were based on a poem Jackson found which she previously wrote and disposed of.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> The poem's lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> After an early version of the song was created, Jackson requested Jam and Richburg to add more instrumentation, however Jam decided to record from [[Broadcasting#Recorded and live forms|live to tape]] after Richburg left the studio.<ref name=\"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine|last=Rule|first=Greg|date=November 2000|title=Jimmy Jam: Inside Flyte Tyme studios|magazine=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]|volume=26|issue=11|pages=32-40|issn=07300158}}</ref> Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nTwo different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track.

During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls.

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming the singer's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features an [[AIBO]], a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was also performed during four of the singer's concert tours, and her 2019 Las Vegas residency, [[Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Action Jackson|magazine=[[USA Weekend]]|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Janet at the Crossroads|last=Norment|first=Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|volume=41|number=1|page=181|date=November 2000|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. She decided to write an uptempo love song rather than a [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]], inspired by Segal finding her love for Murphy's unattractive character in the film convincing.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/>\n\nThe lyrics of \"Doesn't Really Matter\" were based on a poem Jackson found which she previously wrote and disposed of.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> The poem's lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> After an early version of the song was created, Jackson requested Jam and Richburg to add more instrumentation, however Jam decided to record from [[Broadcasting#Recorded and live forms|live to tape]] after Richburg left the studio.<ref name=\"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine|last=Rule|first=Greg|date=November 2000|title=Jimmy Jam: Inside Flyte Tyme studios|magazine=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]|volume=26|issue=11|pages=32-40|issn=07300158}}</ref> Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nTwo different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack. He chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\".

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

{"title_page": "Cash game", "text_new": "'''Cash games''', also sometimes referred to as '''ring games''' or '''live action games''', are [[poker]] games played with \"real\" [[Poker chip|chips]] and money at stake, often with no predetermined end time, with players able to enter and leave as they see fit.  In contrast, a [[poker tournament]] is played with tournament chips worth nothing outside the tournament, with a definite end condition (usually, only one player left), and a specific roster of competitors.\n\n==Rules==\nPlayers may freely buy into or [[cash]] out of a cash game between hands.<ref name=\"OPFAQ\">[http://www.onlinepokerfaq.com/guide/game-types.html Kinds of games: Ring games vs. tournaments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204040201/http://www.onlinepokerfaq.com/guide/game-types.html |date=February 4, 2010 }}</ref> However, it is normally prohibited for a player to remove a portion of his or her chips from the table. This is known as \"[[Poker jargon#going south|going south]]\".<ref name=\"PokerMag\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20050408190403/http://www.pokermagazine.com/Poker-Rules/poker_chips_etiquette.html Faith, Hope and Ratholing]</ref> For example, if a player buys in for $100, then wins $100 (for a total stack of $200), the player may not remove the original $100 buy-in while remaining seated. He would have to forfeit his seat, possibly wait to rejoin the game, and buy in again for $100; however, many cardrooms prohibit the practice of buying in again unless a certain time period has elapsed before the player rejoins. Similarly, cash games are played for [[Betting (poker)#Table_stakes_rules|table stakes]]. If a player attempts to put additional money onto the table (from his/her wallet) in the middle of a hand, he may not do so until the conclusion of said hand.\n\nIn \"no limit\" poker cash games, some cardrooms have a maximum buy-in for cash games.  In limit poker games, there is seldom a maximum buy-in because betting limits already limit the amount a player can wager on each hand.   \n\nIn a [[casino]], a [[Rake (poker)|rake]] is usually taken from a pot if a flop is shown and the pot reaches certain values.<ref name=\"TV\">[http://thinvalue.co.uk/calculate-rake-poker/ How to Calculate the Rake in Poker]</ref>  Some games take a time rake instead of a pot rake.  In these games players pay a seat charge every half-hour.\n\n==Ring games==\nWhile the terms \"ring game\" and \"cash game\" are often considered synonymous in common usage, opinion differs on the true definition of \"ring game\".  For example, in the glossary of [[Doyle Brunson]]'s ''[[Super System 2]]'', a ring game is defined as \"''A game with a player in every seat, that is, a full game\u2014as opposed to a shorthanded game''\".<ref name=\"Super System 2\">{{cite book | author=Doyle Brunson| year=2005 | title=Super System 2 | chapter=Glossary | others= | pages=[https://archive.org/details/doylebrunsonssup00brun/page/663 663] | publisher=Cardoza Publishing | id= | url=https://archive.org/details/doylebrunsonssup00brun| url-access=registration| authorlink= |display-authors=etal}}</ref>  As such, the term \"cash game\" may be considered a more precise depiction of the kind of game commonly found in most casinos or home venues; that is, a non-tournament game played for actual money (or chips representing actual money), without regard for the number of players seated at the table at any given time.\n\n==Tournament games==\nTournaments and cash games have different basic strategies. One difference between tournaments and cash games is that the blind/ante structure of tournaments increases periodically over the course of the tournament, whereas the blind/ante structure of cash games remains constant. Another difference between the tournaments and cash games is that a tournament sticks with a predetermined style of poker, and cash game players, depending on [[Public cardroom rules|house rules]], may have the option of playing other types of card games.  Some [[online poker|online cash games]] offer a variety of choices limited only by the game software.\n\nOther differences between cash games and tournament poker are that, in cash games sometimes [[betting (poker)#Straddle bets|straddles]] and [[chopping the blinds|chops]] are allowed. A live straddle is a dark bet of two big blinds by the player first to act, who is then entitled to bet again if the bet is not raised. A chop is an agreement between the players in the blinds to retract their blind bets if no one else has bet. A chop prevents the casino from taking a rake from the pot. Also, cash games sometimes allow players to reduce the element of luck (often called \"[[variance]]\", especially by professional players) by splitting large all-in pots. Since online platforms can instantly calculate each player's pot [[equity]] at the time they go all-in, some online cash games allow such pots to be split based on this equity. Players who opt for such an arrangement will receive a share of the pot based on his or her odds of winning (from the time all players still in the pot exposed their cards) once all of the cards have been dealt. An alternative method of reducing variance, used both online and in live games running the board multiple times to ensure that the person with the best odds of winning gets the largest share of the pot more often.\n\n==Examples==\nAn example of a cash game is broadcast on the [[United States]] [[television network]] [[Game Show Network|GSN]] as ''[[High Stakes Poker]]''.  The [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio casino]]'s \"[[Big Game (poker)|Big Game]]\" is a famous high-stakes permanent cash game, featuring a wide variety of rotating poker games with and without limits.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cash Game}}\n[[Category:Poker gameplay and terminology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Cash games''', also sometimes referred to as '''ring games''' or '''live action games''', are [[poker]] games played with \"real\" [[Poker chip|chips]] and money at stake, often with no predetermined end time, with players able to enter and leave as they see fit.

This is known as \"[[Poker jargon#going south|going south]]\".<ref name=\"PokerMag\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20050408190403/http://www.pokermagazine.com/Poker-Rules/poker_chips_etiquette.html Faith, Hope and Ratholing]</ref> For example, if a player buys in for $100, then wins $100 (for a total stack of $200), the player may not remove the original $100 buy-in while remaining seated. He would have to forfeit his seat, possibly wait to rejoin the game, and buy in again for $100; however, many cardrooms prohibit the practice of buying in again unless a certain time period has elapsed before the player rejoins. Similarly, cash games are played for [[Betting (poker)#Table_stakes_rules|table stakes]]. If a player attempts to put additional money onto the table (from his/her wallet) in the middle of a hand, he may not do so until the conclusion of said hand.\n\nIn \"no limit\" poker cash games, some cardrooms have a maximum buy-in for cash games.  In limit poker games, there is seldom a maximum buy-in because betting limits already limit the amount a player can wager on each hand.   \n\nIn a [[casino]], a [[Rake (poker)|rake]] is usually taken from a pot if a flop is shown and the pot reaches certain values.<ref name=\"TV\">[http://thinvalue.co.uk/calculate-rake-poker/ How to Calculate the Rake in Poker]</ref>  Some games take a time rake instead of a pot rake.  In these games players pay a seat charge every half-hour.\n\n==Ring games==\nWhile the terms \"ring game\" and \"cash game\" are often considered synonymous in common usage, opinion differs on the true definition of \"ring game\".  For example, in the glossary of [[Doyle Brunson]]'s ''[[Super System 2]]'', a ring game is defined as \"''A game with a player in every seat, that is, a full game\u2014as opposed to a shorthanded game''\".<ref name=\"Super System 2\">{{cite book | author=Doyle Brunson| year=2005 | title=Super System 2 | chapter=Glossary | others= | pages=[https://archive.org/details/doylebrunsonssup00brun/page/663 663] | publisher=Cardoza Publishing | id= | url=https://archive.org/details/doylebrunsonssup00brun| url-access=registration| authorlink= |display-authors=etal}}</ref>  As such, the term \"cash game\" may be considered a more precise depiction of the kind of game commonly found in most casinos or home venues; that is, a non-tournament game played for actual money (or chips representing actual money), without regard for the number of players seated at the table at any given time.\n\n==Tournament games==\nTournaments and cash games have different basic strategies. One difference between tournaments and cash games is that the blind/ante structure of tournaments increases periodically over the course of the tournament, whereas the blind/ante structure of cash games remains constant. Another difference between the tournaments and cash games is that a tournament sticks with a predetermined style of poker, and cash game players, depending on [[Public cardroom rules|house rules]], may have the option of playing other types of card games.  Some [[online poker|online cash games]] offer a variety of choices limited only by the game software.\n\nOther differences between cash games and tournament poker are that, in cash games sometimes [[betting (poker)#Straddle bets|straddles]] and [[chopping the blinds|chops]] are allowed. A live straddle is a dark bet of two big blinds by the player first to act, who is then entitled to bet again if the bet is not raised. A chop is an agreement between the players in the blinds to retract their blind bets if no one else has bet. A chop prevents the casino from taking a rake from the pot. Also, cash games sometimes allow players to reduce the element of luck by splitting large all-in pots or running the board multiple times to ensure that the person with the best odds of winning gets the largest share of the pot more often.\n\n==Examples==\nAn example of a cash game is broadcast on the [[United States]] [[television network]] [[Game Show Network|GSN]] as ''[[High Stakes Poker]]''.  The [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio casino]]'s \"[[Big Game (poker)|Big Game]]\" is a famous high-stakes permanent cash game, featuring a wide variety of rotating poker games with and without limits.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cash Game}}\n[[Category:Poker gameplay and terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Rupertslander", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTournament games", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_game"}
