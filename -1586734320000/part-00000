The station was owned by [[Equity Media Holdings]] of [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]]. WBLU's signal was broadcast from downtown Lexington and provided coverage that did not extend far past the developed portions of the city, although the signal could be picked up in neighboring [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott]] and [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon]] counties.\n\nThere was a [[construction permit]] to boost the current power of 4&nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]] to 42&nbsp;kW on channel 62, which would have increased the viewing area into the neighboring cities that touch Lexington. The signal upgrade never took place as, while the station as a low-power broadcaster would not have been required to broadcast in the new [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] format at that time, channel 62 was reassigned for non-television use after the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] for [[Full service (radio format)|full service]] stations was completed in 2009. Other further complications, including the station's ownership, also meant that the application would never be regarded as a serious effort.\n\n==History==\n===Previous use of frequency in market===\n{{main|WLKT-TV}}\nThe channel 62 frequency was originally used WBLG-TV (later re-called as [[WTVQ-DT|WTVQ-TV]]) from 1968 until 1980, when that station relocated to channel 36.\n\nAfter WTVQ moved to channel 36, several organizations began to petition to re-use the frequency in hope of making it the fourth television station broadcasting out of Lexington (aside from [[Kentucky Educational Television|KET]]). Way of the Cross, Inc., which wanted to use it for [[Religious broadcasting|Christian broadcasting]], was initially awarded the license, but, in 1983, channel 62 was awarded to Family Broadcasting Co., Inc., a for-profit group, due to their ability to build a stronger transmitter, which would carry the signal further into Eastern Kentucky. In 1986, a settlement between Way of the Cross and FBC was reached, which would allow Way of the Cross to broadcast 15 hours of religious programming each week, plus part-ownership of the station, while FBC would construct the station.\n\nHowever, [[WDKY-TV]] (channel 56), licensed to [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]], found a less arduous path to come to air. It launched in February 1986 and several months later became a charter affiliate of the new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network and located their studios in Lexington, effectively muting any impact channel 62 could make; it remained silent into 1987 and most of 1988.\n\nFinally, after more than seven years of legal battles, the station, called as [[WLKT-TV]], went on the air on October 15, 1988 under FBC's ownership, giving Lexington two independent stations. The studio and offices were located in a small shopping center at 124 New Circle Road, Northeast. The transmitter was located on Clintonville Road, {{convert|3|mi|km|0|spell=in}} north of [[U.S. Route 60 in Kentucky|U.S. 60]], in [[Clark County, Kentucky|Clark County]].\n\nIt made little to no impact in Lexington, quickly losing money and unable to compete in any way with WDKY, and was stunted by the Family Broadcasting settlement deeming they controlled fifteen hours of the station's schedule weekly, devoted to religious programming. The signal also was limited to the core Lexington area. WLKT ceased operations at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. on June 30, 1989.<ref>\"WLKT'S DEMISE THE DECLINE AND FALL OF CHANNEL 62\" by Tom Daykin, Lexington Herald-Leader, p. E1 (Business Section), July 9, 1989.</ref>\n\n===WBLU-LP===\n====UPN and WB affiliations====\nChannel 62 returned to the air on May 3, 1999, when B&C Communications first signed on WBLU, serving as a low-power translator station of [[WUPX-TV|WAOM]] (channel 67), which was licensed to [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]], but mainly served the eastern portion of the market; WBLU thus provided the main signal source for WAOM in Lexington. The station was a [[UPN]] affiliate, airing [[infomercial]]s and syndicated reruns outside of the network's hours.\n\nIn September 1999, WAOM/WBLU added [[The WB]] as a secondary affiliation. The station aired WB programs off-schedule, weeknights at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. and on weekends. Though the actual airtime of programs promoted by the network could have easily been inserted via a voiceover or on-screen notation (as some dual-network affiliates carrying The WB out of pattern such as [[WZPX-TV]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]] did), the station instead crudely removed the promos wholesale while running the network's programming. In 2001, WAOM was sold to [[Ion Media|Paxson Communications]], which converted it to their [[Ion Television|Pax TV]] network (under new callsign WUPX-TV). Paxson determined that they would depend mainly on cable carriage to cover Lexington and did not purchase WBLU-LP. This effectively left the former translator station alone as a WB/UPN affiliate with a small signal range confined only to Lexington proper. The WB affiliation ended in September 2003, after [[Campbellsville, Kentucky|Campbellsville]]-licensed [[WBKI-TV (1983\u20132017)|WBKI-TV]] became the WB affiliate for the Lexington market upon moving their transmitter to be equidistant between [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and Lexington.\n\n====Period of independence and beginning of struggles====\nIn September of 2004, WBLU lost its UPN affiliation when [[WKYT-TV]] established its second digital subchannel, \"UKYT\" (now \"[[WKYT-TV#WKYT-DT2|CWKYT]]\"). WBLU then became an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] which struggled to maintain programming for the next two years. Timeslots outside of syndication were filled with [[infomercial|paid programming]] and [[public domain]] [[feature film|movies]], some of which were acquired only minutes before airtime from the \"dollar [[DVD]]\" section of a nearby [[Walmart]].<ref name = \"DXLD\">{{Cite web\n  | last = Hauser\n  | first = Glenn\n  | title = DX Listening Digest 7-082\n  | date = July 14, 2007\n  | url= http://www.w4uvh.net/dxld7082.txt\n  | accessdate =August 31, 2010}}\n</ref>\n\n====MyNetworkTV affiliation====\nWBLU was purchased by Equity Broadcasting in August 2006, which began to [[centralcasting|centralcast]] the station from their Little Rock headquarters, ending any local staffing of the station at the end of 2006. On September 5, 2006, the station became a charter affiliate of [[MyNetworkTV]] without any consideration of becoming part of [[The CW]], as Equity refused to affiliate any of their stations with that network. Equity also added programming from the [[Retro Television Network]] (which it owned at that time) to fill out the remainder of the broadcast day, discontinuing any other syndicated programming.\n\nWBLU-LP went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]] on or about July 22, 2008 due to what Equity described as \"intermittent signal delivery issues\" via satellite from Little Rock.<ref>http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101267330&formid=910&fac_num=58985</ref> The station reportedly resumed broadcasting on October 1, 2008. As mentioned above, the station did have a [[construction permit]] to move to digital operations, but for most of their stations, Equity never even made any serious attempt to build a digital facility out due to liquidity issues, and many of their stations went dark after the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital transition]] on June 12, 2009 due to a lack of any digital facility to transition to (though WBLU-LP as a low-power station would have been able to remain on the air with an analog signal up until 2021 at the very latest).\n\n====Decline and end of operations====\nThe station lost its MyNetworkTV affiliation on October 31, 2008 due to both dissatisfaction by the network, and viewer complaints about the loss of ''[[WWE Smackdown|WWE Friday Night Smackdown]]'' from WKYT-DT2 after its move to MyNetworkTV; unlike that CW affiliate, WBLU-LP was never carried on any local pay television services, nor had Equity communicated in any way with local providers to add the station (this was despite most of Equity's stations, including WBLU-LP, being freely available through [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] satellite, negating any need to depend on WBLU-LP's transmitter for a quality signal).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article43980198.html|title=WWE Smackdown could move to another station|last=Sloan|first=Scott|date=15 October 2008|work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> Communication between local media, MyNetworkTV and Equity (which was infamous for having little to no presence of any local non-engineering staff for their stations, running almost all operations remotely from Little Rock) was non-existent to the point that the market's [[professional wrestling]] fans placed paid advertising in the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' expressing their frustration,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/latest-news/article44010777.html|title='SmackDown' hits Lexington for TV taping|last=Sloan|first=Scott|date=12 October 2009|work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> forcing the hand of MyNetworkTV to affiliate on a station viewable both over-the-air and on cable in a critical [[WWE]] market.

Though Luken promised to find a new affiliate for the network immediately,<ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com/articles/2009/01/05/daily.5/ TV Newsday: \"Financial Dispute Disrupts RTN Diginet\", 1/5/2009.]</ref> it has never returned to the Lexington market.\n\nFor two months, the station carried a loop of Equity's last-resort network [[Retro Jams]], which carried [[music video]]s, but without any network to affiliate with or local advertising revenue coming in, the future of the station as a going concern quickly declined. WBLU-LP ended up going dark permanently on March 4, 2009, five months after the loss of MyNetworkTV.\n\nWBLU was sold at auction to the [[Daystar (TV network)|Daystar Television Network]] on April 16, 2009 with several other Equity stations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article43999467.html|title=WBLU sold to Christian network|last=Sloan|first=Scott|date=18 May 2009|work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"tvbr-auctiondaystar\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/14101.html|title=Takers found for 60 Equity stations|date=April 18, 2009|work=Television Business Report|accessdate=April 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424220318/http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/14101.html|archive-date=April 24, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_list.pl?Facility_id=58985</ref> However, Daystar was already carried on most cable systems in the Lexington market.

As mentioned above, the station did have a [[construction permit]] to move to digital operations, but for most of their stations, Equity never even made any serious attempt to build a digital facility out due to liquidity issues, and many of their stations went dark after the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital transition]] on June 12, 2009 due to a lack of any digital facility to transition to (though WBLU-LP as a low-power station would have been able to remain on the air with an analog signal up until 2021 at the very latest).\n\n====Decline and end of operations====\nThe station lost its MyNetworkTV affiliation on October 31, 2008 due to both dissatisfaction by the network, and viewer complaints about the loss of ''[[WWE Smackdown|WWE Friday Night Smackdown]]'' from WKYT-DT2 after its move to MyNetworkTV; unlike that CW affiliate, WBLU-LP was never carried on any local pay television services, nor had Equity communicated in any way with local providers to add the station (this was despite most of Equity's stations, including WBLU-LP, being freely available through [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] satellite, negating any need to depend on WBLU-LP's transmitter for a quality signal).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article43980198.html|title=WWE Smackdown could move to another station|last=Sloan|first=Scott|date=15 October 2008|work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> Communication between local media, MyNetworkTV and Equity (which was infamous for having little to no presence of any local non-engineering staff for their stations, running almost all operations remotely from Little Rock) was non-existent to the point that the market's [[professional wrestling]] fans placed paid advertising in the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' expressing their frustration,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/latest-news/article44010777.html|title='SmackDown' hits Lexington for TV taping|last=Sloan|first=Scott|date=12 October 2009|work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref> forcing the hand of MyNetworkTV to affiliate on a station viewable both over-the-air and on cable in a critical [[WWE]] market.

Though Luken promised to find a new affiliate for the network immediately,<ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com/articles/2009/01/05/daily.5/ TV Newsday: \"Financial Dispute Disrupts RTN Diginet\", 1/5/2009.]</ref> it has never returned to the Lexington market.\n\nFor two months, the station carried a loop of Equity's last-resort network [[Retro Jams]], which carried [[music video]]s, but without any network to affiliate with or local advertising revenue coming in, the future of the station as a going concern quickly declined.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (i.e. vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissae (i.e. horizontally)\u2014the curve obtained a series of maximums and minimums\u2014the most [[electropositive]] elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights. In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 1<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies. He was declared the 'holy doctor' and 'one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church', and his writings were proclaimed 'the infallible guide of the Christian Faith'.

It is to focus one's mind on God and pray to God unceasingly.\n\nUnder church tradition the practice of Hesychasm has it beginnings in the bible, Matthew 6:6 and the [[Philokalia]]. The tradition of contemplation with inner silence or tranquility is shared by all Eastern [[ascetics|asceticism]] having its roots in the Egyptian traditions of monasticism exemplified by such Orthodox monastics as [[Anthony the Great|St Anthony of Egypt]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, Gregory Sinaita learned hesychasm from Arsenius of Crete and spread the doctrine, bringing it to the monks on [[Mount Athos]].<ref name=Vailhe/>  The terms ''Hesychasm'' and ''Hesychast'' were used by the monks on [[Mount Athos]] to refer to the practice and to the practitioner of a method of mental ascesis that involves the use of the Jesus Prayer assisted by certain psychophysical techniques.  The hesychasts stated that at higher stages of their prayer practice they reached the actual [[theoria|contemplation-union]] with the [[Light of Tabor|Tabor Light]], i.e., Uncreated Divine Light or photomos seen by the apostles in the event of the Transfiguration of Christ and Saint Paul while on the road to [[Damascus]].\n\n==Development of the doctrine==\n{{main article|Hesychast controversy}}\n\nAs an [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monk, Palamas had learned to practice Hesychasm.  Although he had written about Hesychasm, it was not until Barlaam attacked it and Palamas as its chief proponent, that Palamas was driven to defend it in a full exposition which became a central component of Eastern Orthodox theology.  The debate between the Palamites and Barlaamites continued for over a decade and resulted in a series of synods which culminated finally in 1351 when the Palamite doctrine was canonized as Eastern Orthodox dogma.\n\n===Early conflict between Barlaam and Palamas===\n\nAround 1330, [[Barlaam of Seminara]] came to Constantinople from Calabria in southern Italy, where he had grown up as a member of the Greek-speaking community there.  It is disputed whether he was raised as an Orthodox Christian or converted to the Orthodox faith.<ref>9. The Ninth Ecumenical Council of 1341 condemned the Platonic mysticism of Barlaam the Calabrian who had come from the West as a convert to Orthodoxy. Of course the rejection of Platonic type of mysticism was traditional practice for the Fathers. But what the Fathers of this Council were completely shocked at was Barlaam\u2019s claim that God reveals His will by bringing into existence creatures to be seen and heard and which He passes back into non existence after His revelation has been received. One of these supposed creatures was the Angel of The Lord Himself Who appeared to Moses in the burning bush. For the Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils this Angel is the uncreated Logos Himself. This unbelievable nonsense of Barlaam turned out to be that of Augustine himself. (see e.g. his De Trinitate, Books A and B) and of the whole Franco-Latin tradition till today\" ([http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm John S.

Around 1336, Gregory Palamas received copies of treatises written by Barlaam against the Latins, condemning their insertion of the [[Filioque]] into the [[Nicene Creed]].  Although this condemnation was solid Eastern Orthodox theology, Palamas took issue with Barlaam's argument in support of it, since Barlaam declared efforts at demonstrating the nature of God (specifically, the nature of the Holy Spirit) should be abandoned, because God is ultimately unknowable and undemonstrable to humans.  Thus, Barlaam asserted that it was impossible to determine from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds.  According to Sara J. Denning-Bolle, Palamas viewed Barlaam's argument as \"dangerously agnostic\".  In his response titled \"Apodictic Treatises\", Palamas insisted that it was indeed demonstrable that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father but not from the Son.<ref name=Denning-Bolle>{{cite book |title=Dialogue Between an Orthodox and a Barlaamite |author=Saint Gregory Palamas  |publisher=Global Academic Publishing |year=1999 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqljFEGjWJEC&pg=PA3&dq=Pseudo-Dionysius+Palamas&hl=en&ei=qdIbTaTTB4-8sQOI_JDoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Pseudo-Dionysius%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>  A series of letters ensued between the two but they were unable to resolve their differences amicably.\nAccording to J. Konstantinovsky, although both Barlaam and Palamas claimed [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius the Areopagite]] as their authority, their interpretations were radically different.  Barlaam cited Dionysius' ''Mystical Theology'' to support the argument that God is unspeakable and therefore unknowable.  Palamas cited Dionysius as a patristic authority that professed distinctions in God that Barlaam did not acknowledge.<ref>\n\nPapers Presented at the Fourteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies Held in Oxford 2003: . Other Greek writers; John of Damascus and beyond; The West to Hilary p. 318</ref>\n\n===Barlaam's attack on Hesychasm===\n\nSteven Runciman reports that, infuriated by Palamas' attacks against him, Barlaam vowed to humiliate Palamas by attacking the Hesychast teaching for which Palamas had become the chief proponent.  Barlaam visited Thessalonica, where he made the acquaintance of monks who followed the Hesychast teachings.  Runciman describes these monks as ignorant and lacking a real understanding of the Hesychast teaching.  Barlaam issued a number of treatises mocking the absurdity of the practices which he reported included, \"miraculous separations and reunions of the spirit and the soul, of the traffic which demons have with the soul, of the difference between red lights and white lights, of the entry and departure of the intelligence through the nostrils with the breath, of the shields that gather together round the navel, and finally of the union of Our Lord with the soul, which takes place in the full and sensible certitude of the heart within the navel.\"  Barlaam said that the monks had claimed to see the divine essence with bodily eyes, which he viewed as sheer [[Euchites|Messalianism]]. When asked about the light which they saw, the monks told him that it was neither of the superessential Essence nor an angelic essence nor the Spirit itself, but that the spirit contemplated it as another hypostasis.  Barlaam commented snidely, \"I must confess that I do not know what this light is. I only know that it does not exist.\"<ref name=Runciman141>{{cite book |title=The Great Church in captivity: a study of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the eve of the Turkish conquest to the Greek War of Independence |first=Steven |last=Runciman |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm5OGIBgoHMC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Synodicon+of+Orthodoxy+Palamas&source=bl&ots=pdbwRH2vIZ&sig=PhatzkhTuNRoc7FUGEK_1ZT1qPo&hl=en&ei=87kbTfPVG436sAPJp8XnAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Synodicon%20of%20Orthodoxy%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Runciman, Barlaam's attack struck home. He had shown that, in the hands of monks who were inadequately instructed and ignorant of the true Hesychast teaching, the psycho-physical precepts of Hesychasm could produce \"dangerous and ridiculous results\".  To many of the Byzantine intellectuals, Hesychasm appeared \"shockingly anti-intellectual\"  Barlaam nicknamed the Hesychasts \"[[Omphaloskepsis|Omphaloscopoi]]\" (the navel-gazers); the nickname has coloured the tone of most subsequent Western writing about the Byzantine mystics.  However, Barlaam's triumph was short-lived.  Ultimately, the Byzantines had a deep respect for mysticism even if they didn't understand it.  And, in Palamas, Barlaam found an opponent who, in Runciman's opinion,  was more than his equal in knowledge, intellect and expository skills.<ref name=Runciman142>{{cite book |title=The Great Church in captivity: a study of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the eve of the Turkish conquest to the Greek War of Independence |first=Steven |last=Runciman |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm5OGIBgoHMC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Synodicon+of+Orthodoxy+Palamas&source=bl&ots=pdbwRH2vIZ&sig=PhatzkhTuNRoc7FUGEK_1ZT1qPo&hl=en&ei=87kbTfPVG436sAPJp8XnAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Synodicon%20of%20Orthodoxy%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===The First Triad===\n\nIn response to Barlaam's attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled \"Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude\".  The treatises are called \"Triads\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises.\n\nThe Triads were written in three stages.  The first triad was written in the second half of the 1330s and are based on personal discussions between Palamas and Barlaam although Barlaam is never mentioned by name.<ref name=Denning-Bolle/>\n\n===The Hagioritic Tome===\n\nGregory's teaching was affirmed by the superiors and principal monks of Mt. Athos, who met in synod during 1340\u20131.  In early 1341, the monastic communities of Mount Athos wrote the Hagioritic Tome under the supervision and inspiration of Palamas.  Although the Tome does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam's views.  The Tome provides a systematic presentation of Palamas' teaching and became the fundamental textbook for Byzantine mysticism.<ref>{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc |year=1999 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440/page/836 836] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440|url-access=registration |quote=Hagioritic Tome Palamas. }}</ref>\n\nBarlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the Hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice, regarding it as [[Christian heresy|heretical]] and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to [[Tabor Light|the light]] which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]] at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>Parry (1999), p. 231</ref>  Barlaam viewed this doctrine of \"uncreated light\" to be [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. Barlaam accuses the use of the [[Jesus Prayer]] as being a practice of [[Bogomilism]].<ref name=HistoricalTimeline/>\n\n===The Second Triad===\n\nThe second triad quotes some of Barlaam's writings directly.  In response to this second triad, Barlaam composed the treatise \"Against the Messalians\" linking the hesychasts to the [[Messalians]] and thereby accusing them of heresy.  In \"Against the Messalians\", Barlaam attacked Gregory by name for the first time.<ref name=HistoricalOverview>{{cite web|title=Gregory Palamas: An Historical Overview|url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas:_An_Historical_Overview|accessdate=2010-12-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014640/http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas%3A_An_Historical_Overview|archivedate=2011-09-27}}</ref>  Barlaam derisively called the Hesychasts ''omphalopsychoi'' (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of [[Messalianism]], also known as [[Bogomilism]] in the East.<ref name=Denning-Bolle/><ref name=HistoricalTimeline>1.

When Kantakouzenos was deposed in 1354, the anti-Palamists were not able to again prevail over the Palamists as they had in the past.  Martin Jugie attributes this to the fact that, by this time, the patriarchs of Constantinople and the overwhelming majority of the clergy and laity had come to view the cause of Hesychasm as one and the same with that of Orthodoxy.<ref name=Jugie6>{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Jugie|title=The Palamite Controversy|url=http://bekkos.wordpress.com/martin-jugie-the-palamite-controversy/6-palamism-as-official-church-doctrine/|accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>\n\n===Hesychast councils at Constantinople===\n\nIt became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council.  A series of six patriarchal councils, also known as the Hesychast synods, was held in Constantinople on 10 June and August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 and 8 February 1347 and 28 May 1351 to consider the issues.<ref>[http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/63-gregory-palamas-historical-timeline Gregory Palamas: Historical Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607235426/http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/63-gregory-palamas-historical-timeline |date=2012-06-07 }}</ref> Collectively, these councils are accepted as having ecumenical status by some [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christians]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/ourfaith7116.asp |title=Tradition in the Orthodox Church |accessdate=2010-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319180718/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/ourfaith7116.asp |archivedate=2012-03-19 }}</ref> who call them the [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] and the Ninth Ecumenical Council.\n\nThe dispute over Hesychasm came before a synod held at Constantinople in May 1341 and presided over by the emperor [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronicus III]]. The assembly, influenced by the veneration in which the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] were held in the Eastern Church, condemned Barlaam, who [[recant]]ed.<ref name=Denning-Bolle/> Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Roman Catholic Church and was appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Locri-Gerace|Bishop ofGerace]].<ref name=HistoricalOverview/>\n\nAfter Barlaam's departure, [[Gregory Akindynos]] became the chief critic of Palamas.  A second council held in Constantinople in August 1341 condemned Akindynos and affirmed to findings of the earlier council. Akindynos and his supporters gained a brief victory at the third synod held in 1344, which excommunicated Palamas and one of his disciples, [[Patriarch Isidore I of Constantinople|Isidore Buchiras]].<ref name=Fortescue/> Palamas and Buchiras recanted.\n\nIn 1347, however, their protector, John VI Kantakouzenos, entered Constantinople and forced his opponents to crown him co-emperor. In February 1347, a fourth synod was held which deposed the patriarch, [[Patriarch John XIV of Constantinople|John XIV]], and excommunicated Akindynos. Isidore Buchiras, who had been excommunicated by the third synod, was now made patriarch.  In the same month, the Barlaamite party held a competing synod which refused to acknowledge Isidore and excommunicated Palamas.  Akindynos having died in 1348, [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] became the chief opponent of Hesychasm.\n\nSometime between 1344 and 1350, Palamas wrote the ''Capita 150'' (\"One hundred and fifty chapters\"). Robert E. Sinkewicz describes this work as an attempt to \"recapture the larger vision that had become obscured by the minutiae of the debates.\"  Sinkewicz asserts that \"among the polemical works of Palamas, the \"Capita 150\" is comparable only in importance to \"The Triads\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The one hundred and fifty chapters |author=Saint Gregory Palamas |publisher=PIMS |year=1988 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS5LJkFMdOIC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Akindynos+Palamas&source=bl&ots=pO8aVukE26&sig=DcRcK2_IzFZN_iE0TFwh5zDdIhw&hl=en&ei=ChccTY7UIo66sQOCj4DFAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Akindynos%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>\n\nWhen Isidore I died in 1349, the Hesychasts replaced him by one of their monks, [[Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople|Callistus]].\n\nIn May 1351, a patriarchal council conclusively exonerated Palamas and condemned his opponents.<ref name=HistoricalOverview/>  All those who were unwilling to submit to the orthodox view were to be excommunicated and kept under surveillance at their residences.  A series of anathemas were pronounced against Barlaam, Akindynos and their followers; at the same time, a series of acclamations were also declared in favor of Gregory Palamas and the adherents of his doctrine.<ref name=Jugie4>{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Jugie |title=The Palamite Controversy |url=http://bekkos.wordpress.com/martin-jugie-the-palamite-controversy/4-the-triumph-of-palamism-1347-1354/ |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>\n\n===Recognition that Palamas is in Accordance with the Earlier Church Fathers===\n\nAfter the triumph of the Pal\u00e6ologi, the Barlaamite faction convened an anti-Hesychast synod at Ephesus but, by this time, the patriarchs of Constantinople and the overwhelming majority of the clergy and laity had come to view the cause of Hesychasm as one and the same with that of Orthodoxy.  Those who opposed it were accused of Latinizing.  Martin Jugie states that the opposition of the Latins and the Latinophrones, who were necessarily hostile to the doctrine, actually contributed to its adoption, and soon Latinism and Antipalamism became equivalent in the minds of many Orthodox Christians.<ref name=Jugie4/>\n\nHowever, although the Barlaamites could no longer win over the hierarchy of the Eastern Orthodox Church in a synod, neither did they submit immediately to the new doctrine.  Throughout the second half of the fourteenth century, there are numerous reports of Christians returning from the \"Barlaamite heresy\" to Palamite orthodoxy, suggesting that the process of imposing universal acceptance of Palamism spanned several decades.<ref name=Jugie6/>\n\nCallistus I and the ecumenical patriarchs who succeeded him mounted a vigorous campaign to have the new doctrine accepted by the other Eastern patriarchates as well as all the metropolitan sees under their jurisdiction.  However, it took some time to overcome initial resistance to the doctrine.  [[Manuel Kalekas]] reports on this repression as late as 1397.\nExamples of resistance included the metropolitan of Kiev and the patriarch of Antioch; similar acts of resistance were seen in the metropolitan sees that were governed by the Latins as well as in some autonomous ecclesiastical regions, such as the [[Church of Cyprus]].  However, by the end of the fourteenth century, Palamism had become accepted in those locations as well as in all the other Eastern patriarchates.<ref name=Jugie6/>\n\nOne notable example of the campaign to enforce the orthodoxy of the Palamist doctrine was the action taken by patriarch [[Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople|Philotheos I]] to crack down on [[Demetrios Kydones|Demetrios]] and [[Prochorus Cydones|Prochorus]] Cydones.  The two brothers had continued to argue forcefully against Palamism even when brought before the patriarch and enjoined to adhere to the orthodox doctrine.  Finally, in exasperation, Philotheos convened a synod against the two Cydones in April 1368.  However, even this extreme measure failed to effect the submission of Cydones and in the end, Prochorus was excommunicated and suspended from the clergy in perpetuity.  The long tome that was prepared for the synod concludes with a decree canonizing Palamas who had died in 1359.<ref name=Jugie5>{{cite web |first=Martin|last=Jugie|title=The Palamite Controversy|url=http://bekkos.wordpress.com/martin-jugie-the-palamite-controversy/5-the-condemnation-of-prochoros-kydones-1368/|accessdate=2010-12-28}}\nThe reply of Demetrios Cydones  reply to the Hesychasts upon his excommunication under Patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos is considered a classic of Catholic polemic against Hesychasm.</ref>\n\nDespite the initial opposition of the anti-Palamites and some patriarchates and sees, the resistance dwindled away over time and ultimately Palamist doctrine became accepted throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church.  During this period, it became the norm for ecumenical patriarchs to profess the Palamite doctrine upon taking possession of their see.<ref name=Jugie6/>  For theologians who remained in opposition, there was ultimately no choice but to emigrate and convert to the Latin church, a path taken by Kalekas as well as Demetrios Kydones and [[John Kyparissiotes|Ioannes Kypariossiotes]].\n\nAccording to Aristeides Papadakis, \"all (modern) Orthodox scholars who have written on Palamas \u2014 Lossky, Krivosheine, Papamichael, Meyendorff, Christou \u2014 assume his voice to be a legitimate expression of Orthodox tradition.\"<ref name=Papadakis>{{cite book |title=Crisis in Byzantium: The Filioque Controversy in the Patriarchate of Gregory II of Cyprus (1283\u20131289) |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1997 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUBllg0JpgUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Aristeides+Papadakis+%22Crisis+in+Byzantium%22&source=bl&ots=cYaZ2Mnl_I&sig=RktuPCXBkU725Q2kN6VCaGXAcns&hl=en&ei=1CsZTdv5CYrEsAPMnMzfCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==The doctrine==\n{{See also|Feast of Orthodoxy}}\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy, theology is not treated as an academic pursuit; instead, it is based on revelation (see [[gnosiology]]), meaning that Orthodox theology and its theologians are validated by ascetic pursuits, rather than academic degrees (i.e.[[scholasticism]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nJohn Romanides quotes Saint [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] as asserting that one cannot be a genuine or a true theologian or teach knowledge of God without having experienced God, as is defined as the vision of God ([[theoria]]).<ref>Saint Gregory insists that to theologize \"is permitted only to those who have passed examinations and have reached theoria, and who have been previously purified in soul and body, or at least are being purified.\"[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm]</ref> Theoria is obtained according to Eastern Orthodox theology by way of contemplative prayer called hesychasm and is the vision of God as the uncreated light i.e. the [[Tabor light|light of Tabor]].<ref>Theoria: Theoria is the vision of the glory of God.

The three disciples of Christ (Peter, James and John) beheld the glory of Christ on Mount Tabor; they heard at once the voice of the Father: \"this is my beloved Son\" and saw the coming of the Holy Spirit in a cloud \u2013 for, the cloud is the presence of the Holy Spirit, as St. Gregory Palamas says\u2013. Thus the disciples of Christ acquired the knowledge of the Triune God in theoria (vision) and by revelation. It was revealed to them that God is one essence in three hypostases.\n\nThis is what St. Symeon the New Theologian teaches. In his poems he proclaims over and over that while beholding the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. Being in \"theoria\" (vision of God), the Saints do not confuse the hypostatic attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing these hypostatic attributes and teach that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this experience there can be no genuine \"therapeutic tradition\".\n\nAnd indeed we cannot find in all of Latin tradition, the equivalent to Orthodoxy's therapeutic method. The nous is not spoken of; neither is it distinguished from reason. The darkened nous is not treated as a malady and the illumination of the nous as therapy. Many greatly publicized Latin texts are sentimental and exhaust themselves in a barren ethicology. In the Orthodox Church, on the contrary, there is a great tradition concerning these issues which shows that within it there exists the true therapeutic method.\n\nA faith is a true faith inasmuch as it has therapeutic benefits. If it is able to cure, then it is a true faith. If it does not cure, it is not a true faith. The same thing can be said about Medicine: A true scientist is the doctor who knows how to cure and his method has therapeutic benefits, whereas a charlatan is unable to cure. The same holds true where matters of the soul are concerned. The difference between Orthodoxy and the Latin tradition, as well as the Protestant confessions is apparent primarily in the method of therapy. This difference is made manifest in the doctrines of each denomination. Dogmas are not philosophy, neither is theology the same as philosophy.\n\nSince Orthodox spirituality differs distinctly from the \"spiritualities\" of other confessions so much the more does it differ from the \"spirituality\" of Eastern religions, which do not believe in the Theanthropic nature of Christ and the Holy Trinity. They are influenced by the philosophical dialectic, which has been surpassed by the Revelation of God. These traditions are unaware of the notion of personhood and thus the hypostatic principle. And love, as a fundamental teaching is totally absent. One may find, of course, in these Eastern religions an effort to divest themselves of images and rational thoughts, but this is in fact a movement towards nothingness, to non-existence. There is no path leading their \"disciples\" to theosis of the whole man. There are many elements of demonic \"spirituality\" in Eastern religions.\n\nThis is why a vast and chaotic gap exists between Orthodox spirituality and the Eastern religions, in spite of certain external similarities in terminology. For example, Eastern religions may employ terms like ecstasy , dispassion, illumination, noetic energy et.c. but they are impregnated with a content different from corresponding terms in Orthodox spirituality.

The divine energies concern the mutual relations between the Persons of the Trinity (within the divine life) and also God's relation with creatures, to whom they communicate the divine life.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S71LD61qImUC&pg=PA50 |first=Aidan |last=Nichols |title=Light from the East: Authors and Themes in Orthodox Theology'', Part 4 |publisher=Sheed and Ward |year=1995 |pages=50\u201352}}</ref> According to Palamas, God's essence and his energies are differentiated from all eternity, and the distinction between them is not merely a distinction drawn by the human mind.<ref>\"We must distinguish between God's substance or essence, and his energies \u2013 as differentiated realities present in God from all eternity, and not simply by his saving action ''ad extra'', much less as a merely 'formal' distinction, something demanded by the limited operating capacities of human minds\" (Nichols, ''Light from the East'', p. 50).</ref> He maintained the Orthodox doctrine that it remains impossible to know God in His essence (to know who God is in and of Himself), but possible to know God in His energies (to know what God does, and who He is in relation to the creation and to man), as God reveals himself to humanity. In doing so, he made reference to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and other earlier [[Christianity|Christian]] writers and [[Church fathers]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nWhile critics of his teachings argue that this introduces an unacceptable division in the nature of God, Palamas' supporters argue that this distinction was not an innovation but had in fact been introduced in the 4th century writings of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]].  Gregory taught that the [[Essence\u2013energies distinction|energies or operations of God were uncreated]]. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creature even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and convey to the Hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life a true spiritual knowledge of God.

Theosis refers to the attainment of ''likeness to'' or ''union with'' God, as deification has three stages in its process of transformation. Theosis as such is the goal, it is the purpose of life, and it is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between humans' activities and God's uncreated energies (or operations).<ref>[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf THEOSIS as the goal human life by Archimandrite George Abbott]</ref><ref>DEIFICATION AS THE PURPOSE OF MAN'S LIFE By Archimandrite George Abbott of the Holy Monastery of St. Gregorios on Mount Athos [http://www.greekorthodoxchurch.org/theosis_purpose.html]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PeqPAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Thus+salvation+is+conceived+as+the+culmination+of+synergy+between+divine+and+human,+that+is,+the+deification+of+human+beings+by+divine+grace%22&dq=%22Thus+salvation+is+conceived+as+the+culmination+of+synergy+between+divine+and+human,+that+is,+the+deification+of+human+beings+by+divine+grace%22&hl=ro&ei=AgUWTZbbA4XX4gbuqMGGAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA \"Deification in Eastern Orthodox theology\"] {{ISBN|978-0-85364-956-4}}</ref>\n\nTheosis results from leading a pure life, practicing restraint and adhering to the commandments, putting the love of God before all else. This metamorphosis (transfiguration) or transformation results from a deep [[tree of life|love of God]].  ''Theoria'' is achieved by the pure of heart who are no longer subject to the afflictions of the passions.<ref>Saint [[Isaac the Syrian]] says that \"Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained,\" and that \"the tree of life is the love of God\" (Homily 72).</ref>  It is a gift from the Holy Spirit to those who, through observance of the commandments of God and [[asceticism|ascetic practices]] (see [[Praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]], [[kenosis]], [[Poustinia]] and [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Great Schema|schema]]), have achieved dispassion.<ref name=\"CWS65\">Ecstasy comes when, in prayer, the [[nous]] abandons every connection with created things: first \"with everything evil and bad, then with neutral things\" (2,3,35; CWS p. 65). Ecstasy is mainly withdrawal from the opinion of the world and the flesh. With sincere prayer the nous \"abandons all created things\" (2,3,35; CWS p. 65). This ecstasy is higher than abstract theology, that is, than rational theology, and it belongs only to those who have attained dispassion. It is not yet union; the ecstasy which is unceasing prayer of the nous, in which one's nous has continuous remembrance of God and has no relation with the `world of sin', is not yet union with God. This union comes about when the Paraclete \"...illuminates from on high the man who attains in prayer the stage which is superior to the highest natural possibilities and who is awaiting the promise of the Father, and by His revelation ravishes him to the contemplation of the light\" (2,3,35; CWS p. 65). Illumination by God is what shows His union with man. (GK: ''[[Apatheia|apathea]]'') and clarity of vision. Vision here refers to the vision of the''nous'' that has been purified by ascetic practice.\n\nOrthodox Psychotherapy Section The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas by Metropolitan [[Hierotheos Vlachos]] published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery,Greece (January 1, 2005) {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}</ref> According to the standard ascetic formulation of this process, there are three stages: ''katharsis'' or [[purgative way|purification]], ''theoria'' or [[illuminative way|illumination]], and ''theosis'' or deification (also referred to as [[unitive way|union with God]]).<ref name=\"purification for love\">Proper preparation for vision of God takes place in two stages: purification, and illumination of the noetic faculty. Without this it is impossible for man's selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision, in this case vision ''by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God''. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God's love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God's glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness. From FRANKS, ROMANS, FEUDALISM, AND DOCTRINE/Diagnosis and Therapy Father [[John S.

''Theosis'' is obtained by engaging in [[hesychasm|contemplative prayer]] resulting from the cultivation of watchfulness (Gk:''[[nepsis]]''). In its purest form, ''theoria'' is considered as the 'beholding', 'seeing' or 'vision' of God.<ref>\"The contemplative mind sees God, in so far as this is possible for man\"; ''What Is prayer?'' by [[Theophan the Recluse]] cited in ''The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology'',p. 73, compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, trans, E. Kadloubovsky and E.M. Palmer, ed. Timothy Ware, 1966, Faber & Faber, London.</ref>\n\nFollowing Christ's instruction to \"go into your room or closet and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret\" (Matthew 6:6), the [[hesychast]] withdraws into solitude in order that he or she may enter into a deeper state of contemplative stillness. By means of this stillness, the mind is calmed, and the ability to see reality is enhanced. The practitioner seeks to attain what the [[Paul the Apostle|apostle Paul]] called 'unceasing prayer'.\n\nPalamas synthesized the different traditions of theoria into an understanding of theoria that, through baptism, one receives the Holy Spirit. Through participation in the sacraments of the Church and the performance of works of faith, one cultivates a relationship with God. If one then, through willful submission to God, is devotional and becomes humble, akin to the [[Theotokos]] and the saints, and proceeds in faith past the point of rational contemplation, one can experience God. Palamas stated that this is not a mechanized process because each person is unique, but that the [[apodictic]] way that one experiences the uncreated light, or God, is through contemplative prayer called [[hesychasm]]. Theoria is cultivated through each of the steps of the growing process of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]].\n\nThe only true way to experience Christ, according to Palamas, was the [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith. Once a person discovers Christ (through the Orthodox church), they begin the process of theosis, which is the gradual submission to the Truth (i.e. God) in order to be deified ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). Theoria is seen to be the experience of God [[hypostasis (religion)|hypostatically]] in person. However, since the [[ousia|essence]] of God is unknowable, it also cannot be experienced. Palamas expressed theoria as an experience of God as it happens to the whole person (soul or [[nous]]), not just the mind or body, in contrast to an experience of God that is drawn from memory, the mind, or in time.<ref name=autogenerated1>V Lossky Vision of God pg 162\u2013163</ref><ref>The vision of the uncreated light, which offers knowledge of God to man, is sensory and supra-sensory.

In opposition to this teaching, Barlaam held that they were ''created'' effects, because no part of God whatsoever could be directly perceived by humans. The Orthodox interpreted his position as denying the renewing power of the [[Holy Spirit]], which, in the words of various Orthodox hymns, \"made [[apostles]] out of fishermen\" (i.e., makes saints even out of uneducated people). In his anti-hesychastic works Barlaam held that knowledge of worldly wisdom was necessary for the perfection of the monks and denied the possibility of the vision of the divine life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nPalamas taught that the truth is a person, Jesus Christ, a form of objective reality. In order for a Christian to be authentic, he or she must experience the Truth (i.e. Christ) as a real person (see [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]).  Gregory further asserted that when [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] witnessed the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on Mount Tabor, that they were in fact seeing the uncreated light of God; and that it is possible for others to be granted to see that same uncreated light of God with the help of certain spiritual disciplines and contemplative [[prayer]], although not in any automatic or mechanistic fashion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nSt. Maximus, whose teaching is cited by St, Gregory, says that the Apostles saw the uncreated Light <ref>\"by a transformation of the activity of their senses, produced in them by the Spirit\" (2.3.22).

Western theology is based on rational thought whereas Orthodoxy is hesychastic. Scholastic theology tried to understand logically the Revelation of God and conform to philosophical methodology. Characteristic of such an approach is the saying of Anselm of Canterbury: \"I believe so as to understand\". The Scholastics acknowledged God at the outset and then endeavoured to prove His existence by logical arguments and rational categories. In the Orthodox Church, as expressed by the Holy Fathers, faith is God revealing Himself to man. We accept faith by hearing it not so that we can understand it rationally, but so that we can cleanse our hearts, attain to faith by \"theoria\" and experience the Revelation of God.

He further characterized the Eastern canonization of Palamas's teachings as a \"resurrection of polytheism\".<ref name=Vailhe2>\"Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies.

Andreas Andreopoulos cites the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia article by Fortescue as an example of how Barlaam's distrustful and hostile attitude regarding hesychasm survived until recently in the West, adding that now \"the Western world has started to rediscover what amounts to a lost tradition.

Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies. He was declared the 'holy doctor' and 'one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church', and his writings were proclaimed 'the infallible guide of the Christian Faith'.

It is to focus one's mind on God and pray to God unceasingly.\n\nUnder church tradition the practice of Hesychasm has it beginnings in the bible, Matthew 6:6 and the [[Philokalia]]. The tradition of contemplation with inner silence or tranquility is shared by all Eastern [[ascetics|asceticism]] having its roots in the Egyptian traditions of monasticism exemplified by such Orthodox monastics as [[Anthony the Great|St Anthony of Egypt]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, Gregory Sinaita learned hesychasm from Arsenius of Crete and spread the doctrine, bringing it to the monks on [[Mount Athos]].<ref name=Vailhe/>  The terms ''Hesychasm'' and ''Hesychast'' were used by the monks on [[Mount Athos]] to refer to the practice and to the practitioner of a method of mental ascesis that involves the use of the Jesus Prayer assisted by certain psychophysical techniques.  The hesychasts stated that at higher stages of their prayer practice they reached the actual [[theoria|contemplation-union]] with the [[Light of Tabor|Tabor Light]], i.e., Uncreated Divine Light or photomos seen by the apostles in the event of the Transfiguration of Christ and Saint Paul while on the road to [[Damascus]].\n\n==Development of the doctrine==\n{{main article|Hesychast controversy}}\n\nAs an [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monk, Palamas had learned to practice Hesychasm.  Although he had written about Hesychasm, it was not until Barlaam attacked it and Palamas as its chief proponent, that Palamas was driven to defend it in a full exposition which became a central component of Eastern Orthodox theology.  The debate between the Palamites and Barlaamites continued for over a decade and resulted in a series of synods which culminated finally in 1351 when the Palamite doctrine was canonized as Eastern Orthodox dogma.\n\n===Early conflict between Barlaam and Palamas===\n\nAround 1330, [[Barlaam of Seminara]] came to Constantinople from Calabria in southern Italy, where he had grown up as a member of the Greek-speaking community there.  It is disputed whether he was raised as an Orthodox Christian or converted to the Orthodox faith.<ref>9. The Ninth Ecumenical Council of 1341 condemned the Platonic mysticism of Barlaam the Calabrian who had come from the West as a convert to Orthodoxy. Of course the rejection of Platonic type of mysticism was traditional practice for the Fathers. But what the Fathers of this Council were completely shocked at was Barlaam\u2019s claim that God reveals His will by bringing into existence creatures to be seen and heard and which He passes back into non existence after His revelation has been received. One of these supposed creatures was the Angel of The Lord Himself Who appeared to Moses in the burning bush. For the Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils this Angel is the uncreated Logos Himself. This unbelievable nonsense of Barlaam turned out to be that of Augustine himself. (see e.g. his De Trinitate, Books A and B) and of the whole Franco-Latin tradition till today\" ([http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm John S.

Around 1336, Gregory Palamas received copies of treatises written by Barlaam against the Latins, condemning their insertion of the [[Filioque]] into the [[Nicene Creed]].  Although this condemnation was solid Eastern Orthodox theology, Palamas took issue with Barlaam's argument in support of it, since Barlaam declared efforts at demonstrating the nature of God (specifically, the nature of the Holy Spirit) should be abandoned, because God is ultimately unknowable and undemonstrable to humans.  Thus, Barlaam asserted that it was impossible to determine from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds.  According to Sara J. Denning-Bolle, Palamas viewed Barlaam's argument as \"dangerously agnostic\".  In his response titled \"Apodictic Treatises\", Palamas insisted that it was indeed demonstrable that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father but not from the Son.<ref name=Denning-Bolle>{{cite book |title=Dialogue Between an Orthodox and a Barlaamite |author=Saint Gregory Palamas  |publisher=Global Academic Publishing |year=1999 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqljFEGjWJEC&pg=PA3&dq=Pseudo-Dionysius+Palamas&hl=en&ei=qdIbTaTTB4-8sQOI_JDoCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Pseudo-Dionysius%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>  A series of letters ensued between the two but they were unable to resolve their differences amicably.\nAccording to J. Konstantinovsky, although both Barlaam and Palamas claimed [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius the Areopagite]] as their authority, their interpretations were radically different.  Barlaam cited Dionysius' ''Mystical Theology'' to support the argument that God is unspeakable and therefore unknowable.  Palamas cited Dionysius as a patristic authority that professed distinctions in God that Barlaam did not acknowledge.<ref>\n\nPapers Presented at the Fourteenth International Conference on Patristic Studies Held in Oxford 2003: .

Barlaam visited Thessalonica, where he made the acquaintance of monks who followed the Hesychast teachings.  Runciman describes these monks as ignorant and lacking a real understanding of the Hesychast teaching.  Barlaam issued a number of treatises mocking the absurdity of the practices which he reported included, \"miraculous separations and reunions of the spirit and the soul, of the traffic which demons have with the soul, of the difference between red lights and white lights, of the entry and departure of the intelligence through the nostrils with the breath, of the shields that gather together round the navel, and finally of the union of Our Lord with the soul, which takes place in the full and sensible certitude of the heart within the navel.\"  Barlaam said that the monks had claimed to see the divine essence with bodily eyes, which he viewed as sheer [[Euchites|Messalianism]]. When asked about the light which they saw, the monks told him that it was neither of the superessential Essence nor an angelic essence nor the Spirit itself, but that the spirit contemplated it as another hypostasis.  Barlaam commented snidely, \"I must confess that I do not know what this light is. I only know that it does not exist.\"<ref name=Runciman141>{{cite book |title=The Great Church in captivity: a study of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the eve of the Turkish conquest to the Greek War of Independence |first=Steven |last=Runciman |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm5OGIBgoHMC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Synodicon+of+Orthodoxy+Palamas&source=bl&ots=pdbwRH2vIZ&sig=PhatzkhTuNRoc7FUGEK_1ZT1qPo&hl=en&ei=87kbTfPVG436sAPJp8XnAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Synodicon%20of%20Orthodoxy%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Runciman, Barlaam's attack struck home. He had shown that, in the hands of monks who were inadequately instructed and ignorant of the true Hesychast teaching, the psycho-physical precepts of Hesychasm could produce \"dangerous and ridiculous results\".  To many of the Byzantine intellectuals, Hesychasm appeared \"shockingly anti-intellectual\"  Barlaam nicknamed the Hesychasts \"[[Omphaloskepsis|Omphaloscopoi]]\" (the navel-gazers); the nickname has coloured the tone of most subsequent Western writing about the Byzantine mystics.  However, Barlaam's triumph was short-lived.  Ultimately, the Byzantines had a deep respect for mysticism even if they didn't understand it.  And, in Palamas, Barlaam found an opponent who, in Runciman's opinion,  was more than his equal in knowledge, intellect and expository skills.<ref name=Runciman142>{{cite book |title=The Great Church in captivity: a study of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the eve of the Turkish conquest to the Greek War of Independence |first=Steven |last=Runciman |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm5OGIBgoHMC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Synodicon+of+Orthodoxy+Palamas&source=bl&ots=pdbwRH2vIZ&sig=PhatzkhTuNRoc7FUGEK_1ZT1qPo&hl=en&ei=87kbTfPVG436sAPJp8XnAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Synodicon%20of%20Orthodoxy%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===The First Triad===\n\nIn response to Barlaam's attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled \"Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude\".  The treatises are called \"Triads\" because they were organized as three sets of three treatises.\n\nThe Triads were written in three stages.  The first triad was written in the second half of the 1330s and are based on personal discussions between Palamas and Barlaam although Barlaam is never mentioned by name.<ref name=Denning-Bolle/>\n\n===The Hagioritic Tome===\n\nGregory's teaching was affirmed by the superiors and principal monks of Mt. Athos, who met in synod during 1340\u20131.  In early 1341, the monastic communities of Mount Athos wrote the Hagioritic Tome under the supervision and inspiration of Palamas.  Although the Tome does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam's views.  The Tome provides a systematic presentation of Palamas' teaching and became the fundamental textbook for Byzantine mysticism.<ref>{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc |year=1999 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440/page/836 836] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440|url-access=registration |quote=Hagioritic Tome Palamas. }}</ref>\n\nBarlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the Hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice, regarding it as [[Christian heresy|heretical]] and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to [[Tabor Light|the light]] which had been manifested to Jesus' disciples on [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]] at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].<ref>Parry (1999), p. 231</ref>  Barlaam viewed this doctrine of \"uncreated light\" to be [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God.

In response to this second triad, Barlaam composed the treatise \"Against the Messalians\" linking the hesychasts to the [[Messalians]] and thereby accusing them of heresy.

When Kantakouzenos was deposed in 1354, the anti-Palamists were not able to again prevail over the Palamists as they had in the past.  Martin Jugie attributes this to the fact that, by this time, the patriarchs of Constantinople and the overwhelming majority of the clergy and laity had come to view the cause of Hesychasm as one and the same with that of Orthodoxy.<ref name=Jugie6>{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Jugie|title=The Palamite Controversy|url=http://bekkos.wordpress.com/martin-jugie-the-palamite-controversy/6-palamism-as-official-church-doctrine/|accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>\n\n===Hesychast councils at Constantinople===\n\nIt became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council.  A series of six patriarchal councils, also known as the Hesychast synods, was held in Constantinople on 10 June and August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 and 8 February 1347 and 28 May 1351 to consider the issues.<ref>[http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/63-gregory-palamas-historical-timeline Gregory Palamas: Historical Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607235426/http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/63-gregory-palamas-historical-timeline |date=2012-06-07 }}</ref> Collectively, these councils are accepted as having ecumenical status by some [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christians]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/ourfaith7116.asp |title=Tradition in the Orthodox Church |accessdate=2010-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319180718/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/ourfaith7116.asp |archivedate=2012-03-19 }}</ref> who call them the [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] and the Ninth Ecumenical Council.\n\nThe dispute over Hesychasm came before a synod held at Constantinople in May 1341 and presided over by the emperor [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronicus III]]. The assembly, influenced by the veneration in which the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] were held in the Eastern Church, condemned Barlaam, who [[recant]]ed.<ref name=Denning-Bolle/> Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Roman Catholic Church and was appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Locri-Gerace|Bishop ofGerace]].<ref name=HistoricalOverview/>\n\nAfter Barlaam's departure, [[Gregory Akindynos]] became the chief critic of Palamas.  A second council held in Constantinople in August 1341 condemned Akindynos and affirmed to findings of the earlier council. Akindynos and his supporters gained a brief victory at the third synod held in 1344, which excommunicated Palamas and one of his disciples, [[Patriarch Isidore I of Constantinople|Isidore Buchiras]].<ref name=Fortescue/> Palamas and Buchiras recanted.\n\nIn 1347, however, their protector, John VI Kantakouzenos, entered Constantinople and forced his opponents to crown him co-emperor. In February 1347, a fourth synod was held which deposed the patriarch, [[Patriarch John XIV of Constantinople|John XIV]], and excommunicated Akindynos. Isidore Buchiras, who had been excommunicated by the third synod, was now made patriarch.  In the same month, the Barlaamite party held a competing synod which refused to acknowledge Isidore and excommunicated Palamas.  Akindynos having died in 1348, [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] became the chief opponent of Hesychasm.\n\nSometime between 1344 and 1350, Palamas wrote the ''Capita 150'' (\"One hundred and fifty chapters\"). Robert E. Sinkewicz describes this work as an attempt to \"recapture the larger vision that had become obscured by the minutiae of the debates.\"  Sinkewicz asserts that \"among the polemical works of Palamas, the \"Capita 150\" is comparable only in importance to \"The Triads\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The one hundred and fifty chapters |author=Saint Gregory Palamas |publisher=PIMS |year=1988 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS5LJkFMdOIC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Akindynos+Palamas&source=bl&ots=pO8aVukE26&sig=DcRcK2_IzFZN_iE0TFwh5zDdIhw&hl=en&ei=ChccTY7UIo66sQOCj4DFAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Akindynos%20Palamas&f=false}}</ref>\n\nWhen Isidore I died in 1349, the Hesychasts replaced him by one of their monks, [[Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople|Callistus]].\n\nIn May 1351, a patriarchal council conclusively exonerated Palamas and condemned his opponents.<ref name=HistoricalOverview/>  All those who were unwilling to submit to the orthodox view were to be excommunicated and kept under surveillance at their residences.  A series of anathemas were pronounced against Barlaam, Akindynos and their followers; at the same time, a series of acclamations were also declared in favor of Gregory Palamas and the adherents of his doctrine.<ref name=Jugie4>{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Jugie |title=The Palamite Controversy |url=http://bekkos.wordpress.com/martin-jugie-the-palamite-controversy/4-the-triumph-of-palamism-1347-1354/ |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>\n\n===Recognition that Palamas is in Accordance with the Earlier Church Fathers===\n\nAfter the triumph of the Pal\u00e6ologi, the Barlaamite faction convened an anti-Hesychast synod at Ephesus but, by this time, the patriarchs of Constantinople and the overwhelming majority of the clergy and laity had come to view the cause of Hesychasm as one and the same with that of Orthodoxy.  Those who opposed it were accused of Latinizing.  Martin Jugie states that the opposition of the Latins and the Latinophrones, who were necessarily hostile to the doctrine, actually contributed to its adoption, and soon Latinism and Antipalamism became equivalent in the minds of many Orthodox Christians.<ref name=Jugie4/>\n\nHowever, although the Barlaamites could no longer win over the hierarchy of the Eastern Orthodox Church in a synod, neither did they submit immediately to the new doctrine.  Throughout the second half of the fourteenth century, there are numerous reports of Christians returning from the \"Barlaamite heresy\" to Palamite orthodoxy, suggesting that the process of imposing universal acceptance of Palamism spanned several decades.<ref name=Jugie6/>\n\nCallistus I and the ecumenical patriarchs who succeeded him mounted a vigorous campaign to have the new doctrine accepted by the other Eastern patriarchates as well as all the metropolitan sees under their jurisdiction.  However, it took some time to overcome initial resistance to the doctrine.  [[Manuel Kalekas]] reports on this repression as late as 1397.\nExamples of resistance included the metropolitan of Kiev and the patriarch of Antioch; similar acts of resistance were seen in the metropolitan sees that were governed by the Latins as well as in some autonomous ecclesiastical regions, such as the [[Church of Cyprus]].  However, by the end of the fourteenth century, Palamism had become accepted in those locations as well as in all the other Eastern patriarchates.<ref name=Jugie6/>\n\nOne notable example of the campaign to enforce the orthodoxy of the Palamist doctrine was the action taken by patriarch [[Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople|Philotheos I]] to crack down on [[Demetrios Kydones|Demetrios]] and [[Prochorus Cydones|Prochorus]] Cydones.  The two brothers had continued to argue forcefully against Palamism even when brought before the patriarch and enjoined to adhere to the orthodox doctrine.  Finally, in exasperation, Philotheos convened a synod against the two Cydones in April 1368.  However, even this extreme measure failed to effect the submission of Cydones and in the end, Prochorus was excommunicated and suspended from the clergy in perpetuity.  The long tome that was prepared for the synod concludes with a decree canonizing Palamas who had died in 1359.<ref name=Jugie5>{{cite web |first=Martin|last=Jugie|title=The Palamite Controversy|url=http://bekkos.wordpress.com/martin-jugie-the-palamite-controversy/5-the-condemnation-of-prochoros-kydones-1368/|accessdate=2010-12-28}}\nThe reply of Demetrios Cydones  reply to the Hesychasts upon his excommunication under Patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos is considered a classic of Catholic polemic against Hesychasm.</ref>\n\nDespite the initial opposition of the anti-Palamites and some patriarchates and sees, the resistance dwindled away over time and ultimately Palamist doctrine became accepted throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church.  During this period, it became the norm for ecumenical patriarchs to profess the Palamite doctrine upon taking possession of their see.<ref name=Jugie6/>  For theologians who remained in opposition, there was ultimately no choice but to emigrate and convert to the Latin church, a path taken by Kalekas as well as Demetrios Kydones and [[John Kyparissiotes|Ioannes Kypariossiotes]].\n\nAccording to Aristeides Papadakis, \"all (modern) Orthodox scholars who have written on Palamas \u2014 Lossky, Krivosheine, Papamichael, Meyendorff, Christou \u2014 assume his voice to be a legitimate expression of Orthodox tradition.\"<ref name=Papadakis>{{cite book |title=Crisis in Byzantium: The Filioque Controversy in the Patriarchate of Gregory II of Cyprus (1283\u20131289) |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1997 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUBllg0JpgUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Aristeides+Papadakis+%22Crisis+in+Byzantium%22&source=bl&ots=cYaZ2Mnl_I&sig=RktuPCXBkU725Q2kN6VCaGXAcns&hl=en&ei=1CsZTdv5CYrEsAPMnMzfCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==The doctrine==\n{{See also|Feast of Orthodoxy}}\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy, theology is not treated as an academic pursuit; instead, it is based on revelation (see [[gnosiology]]), meaning that Orthodox theology and its theologians are validated by ascetic pursuits, rather than academic degrees (i.e.[[scholasticism]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nJohn Romanides quotes Saint [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] as asserting that one cannot be a genuine or a true theologian or teach knowledge of God without having experienced God, as is defined as the vision of God ([[theoria]]).<ref>Saint Gregory insists that to theologize \"is permitted only to those who have passed examinations and have reached theoria, and who have been previously purified in soul and body, or at least are being purified.\"[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm]</ref> Theoria is obtained according to Eastern Orthodox theology by way of contemplative prayer called hesychasm and is the vision of God as the uncreated light i.e. the [[Tabor light|light of Tabor]].<ref>Theoria: Theoria is the vision of the glory of God.

Thus, theoria, vision and theosis are closely connected. Theoria has various degrees. There is illumination, vision of God, and constant vision (for hours, days, weeks, even months). Noetic prayer is the first stage of theoria. Theoretical man is one who is at this stage. In Patristic theology, the theoretical man is characterized as the shepherd of the sheep.

The three disciples of Christ (Peter, James and John) beheld the glory of Christ on Mount Tabor; they heard at once the voice of the Father: \"this is my beloved Son\" and saw the coming of the Holy Spirit in a cloud \u2013 for, the cloud is the presence of the Holy Spirit, as St. Gregory Palamas says\u2013. Thus the disciples of Christ acquired the knowledge of the Triune God in theoria (vision) and by revelation. It was revealed to them that God is one essence in three hypostases.\n\nThis is what St. Symeon the New Theologian teaches. In his poems he proclaims over and over that while beholding the uncreated Light, the deified man acquires the Revelation of God the Trinity. Being in \"theoria\" (vision of God), the Saints do not confuse the hypostatic attributes. The fact that the Latin tradition came to the point of confusing these hypostatic attributes and teach that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son also, shows the non-existence of empirical theology for them. Latin tradition speaks also of created grace, a fact which suggests that there is no experience of the grace of God. For, when man obtains the experience of God, then he comes to understand well that this grace is uncreated. Without this experience there can be no genuine \"therapeutic tradition\".\n\nAnd indeed we cannot find in all of Latin tradition, the equivalent to Orthodoxy's therapeutic method. The nous is not spoken of; neither is it distinguished from reason. The darkened nous is not treated as a malady and the illumination of the nous as therapy. Many greatly publicized Latin texts are sentimental and exhaust themselves in a barren ethicology. In the Orthodox Church, on the contrary, there is a great tradition concerning these issues which shows that within it there exists the true therapeutic method.\n\nA faith is a true faith inasmuch as it has therapeutic benefits. If it is able to cure, then it is a true faith. If it does not cure, it is not a true faith. The same thing can be said about Medicine: A true scientist is the doctor who knows how to cure and his method has therapeutic benefits, whereas a charlatan is unable to cure. The same holds true where matters of the soul are concerned. The difference between Orthodoxy and the Latin tradition, as well as the Protestant confessions is apparent primarily in the method of therapy. This difference is made manifest in the doctrines of each denomination. Dogmas are not philosophy, neither is theology the same as philosophy.\n\nSince Orthodox spirituality differs distinctly from the \"spiritualities\" of other confessions so much the more does it differ from the \"spirituality\" of Eastern religions, which do not believe in the Theanthropic nature of Christ and the Holy Trinity. They are influenced by the philosophical dialectic, which has been surpassed by the Revelation of God. These traditions are unaware of the notion of personhood and thus the hypostatic principle. And love, as a fundamental teaching is totally absent. One may find, of course, in these Eastern religions an effort to divest themselves of images and rational thoughts, but this is in fact a movement towards nothingness, to non-existence. There is no path leading their \"disciples\" to theosis of the whole man. There are many elements of demonic \"spirituality\" in Eastern religions.\n\nThis is why a vast and chaotic gap exists between Orthodox spirituality and the Eastern religions, in spite of certain external similarities in terminology. For example, Eastern religions may employ terms like ecstasy , dispassion, illumination, noetic energy et.c. but they are impregnated with a content different from corresponding terms in Orthodox spirituality.

The divine energies concern the mutual relations between the Persons of the Trinity (within the divine life) and also God's relation with creatures, to whom they communicate the divine life.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S71LD61qImUC&pg=PA50 |first=Aidan |last=Nichols |title=Light from the East: Authors and Themes in Orthodox Theology'', Part 4 |publisher=Sheed and Ward |year=1995 |pages=50\u201352}}</ref> According to Palamas, God's essence and his energies are differentiated from all eternity, and the distinction between them is not merely a distinction drawn by the human mind.<ref>\"We must distinguish between God's substance or essence, and his energies \u2013 as differentiated realities present in God from all eternity, and not simply by his saving action ''ad extra'', much less as a merely 'formal' distinction, something demanded by the limited operating capacities of human minds\" (Nichols, ''Light from the East'', p. 50).</ref> He maintained the Orthodox doctrine that it remains impossible to know God in His essence (to know who God is in and of Himself), but possible to know God in His energies (to know what God does, and who He is in relation to the creation and to man), as God reveals himself to humanity. In doing so, he made reference to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and other earlier [[Christianity|Christian]] writers and [[Church fathers]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nWhile critics of his teachings argue that this introduces an unacceptable division in the nature of God, Palamas' supporters argue that this distinction was not an innovation but had in fact been introduced in the 4th century writings of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]].  Gregory taught that the [[Essence\u2013energies distinction|energies or operations of God were uncreated]]. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creature even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and convey to the Hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life a true spiritual knowledge of God. In Palamite theology, it is the uncreated energies of God that illumine the Hesychast who has been vouchsafed an experience of the Uncreated Light.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nHistorically, Western Christianity has tended to reject the essence\u2013energies distinction, characterizing it as a heretical introduction of an unacceptable division in the Trinity and suggestive of polytheism.<ref name=Meyendorff>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&pg=PR11&dq=Palamas+Meyendorff+Nicene+doctrine&hl=en&ei=4iQXTf_BE4SWhQfI5qi3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false John Meyendorff (editor),''Gregory Palamas \u2013 The Triads'', p. xi]</ref><ref name=Vailhe/> Further, the associated practice of hesychasm used to achieve [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] was characterized as \"magic\".<ref name=Fortescue/> Eastern Orthodox theologians have criticized Western theology, and its traditional theory that God is [[actus purus|pure actuality]] in particular, for its alleged incompatibility with the essence\u2013energies distinction.<ref>\"the West confuses God's essence with his energy, regarding the energy as a property of the divine essence and interpreting the latter as \"pure energy\" (actus purus)\" (Christos Yannaras, ''Orthodoxy and the West:\nHellenic Self-Identity in the Modern Age'', Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2006), p. 36.</ref><ref>\"This distinction is contrary to the Western confusion of the uncreated essence with the uncreated energies and this is by the claim that God is Actus Purus\" (George C.

Theosis refers to the attainment of ''likeness to'' or ''union with'' God, as deification has three stages in its process of transformation. Theosis as such is the goal, it is the purpose of life, and it is considered achievable only through a synergy (or cooperation) between humans' activities and God's uncreated energies (or operations).<ref>[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf THEOSIS as the goal human life by Archimandrite George Abbott]</ref><ref>DEIFICATION AS THE PURPOSE OF MAN'S LIFE By Archimandrite George Abbott of the Holy Monastery of St. Gregorios on Mount Athos [http://www.greekorthodoxchurch.org/theosis_purpose.html]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PeqPAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Thus+salvation+is+conceived+as+the+culmination+of+synergy+between+divine+and+human,+that+is,+the+deification+of+human+beings+by+divine+grace%22&dq=%22Thus+salvation+is+conceived+as+the+culmination+of+synergy+between+divine+and+human,+that+is,+the+deification+of+human+beings+by+divine+grace%22&hl=ro&ei=AgUWTZbbA4XX4gbuqMGGAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA \"Deification in Eastern Orthodox theology\"] {{ISBN|978-0-85364-956-4}}</ref>\n\nTheosis results from leading a pure life, practicing restraint and adhering to the commandments, putting the love of God before all else. This metamorphosis (transfiguration) or transformation results from a deep [[tree of life|love of God]].  ''Theoria'' is achieved by the pure of heart who are no longer subject to the afflictions of the passions.<ref>Saint [[Isaac the Syrian]] says that \"Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained,\" and that \"the tree of life is the love of God\" (Homily 72).</ref>  It is a gift from the Holy Spirit to those who, through observance of the commandments of God and [[asceticism|ascetic practices]] (see [[Praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]], [[kenosis]], [[Poustinia]] and [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism#Great Schema|schema]]), have achieved dispassion.<ref name=\"CWS65\">Ecstasy comes when, in prayer, the [[nous]] abandons every connection with created things: first \"with everything evil and bad, then with neutral things\" (2,3,35; CWS p. 65). Ecstasy is mainly withdrawal from the opinion of the world and the flesh. With sincere prayer the nous \"abandons all created things\" (2,3,35; CWS p. 65). This ecstasy is higher than abstract theology, that is, than rational theology, and it belongs only to those who have attained dispassion. It is not yet union; the ecstasy which is unceasing prayer of the nous, in which one's nous has continuous remembrance of God and has no relation with the `world of sin', is not yet union with God. This union comes about when the Paraclete \"...illuminates from on high the man who attains in prayer the stage which is superior to the highest natural possibilities and who is awaiting the promise of the Father, and by His revelation ravishes him to the contemplation of the light\" (2,3,35; CWS p. 65). Illumination by God is what shows His union with man. (GK: ''[[Apatheia|apathea]]'') and clarity of vision. Vision here refers to the vision of the''nous'' that has been purified by ascetic practice.\n\nOrthodox Psychotherapy Section The Knowledge of God according to St. Gregory Palamas by Metropolitan [[Hierotheos Vlachos]] published by Birth of Theotokos Monastery,Greece (January 1, 2005) {{ISBN|978-960-7070-27-2}}</ref> According to the standard ascetic formulation of this process, there are three stages: ''katharsis'' or [[purgative way|purification]], ''theoria'' or [[illuminative way|illumination]], and ''theosis'' or deification (also referred to as [[unitive way|union with God]]).<ref name=\"purification for love\">Proper preparation for vision of God takes place in two stages: purification, and illumination of the noetic faculty. Without this it is impossible for man's selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision, in this case vision ''by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God''. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God's love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God's glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness. From FRANKS, ROMANS, FEUDALISM, AND DOCTRINE/Diagnosis and Therapy Father [[John S.

According to Palamism, the divine essence remains transcendent and inaccessible, even after the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] and the sending of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref>Michael J. Christensen, Jeffery A. Wittung (editors), ''Partakers of the Divine Nature''(Associated University Presses 2007 {{ISBN|0-8386-4111-3}}), p. 234</ref> Theosis is possible because of God's energies, \"through which God becomes known to us and makes us share in the divine life\".<ref name=collins/>\n\n===Theoria===\n{{main article|Theoria}}\n\nIn [[Eastern Orthodox]] theology, ''theoria'' refers to a stage of illumination on the path to ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'', in which one beholds God. ''Theosis'' is obtained by engaging in [[hesychasm|contemplative prayer]] resulting from the cultivation of watchfulness (Gk:''[[nepsis]]''). In its purest form, ''theoria'' is considered as the 'beholding', 'seeing' or 'vision' of God.<ref>\"The contemplative mind sees God, in so far as this is possible for man\"; ''What Is prayer?'' by [[Theophan the Recluse]] cited in ''The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology'',p. 73, compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, trans, E. Kadloubovsky and E.M. Palmer, ed. Timothy Ware, 1966, Faber & Faber, London.</ref>\n\nFollowing Christ's instruction to \"go into your room or closet and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret\" (Matthew 6:6), the [[hesychast]] withdraws into solitude in order that he or she may enter into a deeper state of contemplative stillness. By means of this stillness, the mind is calmed, and the ability to see reality is enhanced. The practitioner seeks to attain what the [[Paul the Apostle|apostle Paul]] called 'unceasing prayer'.\n\nPalamas synthesized the different traditions of theoria into an understanding of theoria that, through baptism, one receives the Holy Spirit. Through participation in the sacraments of the Church and the performance of works of faith, one cultivates a relationship with God. If one then, through willful submission to God, is devotional and becomes humble, akin to the [[Theotokos]] and the saints, and proceeds in faith past the point of rational contemplation, one can experience God. Palamas stated that this is not a mechanized process because each person is unique, but that the [[apodictic]] way that one experiences the uncreated light, or God, is through contemplative prayer called [[hesychasm]]. Theoria is cultivated through each of the steps of the growing process of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]].\n\nThe only true way to experience Christ, according to Palamas, was the [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith. Once a person discovers Christ (through the Orthodox church), they begin the process of theosis, which is the gradual submission to the Truth (i.e. God) in order to be deified ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). Theoria is seen to be the experience of God [[hypostasis (religion)|hypostatically]] in person. However, since the [[ousia|essence]] of God is unknowable, it also cannot be experienced.

In opposition to this teaching, Barlaam held that they were ''created'' effects, because no part of God whatsoever could be directly perceived by humans. The Orthodox interpreted his position as denying the renewing power of the [[Holy Spirit]], which, in the words of various Orthodox hymns, \"made [[apostles]] out of fishermen\" (i.e., makes saints even out of uneducated people). In his anti-hesychastic works Barlaam held that knowledge of worldly wisdom was necessary for the perfection of the monks and denied the possibility of the vision of the divine life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nPalamas taught that the truth is a person, Jesus Christ, a form of objective reality. In order for a Christian to be authentic, he or she must experience the Truth (i.e. Christ) as a real person (see [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]).  Gregory further asserted that when [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] witnessed the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on Mount Tabor, that they were in fact seeing the uncreated light of God; and that it is possible for others to be granted to see that same uncreated light of God with the help of certain spiritual disciplines and contemplative [[prayer]], although not in any automatic or mechanistic fashion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nSt. Maximus, whose teaching is cited by St, Gregory, says that the Apostles saw the uncreated Light <ref>\"by a transformation of the activity of their senses, produced in them by the Spirit\" (2.3.22).

Characteristic of such an approach is the saying of Anselm of Canterbury: \"I believe so as to understand\". The Scholastics acknowledged God at the outset and then endeavoured to prove His existence by logical arguments and rational categories. In the Orthodox Church, as expressed by the Holy Fathers, faith is God revealing Himself to man. We accept faith by hearing it not so that we can understand it rationally, but so that we can cleanse our hearts, attain to faith by \"theoria\" and experience the Revelation of God.

He further characterized the Eastern canonization of Palamas's teachings as a \"resurrection of polytheism\".<ref name=Vailhe2>\"Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies.

Patrick Carey asserts that, before Meyendorff's 1959 doctoral dissertation on Palamas, Palamism was considered by Western theologians to be a \"curious and sui generis example of medieval Byzantium's intellectual decline\".  Andreas Andreopoulos cites the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia article by Fortescue as an example of how Barlaam's distrustful and hostile attitude regarding hesychasm survived until recently in the West, adding that now \"the Western world has started to rediscover what amounts to a lost tradition. Hesychasm, which was never anything close to a scholar's pursuit, is now studied by Western theologians who are astounded by the profound thought and spirituality of late Byzantium.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1UZCTtEuGcMC&pg=PA215&dq=hesychasm+catholic&hl=en&ei=LH9rTJmdCMWOjAeCvtzWAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hesychasm%20catholic&f=falseAndreasAndreopoulos,''Metamorphosis: The Transfiguration in Byzantine Theology and Iconography'' (St Vladimir's Seminary Press 2005], {{ISBN|0-88141-295-3}}), pp. 215\u2013216</ref> Carey characterizes Meyendorff's thesis as a landmark study of Palamas that \"set Palamas firmly within the context of Greek patristic thought and spirituality\" with the result that Palamism is now generally understood to be \"a faithful witness to the long-standing Eastern Christian emphasis on deification (theosis) as the purpose of the divine economy in Christ.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Biographical dictionary of Christian theologians|first1=Patrick W. |last1=Carey |first2=Joseph T. |last2=Lienhard|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2000 |page=362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg0gOJhFI0UC&pg=PA362&dq=%22Palamism%22+%22Orthodox+Church%22&hl=en&ei=H6kaTebIJYKssAOXhLTiCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Palamism%22%20%22Orthodox%20Church%22&f=false}}</ref> Meyendorff himself describes  the twentieth-century rehabilitation of Palamas in the Western Church as a \"remarkable event in the history of scholarship.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Gregory Palamas |author=Saint Gregory Palamas|publisher=Paulist Press |year=1983|page=xi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcjtUbwptwC&pg=PR11&dq=Palamas+Meyendorff+Nicene+doctrine&hl=en&ei=4iQXTf_BE4SWhQfI5qi3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nAccording to [[Kallistos Ware]], some Western theologians, both Roman Catholic and Anglican, see the theology of Palamas as introducing an inadmissible division within God.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ognCKztR8a4C&pg=PA186&dq=hesychasm+catholic&hl=en&ei=uIxrTOCaOs3uOb2qoKQB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=hesychasm%20catholic&f=falseKallistosWarein ''Oxford Companion to Christian Thought'' (Oxford University Press 2000] {{ISBN|0-19-860024-0}}), p. 186</ref> However, some Western scholars maintain that there is no conflict between Palamas's teaching and Roman Catholic thought.<ref>\"Several Western scholars contend that the teaching of St. Gregory Palamas himself is compatible with Roman Catholic thought on the matter\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DgtUoMqm594C&pg=PA243&dq=%22Several+Western+scholars+contend%22&hl=en&ei=hIYXTbXZOo-asAO_oPHaCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Several%20Western%20scholars%20contend%22&f=falseMichael J.

He argues that Eastern Churches, since their very beginning were to some extent influenced by [[Neo-Platonism]] and other Eastern philosophies, this is why most of the heresies combated by the early Church originated in the East. He also states that [[Plotinus]] might have been influenced by monistic forms of Hindu Philosophy during his voyages with the army of [[Gordian III]] to Persia. <ref>http://waragainstbeing.com/?s=gnosticism+the+nest+of+the+antichrist</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam of Calabria]]\n*[[Barlaamism]]\n*[[Divinization (Christian)|Deification in Christianity]]\n*[[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology]]\n*[[Fifth Council of Constantinople]]\n*[[Gennadius Scholarius]]\n*[[Gregory Akindynos]]\n*[[Hesychast controversy]]\n*[[Isidore I of Constantinople]]\n*[[John Kyparissiotes]]\n*[[John XIV of Constantinople]]\n*[[Mark of Ephesus]]\n*[[Neo-Palamism]]\n*[[Nicephorus Gregoras]]\n*[[Essence\u2013energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|''Ousia''-''energeia'' distinction]]\n*[[Scotism]]\n*[[Theological differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox\u2013Roman Catholic theological differences]]\n*[[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|''Theosis'']]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Vladimir Lossky]] The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997.
