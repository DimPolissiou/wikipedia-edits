The [[Saxe-Coburg]] family was perceived to be too closely linked with British interests. The [[Coburg]] influence extended widely. In [[Great Britain]], [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] were Leopold's first cousins, while [[Leopold I of Belgium]] was Leopold's paternal and [[Queen Victoria]]'s maternal uncle, and Leopold's brother was King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]], husband of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]].

It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the winter solstice is the day with the shortest period of daylight and longest night of the year, when the Sun is at its lowest [[Culmination|daily maximum elevation]] in the sky.<ref>{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Physical Science |edition=12th |first1=James |last1=Shipman |first2=Jerry D. |last2=Wilson |first3=Aaron |last3=Todd |chapter=Section 15.5 |page=423 |isbn=978-0-618-92696-1 |year=2007 |location=Boston|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]}}</ref> At the pole, there is [[Polar night|continuous darkness or twilight]] around the winter solstice.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], this is the [[December solstice]] (usually 21 or 22 December) and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], this is the [[June solstice]] (usually 20 or 21 June). Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment, the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs. Other names are \"midwinter\", the \"extreme of winter\" ([[Dongzhi (solar term)|Dongzhi]]), or the \"shortest day\". Traditionally, in many [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter, but today in some countries and calendars, it is seen as the beginning of winter. In [[meteorology]], winter is reckoned as beginning about three weeks before the winter solstice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/when-does-spring-start|title=When does spring start?|date=June 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |publisher=[[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n\nSince prehistory, the winter solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/winter_solstice.htm|title=Winter Solstice celebrations: a.k.a.

Astronomical events were often used to guide activities, such as the [[mating of animals]], the sowing of crops and the monitoring of winter reserves of food. Many cultural mythologies and traditions are derived from this.\n\nThis is attested by physical remains in the layouts of late Neolithic and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, such as [[Stonehenge]] in England and [[Newgrange]] in Ireland. The primary [[wikt:axis|axes]] of both of these monuments seem to have been carefully aligned on a sight-line pointing to the winter solstice sunrise (Newgrange) and the winter solstice sunset (Stonehenge). It is significant that at Stonehenge the Great [[Trilithon]] was oriented outwards from the middle of the monument, i.e. its smooth flat face was turned towards the midwinter Sun.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Anthony |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=[[Thames & Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780500051559 |pages=252\u2013253}}</ref>\n\nThe winter solstice was immensely important because the people were economically dependent on monitoring the progress of the seasons. [[Starvation]] was common during the first months of the winter, January to April (northern hemisphere) or July to October (southern hemisphere), also known as \"the [[famine]] months\". In temperate climates, the midwinter festival was the last feast [[Festival|celebration]], before deep winter began. Most cattle were [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed so they would not have to be fed during the winter, so it was almost the only time of year when a plentiful supply of fresh meat was available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas | title=History of Christmas |publisher=History.com |accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> The majority of wine and beer made during the year was finally [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and ready for drinking at this time.

[[Yald\u0101 Night|Yalda night]] celebration, or as some call it \"Shabe Chelleh\" (\"the 40th night\"), is one the oldest Iranian traditions that has been present in Persian culture from the ancient years. In this night all the family gather together, usually at the house of the eldest, and celebrate it by eating, drinking and reciting poetry (esp. Hafez). Nuts, pomegranates and watermelons are particularly served during this festival.\n\n===Germanic===\n{{main|Yule}}\nThe [[Norse paganism|pagan Scandinavian]] and [[Germanic people]] of northern Europe celebrated a winter holiday called [[Yule]] (also called Jul, Julblot, j\u00f3labl\u00f3t). The ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes a Yule feast hosted by the Norwegian king [[Haakon the Good]] (c. 920\u2013961). According to Snorri, the Christian Haakon had moved Yule from \"midwinter\" and aligned it with the Christian Christmas celebration. Historically, this has made some scholars believe that Yule originally was a sun festival on the winter solstice. Modern scholars generally do not believe this, as midwinter in medieval Iceland was a date about four weeks after the solstice.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nordberg |first=Andreas |year=2006 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1366945/Jul_disting_och_f%C3%B6rkyrklig_tider%C3%A4kning |title=Jul, disting och f\u00f6rkyrklig tider\u00e4kning: Kalendrar och kalendariska riter i det f\u00f6rkristna Norden |series=Acta Academiae Regiae Gustavi Adolphi |language=Swedish |volume=91 |publisher=Kungl.

However, by use of [[astronomy|astronomical data tracking]], the precise timing of its occurrence is now public knowledge. One cannot directly detect the precise instant of the solstice (by definition, one cannot observe that an object has stopped moving until one later observes that it has not moved further from the preceding spot, or that it has moved in the opposite direction){{Citation needed|reason=Dubious scientific claim for event on a macro scale.|date=December 2014}}. Further, to be precise to a single day, one must be able to observe a change in [[azimuth]] or elevation less than or equal to about 1/60 of the angular diameter of the Sun. Observing that it occurred within a two-day period is easier, requiring an observation precision of only about 1/16 of the angular diameter of the Sun. Thus, many observations are of the day of the solstice rather than the instant.

It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern).

Its opposite is the [[summer solstice]].\n\nThe winter solstice occurs during the hemisphere's [[winter]]. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], this is the [[December solstice]] (usually 21 or 22 December) and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], this is the [[June solstice]] (usually 20 or 21 June). Although the winter solstice itself lasts only a moment, the term sometimes refers to the day on which it occurs. Other names are \"midwinter\", the \"extreme of winter\" ([[Dongzhi (solar term)|Dongzhi]]), or the \"shortest day\". Traditionally, in many [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, the winter solstice is seen as the middle of winter, but today in some countries and calendars, it is seen as the beginning of winter. In [[meteorology]], winter is reckoned as beginning about three weeks before the winter solstice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/when-does-spring-start|title=When does spring start?|date=June 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |publisher=[[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n\nSince prehistory, the winter solstice has been seen as a significant time of year in many cultures, and has been marked by festivals and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/winter_solstice.htm|title=Winter Solstice celebrations: a.k.a.

Astronomical events were often used to guide activities, such as the [[mating of animals]], the sowing of crops and the monitoring of winter reserves of food. Many cultural mythologies and traditions are derived from this.\n\nThis is attested by physical remains in the layouts of late Neolithic and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, such as [[Stonehenge]] in England and [[Newgrange]] in Ireland. The primary [[wikt:axis|axes]] of both of these monuments seem to have been carefully aligned on a sight-line pointing to the winter solstice sunrise (Newgrange) and the winter solstice sunset (Stonehenge). It is significant that at Stonehenge the Great [[Trilithon]] was oriented outwards from the middle of the monument, i.e. its smooth flat face was turned towards the midwinter Sun.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Anthony |title=Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma |publisher=[[Thames & Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780500051559 |pages=252\u2013253}}</ref>\n\nThe winter solstice was immensely important because the people were economically dependent on monitoring the progress of the seasons. [[Starvation]] was common during the first months of the winter, January to April (northern hemisphere) or July to October (southern hemisphere), also known as \"the [[famine]] months\". In temperate climates, the midwinter festival was the last feast [[Festival|celebration]], before deep winter began. Most cattle were [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]ed so they would not have to be fed during the winter, so it was almost the only time of year when a plentiful supply of fresh meat was available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas | title=History of Christmas |publisher=History.com |accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> The majority of wine and beer made during the year was finally [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] and ready for drinking at this time. The concentration of the observances were not always on the day commencing at midnight or at dawn, but at the beginning of the pagan day, which in many cultures fell on the previous [[evening|eve]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBecause the event was seen as the reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky, concepts of the birth or rebirth of [[sun god]]s have been common. {{Citation needed|date=February  2020}} In cultures which used cyclic calendars based on the winter solstice, the \"year as reborn\" was celebrated with reference to [[Life-death-rebirth deity|life-death-rebirth deities]] or \"new beginnings\" such as [[Hogmanay]]'s ''redding'', a [[New Year]] cleaning tradition. {{Citation needed|date=February  2020}} Also \"reversal\" is yet another frequent theme, as in [[Saturnalia]]'s slave and master reversals.\n\n===Indian===\n{{main| Makar Sankranti}}\nMakara Sankranti, also known as Makaraa Sankr\u0101nti ([[Sanskrit]]: \u092e\u0915\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f) or Maghi, is a festival day in the [[Hindu calendar]], in reference to deity [[Surya]] (sun).

[[Yald\u0101 Night|Yalda night]] celebration, or as some call it \"Shabe Chelleh\" (\"the 40th night\"), is one the oldest Iranian traditions that has been present in Persian culture from the ancient years. In this night all the family gather together, usually at the house of the eldest, and celebrate it by eating, drinking and reciting poetry (esp. Hafez). Nuts, pomegranates and watermelons are particularly served during this festival.\n\n===Germanic===\n{{main|Yule}}\nThe [[Norse paganism|pagan Scandinavian]] and [[Germanic people]] of northern Europe celebrated a winter holiday called [[Yule]] (also called Jul, Julblot, j\u00f3labl\u00f3t). The ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes a Yule feast hosted by the Norwegian king [[Haakon the Good]] (c. 920\u2013961). According to Snorri, the Christian Haakon had moved Yule from \"midwinter\" and aligned it with the Christian Christmas celebration. Historically, this has made some scholars believe that Yule originally was a sun festival on the winter solstice. Modern scholars generally do not believe this, as midwinter in medieval Iceland was a date about four weeks after the solstice.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nordberg |first=Andreas |year=2006 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1366945/Jul_disting_och_f%C3%B6rkyrklig_tider%C3%A4kning |title=Jul, disting och f\u00f6rkyrklig tider\u00e4kning: Kalendrar och kalendariska riter i det f\u00f6rkristna Norden |series=Acta Academiae Regiae Gustavi Adolphi |language=Swedish |volume=91 |publisher=Kungl.

However, by use of [[astronomy|astronomical data tracking]], the precise timing of its occurrence is now public knowledge. One cannot directly detect the precise instant of the solstice (by definition, one cannot observe that an object has stopped moving until one later observes that it has not moved further from the preceding spot, or that it has moved in the opposite direction){{Citation needed|reason=Dubious scientific claim for event on a macro scale.|date=December 2014}}. Further, to be precise to a single day, one must be able to observe a change in [[azimuth]] or elevation less than or equal to about 1/60 of the angular diameter of the Sun. Observing that it occurred within a two-day period is easier, requiring an observation precision of only about 1/16 of the angular diameter of the Sun. Thus, many observations are of the day of the solstice rather than the instant. This is often done by observing sunrise and sunset or using an [[Archaeoastronomy|astronomically aligned instrument]] that allows a ray of light to be cast on a certain point around that time. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates differ from winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Goseck-2.jpg|[[Neolithic]] site of [[Goseck circle]].

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. These effort to grow the game in the area ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

Origin of the members of this band was from across the south of the country. Most of them had been imprisoned during the communist regime for crimes. Called by his nickname \"The strongest of the South\", this band had as main rival [[Coles gang]] led by Zani \u00c7aushi. Banda was the well to Brother ardent supporter of the Democratic Party, and apparently this caused even their elimination.\n==Levan Massacre==\n\nLevan massacre occurred on 28 March 1997, and was the bloodiest clash of the riots of 1997. In this violent crash were killed 24 people, 18 white and 6 Roma. The clash took place between Gang of Pusi i Mezinit and the roma residents of the village of [[Levan, Fier|Levan]] in [[Fier]]. The whole Gang of Pusi i Mezinit was eliminated during the collision. \n\nAccording to the police, gang members had recently escaped from prison and missed out on the opening of the military depots and were short of weapons. They went to Levan to take Kalashnikovs from roma villagers, because they believed the roma had too many. The gang members had been celebrating the release from prison at \u201cKlubi i Ilias\u201d in Fier and after consuming large amounts of alcohol went to a bar in Levan and over drinks demanded from the local roma leader one Kalashnikov for each of their gang members. The roma leader explained that the roma had only one Kalashnikov per person and had turned in all the extras at the police station in Fier. Arguments followed and the gang members shot and killed the roma leader and began shooting other roma customers in the bar. Local Roma villagers quickly surrounded the bar and demanded the gang's surrender. Even though they were drunk and poorly armed, the gang continued shooting from inside until they ran out of ammunition. Only three gang members who were sober enough were able to escape. All the remaining gang members were executed by the roma in fear of revenge.\n\nOnly ten days later, seven young roma were massacred near Tepelena in retaliation by friends of the gang. One month later Levan was attacked with heavy artillery by gangs from Vlora and drive by shootings from the Vlore-Fier road became frequent in Levan. Roma started organizing their own defense, however several roma have left Levan since then and moved to Tirana and Durr\u00ebs.\n\n===Trap charges===\nFormer bodyguard of Sali Berisha, and the organiser of the coup of 14 September 1998, '''Izet Haxhia''' accused '''Agim Shehu''' and the director of the Vlora Police Station during 1997, '''Milto Kordha''' (located in his office illegally Rescue Committee) that have raised the trap band of Vlora: \n''Members of that gang were some of the strongest of those years as Tit Saleci, Felja and members of the Mukaj family in Vlora.

Origin of the members of this band was from across the south of the country. Most of them had been imprisoned during the communist regime for crimes. Called by his nickname \"The strongest of the South\", this band had as main rival [[Coles gang]] led by Zani \u00c7aushi. Banda was the well to Brother ardent supporter of the Democratic Party, and apparently this caused even their elimination.\n==Levan Massacre==\n\nLevan massacre occurred on 28 March 1997, and was the bloodiest clash of the riots of 1997. In this violent crash were killed 24 people, 18 white and 6 Roma. The clash took place between Gang of Pusi i Mezinit and the roma residents of the village of [[Levan, Fier|Levan]] in [[Fier]]. The whole Gang of Pusi i Mezinit was eliminated during the collision. \n\nAccording to the police, gang members had recently escaped from prison and missed out on the opening of the military depots and were short of weapons. They went to Levan to take Kallashnikovs from roma villagers, because they believed the roma had too many. The gang members had been celebrating the release from prison at \u201cKlubi i Ilias\u201d in Fier and after consuming large amounts of alcohol went to a bar in Levan and over drinks demanded from the local roma leader one Kallashnikov for each of their gang members. The roma leader explained that the roma had only one Kallashnikov per person and had turned in all the extras at the police station in Fier. Arguments followed and the gang members shot and killed the roma leader and began shooting other roma customers in the bar. Local Roma villagers quickly surrounded the bar and demanded the gang's surrender. Even though they were drunk and poorly armed, the gang continued shooting from inside until they ran out of ammunition. Only three gang members who were sober enough were able to escape. All the remaining gang members were executed by the roma in fear of revenge.\n\nOnly ten days later, seven young roma were massacred near Tepelena in retaliation by friends of the gang. One month later Levan was attacked with heavy artillery by gangs from Vlora and drive by shootings from the Vlore-Fier road became frequent in Levan. Roma started organizing their own defense, however several roma have left Levan since then and moved to Tirana and Durr\u00ebs.\n\n===Trap charges===\nFormer bodyguard of Sali Berisha, and the organiser of the coup of 14 September 1998, '''Izet Haxhia''' accused '''Agim Shehu''' and the director of the Vlora Police Station during 1997, '''Milto Kordha''' (located in his office illegally Rescue Committee) that have raised the trap band of Vlora: \n''Members of that gang were some of the strongest of those years as Tit Saleci, Felja and members of the Mukaj family in Vlora.

He was later buried in the crypt below this church, as were his wife, his three sons, his daughter-in-law [[Princess Leopoldina of Brazil|Leopoldina]] and her four sons.\n\nAugust was a recipient of the [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Saxe-Ernestine House Order]], the Portuguese royal [[Order of the Tower and Sword]], the French [[Legion of Honour]] and the Belgian royal [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].

The sculpture still stands on private land in [[Ebenthal, Lower Austria|Ebenthal]] owned by the Saxe-Coburg ducal family. The base of the sculpture contains a Latin inscription and a text in French: {{lang|fr|Auguste Louis Victor Duc de Saxe Prince de Saxe Cobourg Gotha. A mon mari bien aim\u00e8. 1843 - 1881. Cl\u00e9mentine.}} (\"August Louis Victor, Duke of Saxony, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. To my beloved husband.\" &mdash; 1843 is not the year August was born (he was born in 1818), but rather the year he married Cl\u00e9mentine).\n\n== Marriage and issue ==\nIn [[Saint-Cloud]] on 20 April 1843 August married [[Princess Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]], daughter of [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe, King of the French]]. They had five children:\n# [[Prince Philipp of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ferdinand Philipp Maria August Raphael]] (b. Paris, 28 March 1844 - d. Coburg, 3 July 1921).\n# [[Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Ludwig August Maria Eudes]] (b. Ch\u00e2teau d'Eu, 8 August 1845 - d. Karlsbad, 14 September 1907), married on 15 December 1864 to [[Princess Leopoldina of Brazil]].\n# [[Princess Clotilde of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Marie Adelaide Amalie Clotilde]] (b. Neuilly, 8 July 1846 - d. Alcs\u00fat, Hungary, 3 June 1927), married on 12 May 1864 to [[Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria]].\n# [[Princess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Marie Luise Franziska Amalie]] (b. Coburg, 23 October 1848 - d.

Vienna, 26 February 1861 - d. Coburg, 10 September 1948), installed as Prince of Bulgaria on 7 July 1887; raised to [[Czar]] of Bulgaria on {{OldStyleDate|22 September|1908|5 October}}.\n\nOn 2 May 1881, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] bestowed upon August and his descendants the style of ''Hoheit'' (\"[[Highness]]\"), a higher style in Germany than ''Durchlaucht'' (\"[[Serene Highness]]\"), which [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine]] princes were usually entitled to. The reason for the grant was that eight days later [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Belgium]] (younger sister of August's daughter-in-law [[Princess Louise of Belgium|Louise]]) was to marry Franz Joseph's son [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]]; Franz Joseph considered it appropriate that his son's in-laws have a higher rank at the Austrian court.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Honours ==\nHe received the following awards:<ref name = \"Handbuch\">''Staatshandbuch f\u00fcr die Herzogth\u00fcmer Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha'' (1865). \"Genealogie des Herzogliche Hauses\", [https://zs.thulb.uni-jena.de/rsc/viewer/jportal_derivate_00244505/Sachsen_Coburg_Gotha_170545237_1865_0024.tif?logicalDiv=jportal_jparticle_00483244 p. 11].

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation.

Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Its [[ski resort]] ''Silvretta Arena Ischgl-Samnaun'' is connected with the ski resort of [[Samnaun]] across the border in [[Switzerland]] to form one of the largest skiing resorts in the [[Alps]]. Ischgl was a major hotspot of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]].\n\n==Ski resort==\nIschgl is located on the Austrian side of one of the world's largest ski areas. Its {{convert|238|km|||}} of groomed pistes are served by over 45 mechanical lifts including [[Aerial tramway|cable cars]], [[Gondola lift|gondolas]], [[Detachable chairlift|detachable chair lifts]] and some [[T-bar lift|T-bars]]. Three ropeways give access to the ski area from the village: the Pardatschgratbahn, the Fimbabahn & the Silvrettabahn. Only the Fimbabahn and the Silvrettabahn have middle stations.<ref name=\"ischgl.com\">[http://www.ischgl.com/ Ischgl.com]</ref> Many of the lifts converge at Idalp, where there is a restaurant. The area above Idalp offers wide, easy pistes and a snow park. Other parts of the Ischgl area, towards H\u00f6llboden and Paznauner Thaya, offer many red runs and some more challenging blacks. The steepest run in the resort is a black run with a gradient of 70%, located in the H\u00f6llboden bowl, and accessed by the \"Lange Wand\" chair lift. Paznauner Thaya offers many red runs suitable for intermediate-level skiers.\n\nIschgl is known for lively [[apr\u00e8s-ski]] parties and nightlife. The resort hosts pop concerts celebrating the end of the annual ski season (''Top of the Mountain Concert'') at the Idalp ({{convert|2300|m|disp=or||}}).
