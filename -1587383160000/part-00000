The game was held on July 8, 1941, at [[Briggs Stadium]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the home of the [[Detroit Tigers]] of the American League.\n\n==Result==\nThe American League defeated the National League, 7\u20135. With the NL leading 5\u20134, two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, and [[Joe Gordon]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] of the [[New York Yankees]] on base; [[Ted Williams]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] hit a [[walk-off home run]] off of [[Claude Passeau]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]] to win it for the AL.<ref name=retro/>\n\nPrior to Williams' at-bat DiMaggio hit a potential game-ending double play groundball. However, [[Billy Herman]]\u2019s relay throw pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag, thus extending the game and setting up William\u2019s at-bat.\n\nIn the end, the AL\u2019s dramatic 7-to-4 walk-off win overshadowed two home runs hit by Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop [[Arky Vaughan]], which had given the NL 3-to-2 and 5-to-2 leads in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively.\n\n\n[[File:Ted_Williams_&_Joe_DiMaggio_1941_MLB_All-Star_Game.jpg|thumb|center|[[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Joe DiMaggio]] after the game]]\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe game began as a pitcher\u2019s duel between [[Bob Feller]] (Cleveland, AL) and [[Whit Wyatt]] (Brooklyn, NL), who pitched three and two scoreless innings, respectively. It wasn\u2019t until the fourth inning that either team put a runner in scoring position, when doubles by [[Cecil Travis]] (Washington) and [[Ted Williams]] off the second NL hurler, [[Paul Derringer]] (Cincinnati), put the AL ahead 1-0.\n\nIn the sixth inning the NL used a lead-off double by [[Bucky Waters]] (Cincinnati) to tie the game at 1-1 with the help of two sacrifices: a bunt by [[Stan Hack]] (Chicago Cubs) to move Waters to third and a sacrifice fly by [[Terry Moore (baseball)|Terry Moore]] (St. Louis Cardinals) to allow him to score.\n\nHowever, the AL quickly answered in the bottom half of the same inning when Cleveland shortstop [[Lou Boudreau]] (who had entered the game for [[Joe Cronin]]) singled home [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was one of two American Leaguers to reach base via a walk that frame, for a 2-to-1 AL lead.\n\nThe top halves of the seventh and eighth innings saw the heroics of [[Arky Vaughan]], who hit a two-run home run in each to also score two St. Louis Cardinals players: [[Enos Slaughter]], who had opened the seventh inning with a single, and [[Johnny Mize]], who had preceded Vaughan\u2019s round-tripper in the eighth with a one-out double.\n\nWith the score now 5-2 in favor of the National League the first pair of brothers to ever appear together in an All-Star Game cut into the NL lead, when [[Dominic DiMaggio]] - in his first plate appearance of the game - singled home Joe after his one-out double.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/all_star_event.jsp?story=15</ref>\n\nIn the ninth inning, White Sox hurler [[Eddie Smith (baseball)|Eddie Smith]], who had given up one of Vaughan\u2019s home runs, retired the NL in order in his second inning of work. One of the three NL hitters to step to the plate that half-inning was pitcher [[Claude Passeau]], who - with his team trailing 5-3 - was not pulled for a pinch hitter, and thus returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth for his third inning of work. (The only position player left on the NL bench, [[Cookie Lavagetto]], was inserted as a pinch hitter one batter after Passeau's at-bat.)\n\nWith one out in the bottom of the ninth, three consecutive AL batters reached base, putting the tying and go-ahead runs on base and bringing [[Joe DiMaggio]] to the plate. The \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d then hit what some sources describe as a routine double-play groundball, which would have ended the ballgame. However, the relay throw from second to first by [[Billy Herman]] pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag and extended the game.\n\nWith the NL still leading 5-4 (a run had scored on DiMaggio\u2019s groundout), the AL now had the tying run on third and the winning run on first. Not electing to walk [[Ted Williams]], which would have advanced the winning run to second base and brought [[Dominic DiMaggio]] to the plate, NL manager [[Bill McKechnie]], let [[Claude Passeau]] pitch to [[Ted Williams]]. With the count two balls and one strike Williams hit a three-run home run off the third deck of the right field stands of Detroit\u2019s [[Briggs Stadium]] for a 7-to-5 American League victory.\n\n==Context & Aftermath==\n\nThe 1941 All Star Game took place in the midst of [[Joe DiMaggio]]\u2019s astounding 56-game hitting streak (but did not count towards it, since the All Star Game is considered an exhibition game). DiMaggio had equaled the all-time record of 44 games, set by [[Willie Keeler]] in 1897, seven days prior to the All Star Game and broken it the day after that (July 1 and 2, respectively).<ref>https://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats3.shtml</ref> The streak would end nine days after the All Star Game, when DiMaggio went hitless on July 17 against the Cleveland Indians.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/14/sports/ken-keltner-75-indians-infielder-who-helped-end-dimaggio-streak.html</ref>\n\n[[Ted Williams]], whose batting average was at .405 at the time of the All Star Game, would even slightly top that hitting pace for the rest of the season and end the 1941 campaign at .406, making him the last hitter to reach the .400 mark for a season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=willite01&t=b&year=1941</ref>\n\nThe 1941 baseball season, of which the All Star Game marked the halfway point, took place right before the United States would enter World War II. The juxtaposition of that memorable season taking place with the war looming is illustrated in the book Baseball in \u201941 by renowned sportswriter [[Robert Creamer]].<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-w-creamer/baseball-in-41/</ref> Although the Major League season and the World Series would continue to be played during the war years, the All Star Game was cancelled in 1945 due to war-time travel restrictions.\n\nThe fact that [[Arky Vaughan]] was eventually denied the accolades of being the player of the game despite his two home runs can be seen as symbolic of his entire career: Despite arguably being the preeminent offensive shortstop of his time, hitting .300 or higher in 12 of his 14 Major League seasons,<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/vaughar01.shtml</ref> Vaughan wasn\u2019t inducted into the Hall of Fame until 1985 (posthumously, by the Veterans Committee, nearly four decades after his last major league appearance) and is not remembered as vividly as many of the other stars of this era.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/4e00be9b</ref>\n\n\n==Rosters==\nPlayers in ''italics'' have since been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===National League===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;

It wasn\u2019t until the fourth inning that either team put a runner in scoring position, when doubles by [[Cecil Travis]] (Washington) and [[Ted Williams]] off the second NL hurler, [[Paul Derringer]] (Cincinnati), put the AL ahead 1-0.\n\nIn the sixth inning the NL used a lead-off double by [[Bucky Waters]] (Cincinnati) to tie the game at 1-1 with the help of two sacrifices: a bunt by [[Stan Hack]] (Chicago Cubs) to move Waters to third and a sacrifice fly by [[Terry Moore (baseball)|Terry Moore]] (St. Louis Cardinals) to allow him to score.\n\nHowever, the AL quickly answered in the bottom half of the same inning when Cleveland shortstop [[Lou Boudreau]] (who had entered the game for [[Joe Cronin]]) singled home [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was one of two American Leaguers to reach base via a walk that frame, for a 2-to-1 AL lead.\n\nThe top halves of the seventh and eighth innings saw the heroics of [[Arky Vaughan]], who hit a two-run home run in each to also score two St. Louis Cardinals players: [[Enos Slaughter]], who had opened the seventh inning with a single, and [[Johnny Mize]], who had preceded Vaughan\u2019s round-tripper in the eighth with a one-out double.\n\nWith the score now 5-2 in favor of the National League the first pair of brothers to ever appear together in an All-Star Game cut into the NL lead, when [[Dominic DiMaggio]] - in his first plate appearance of the game - singled home Joe after his one-out double.<ref>http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/all_star_event.jsp?story=15</ref>\n\nIn the ninth inning, White Sox hurler [[Eddie Smith]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, who had given up one of Vaughan\u2019s home runs, retired the NL in order in his second inning of work. One of the three NL hitters to step to the plate that half-inning was pitcher [[Claude Passeau]], who - with his team trailing 5-3 - was not pulled for a pinch hitter, and thus returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth for his third inning of work. (The only position player left on the NL bench, [[Cookie Lavagetto]], was inserted as a pinch hitter one batter after Passeau's at-bat.)\n\nWith one out in the bottom of the ninth, three consecutive AL batters reached base, putting the tying and go-ahead runs on base and bringing [[Joe DiMaggio]] to the plate. The \u201cYankee Clipper\u201d then hit what some sources describe as a routine double-play groundball, which would have ended the ballgame. However, the relay throw from second to first by [[Billy Herman]] pulled first baseman [[Frank McCormick]] off the bag and extended the game.\n\nWith the NL still leading 5-4 (a run had scored on DiMaggio\u2019s groundout), the AL now had the tying run on third and the winning run on first. Not electing to walk [[Ted Williams]], which would have advanced the winning run to second base and brought [[Dominic DiMaggio]] to the plate, NL manager [[Bill McKechnie]], let [[Claude Passeau]] pitch to [[Ted Williams]]. With the count two balls and one strike Williams hit a three-run home run off the third deck of the right field stands of Detroit\u2019s [[Briggs Stadium]] for a 7-to-5 American League victory.\n\n==Context & Aftermath==\n\nThe 1941 All Star Game took place in the midst of [[Joe DiMaggio]]\u2019s astounding 56-game hitting streak (but did not count towards it, since the All Star Game is considered an exhibition game). DiMaggio had equaled the all-time record of 44 games, set by [[Willie Keeler]] in 1897, seven days prior to the All Star Game and broken it the day after that (July 1 and 2, respectively). <ref>https://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats3.shtml</ref> The streak would end nine days after the All Star Game, when DiMaggio went hitless on July 17 against the Cleveland Indians.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/14/sports/ken-keltner-75-indians-infielder-who-helped-end-dimaggio-streak.html</ref>\n\n[[Ted Williams]], whose batting average was at .405 at the time of the All Star Game, would even slightly top that hitting pace for the rest of the season and end the 1941 campaign at .406, making him the last hitter to reach the .400 mark for a season.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=willite01&t=b&year=1941</ref>\n\nThe 1941 baseball season, of which the All Star Game marked the halfway point, took place right before the United States would enter World War II. The juxtaposition of that memorable season taking place with the war looming is illustrated in the book Baseball in \u201941 by renowned sportswriter [[Robert Creamer]].<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-w-creamer/baseball-in-41/</ref> Although the Major League season and the World Series would continue to be played during the war years, the All Star Game was cancelled in 1945 due to war-time travel restrictions.\n\nThe fact that [[Arky Vaughan]] was eventually denied the accolades of being the player of the game despite his two home runs can be seen as symbolic of his entire career: Despite arguably being the preeminent offensive shortstop of his time, hitting .300 or higher in 12 of his 14 Major League seasons,<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/vaughar01.shtml</ref> Vaughan wasn\u2019t inducted into the Hall of Fame until 1985 (posthumously, by the Veterans Committee, nearly four decades after his last major league appearance) and is not remembered as vividly as many of the other stars of this era.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/4e00be9b</ref>\n\n\n==Rosters==\nPlayers in ''italics'' have since been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===National League===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;

Anne was the first parish established in the area, dating back to 1856, when the territory was a part of [[Rupert's Land]]. The early settlers, [[French language|French]]-speaking [[Habitants]] from [[Canada East]], arrived looking for farmland. The first 198 families in the community busied themselves with their first major industry, supplying lumber for the construction of the [[St. Boniface Cathedral]]. The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] also had a strong presence in the community in the 1800s. Ste. Anne served as a stopover for weary travelers on their journey to [[Winnipeg]], along the famed Dawson Trail.\n\nIn June 1959, Ste. Anne experienced the worst flood in its history.

The crew, led by Gordon Cozier, consists of John, A.J., and brothers Jake and Jesse Attica. The crew is without a former member, Ghost, who was caught during a previous robbery five years before. In his absence, Jake began a relationship with Ghost's former girlfriend Lilly, who has accepted his marriage proposal.\n\nAfter Ghost is released from prison, he meets up with the crew to plan a heist, in which it is discovered that two trucks will travel together, but that all the money is kept in the lead truck, which holds $12 million.\n\nThe crew, dressed as construction workers, hide out underground, while Ghost poses as a police officer, so he can keep an eye out for the trucks. Meanwhile, in order to cover themselves in case Ghost is setting them up, John heads to the top of a nearby garage to take out Ghost with a sniper rifle in case things go wrong. The crew plan to dentonate the blast when the armored trucks drive overhead, causing the trucks to fall underground. However, a bicyclist causes the lead driver to stop short and the explosives are detonated too early. The lead driver radios the police, while armed guards pile out of the rear truck.\n\nA gunfight ensues between the robbers in the crater and the guards on the street, until John commandeers the rear truck and rams the lead truck into the crater where the crew cut into it. John and the other robbers pack the cash into bags, and flee by heading down a variety of different tunnels, with the plan of connecting into various subway lines to make their escape.\n\nWelles and Hatcher show up on the scene, and, after learning of the robbers' escape through the sewer system, remember a map of the city subway system from the Russian gang hideout, and deduce that they must be escaping through the stations marked on the map where the sewers intersect the subway. They rush to the nearest station, where they find Jesse, and a chase ensues, during which Jesse hides his bag of money and is cornered, and is forced to shoot Detective Hatcher in his escape. Jesse escapes, while Welles stops to aid his partner, who dies from his wound.\n\nJesse reconvenes with the rest of the crew at a hotel room, and admits to the shooting of Hatcher. It is now revealed that Ghost had previously cut a deal with the Russian gangsters to kill his former accomplices in exchange for half of the heist's take. Ghost gives the Russians the hotel room number, then escapes out the bathroom window, just before the Russians storm the room and attempt to kill the crew. A.J. dies in the ensuing firefight, but the rest of the crew is able to kill the Russians and flee the building before the police arrive. Jake and Jesse return home where, to their horror, Jake finds Lilly's corpse, and Jesse finds the safe where they kept their secret stash of money opened and cleaned out. The police surround their bar, and shoot the two when they make a suicide charge outside, killing them.\n\nGordon and John separate to make their escape, but realize that Ghost intends to take all of their money, which is being held by Scott, a well-connected [[fence (criminal)|fence]]. Ghost sneaks onto Scott's private plane and kills him, taking their laundered money in two suitcases. Gordon and Detective Welles arrive, and a three-way [[Mexican standoff]] results in which Ghost hits both Gordon and Welles. As Ghost prepares to finish Gordon off, John arrives and shoots him dead. John recognizes Welles as the same cop, who was with the little girl. John and Gordon refuse to kill Welles. John and an injured Gordon take the money and drive off, with Gordon's sister Naomi in tow. A gravely-wounded Welles manages to call 911 for help on his cell phone.\n\nThe film ends without revealing whether either Gordon or Welles survive their injuries.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Matt Dillon]] as Jack Welles\n*[[Paul Walker]] as John Rahway\n*[[Idris Elba]] as Gordon Cozier\n*[[Jay Hernandez]] as Eddie \"Hatch\" Hatcher\n*[[Michael Ealy]] as Jake Attica\n*[[T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]] as Delonte \"Ghost\" Rivers\n*[[Chris Brown]] as Jesse Attica\n*[[Hayden Christensen]] as A.J.\n*[[Zoe Saldana]] as Lilly\n*[[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Naomi Cozier\n*[[Glynn Turman]] as Chief Detective Duncan\n*[[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]] as Lieutenant Carver\n*[[Johnathon Schaech]] as Scott\n*[[Gaius Charles]] as Max\n*[[Gideon Emery]] as Sergei\n*[[Zulay Henao]] as Monica Hatcher\n*[[Nick Turturro]] as Franco Dalia\n*[[Andrew Fiscella]] as Security Chief\n*[[Gino Anthony Pesi]] as Paulie Jr.\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Takers'' received generally negative reviews from critics.

Ponni (Radha) used to hear him singing at the temple and falls in love with him. However, Ponni's mother Vadivukarasai wanted her to marry Radharavi, her relation who had come from  Singapore. Ponni is not willing to marry Radharavi.\n\nPonni performs all of Sakthi's chores without his knowledge. As Sakthi is blind, he is unable to see Ponni, but he can hear Ponni's anklets (an ornament which bharathanatiyam dancers wore on their legs). Once when Sakthi makes a floral offering to the Ambal, they fall on Ponni. From that incident Ponni  thinks that Sakthi is her spouse and breaks to him the news and Sakthi responds positively to the suggestion.\n\nDue to illness, Ponni does not meet Sakthi for three days. When Sakthi comes to know that she is ill, he goes to her house to see her. Her mother discreetly enquires about Sakthi. Ponni says that he is an astrologer and that he is blind. Ponni's  mother informs her worker to give him food as he looked like a beggar. After she leaves, Ponni apologizes to Sakthi for her mother's behaviour and when both talk, Nayanam (Goundamani) hears it and informs Radharavi. Immediately, Radharavi's family goes to Ponni's home for fixing the marriage. But in the engagement, Ponni says that she doesn't like him.\n\nAfter getting frustrated with Ponni's decision, Radharavi's men put Sakthi inside a haystack and set fire to it. Ponni finds him and rescues him, and later they elope together. Both are starving and Ponni wants Sakthi to sing songs for money for their living. While considering Ponni's acclaim, she was kidnapped by some people who smoke marijuana. They tied the hands and legs of Ponni. Meanwhile, Nayanam finds her and takes her back to her home. She marries Janagaraj who is a Chettiyar and Dharamakatha (a person managing temple activities) for a famous temple.\n\nSakthi was adopted by a famous singer who arranges eye operation for him and he gets back his vision. He became a famous singer and Janagaraj arranges a temple function and invite Sakthi to sing in that function. Sakthi always thinks of Ponni and searches for her in all the functions where he sang. Sakthi went to Janagaraj's home to stay. Ponni is so stunned after seeing him that she drops his Aarthi plate.\n\nSakthi was too much depressed after Ponni left him. Hearing the love story of Sakthi and Ponni, Janagaraj felt very sad for Sakthi and wants to join him with his lover,  without knowing the real truth that his wife is the lover of Sakthi. Ponni too couldn't say to Sakthi that she is Ponni and she is married. Ponni comes to know that this is the last song Sakthi sings as he won't sing any more songs.\n\nSakthi sings his last song, during the end of the song Ponni wakes up from her seat and walks towards Sakthi in the function. From her salangi sound, Sakthi finds out that she is Ponni. Heavy rain breaks down and all the people run away. But Sakthi continues to sing for which Ponni dance in rain. Ponni knowingly hits pillars of the temples while dancing and dies. After seeing her die, Sakthi touches the Salangai of Ponni, praises it and dies at her feet.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music for the film was composed by [[Ilaiyaraaja]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raaga.com/channels/tamil/moviedetail.asp?mid=T0000072|title=Kadhal Oviyam Songs|accessdate=2013-10-08|publisher=raaga}}</ref> Velli chalangaigal song is in chandrakauns raaga, Naadham En song is set to raaga Abheri.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/of-love-and-longing/article5329771.ece</ref><ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/a-ragas-journey-aspects-of-abheri/article2325286.ece</ref> The song \"Sangeetha Jaathi\" is based on Revathi, Poojaikkaaga vaazhum in Malayamaarudham, Poovil vandu koodum in Mohanam and \"Amma Azhage\" in Malahari raga.<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/mystical-revathi/article4418462.ece</ref>\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''No.''' || '''Song''' || '''Singers''' ||'''Lyrics'''\n|-\n| 1 || \"Amma Azhage\" || [[S.

Both Christianity and Islam incorporated significant charitable elements from their very beginnings<ref>Note for example Acts 2:44-45: \"And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\" ''Zak\u0101t'' (charity) ranks as one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]].</ref> and ''d\u0101na'' (alms-giving) has a long tradition in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Charities provided education, health, housing and even prisons. Almshouses were established throughout [[Europe]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] to provide a place of residence for poor, old and distressed people; [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] of England (reigned 924-939) founded the first recorded almshouse in [[York]] in the 10th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.almshouses.org/history/historical-summary/ |title= The Almshouse Association: A Historical Summary |access-date= 2013-10-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130825175919/http://www.almshouses.org/history/historical-summary/ |archive-date= 2013-08-25 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment charity===\n[[File:Foundling Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Foundling Hospital. The building has been demolished.]]\nIn the [[Enlightenment era]] charitable and [[philanthropy|philanthropic activity]] among [[voluntary association]]s and rich benefactors became a widespread cultural practice. Societies, [[gentleman's club]]s, and [[Mutual organization|mutual associations]] began to flourish in [[England]], and the upper-classes increasingly adopted a philanthropic attitude toward the disadvantaged. In England this new social activism was channeled into the establishment of charitable organizations; these proliferated from the middle of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.londonlives.org/static/AssociationalCharities.jsp |title= Associational Charities | quote = Through the middle decades of the eighteenth century a slew of new-style charities were created. They were directed at specific social problems (foundling children, prostitutes, venereal disease), funded by subscription, dependent on public support and organised as associations of the living.}}</ref>\n\nThis emerging upper-class fashion for benevolence resulted in the incorporation of the first charitable organizations. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Thomas Coram]], appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of  [[London]], set up the [[Foundling Hospital]] in 1741 to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields, [[Bloomsbury]]. This, the first such charity in the world,<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.thedorsetpage.com/people/thomas_coram.htm|title= Thomas Coram (1688-1751)|access-date= 2013-10-09|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161225110032/http://www.thedorsetpage.com/people/thomas_coram.htm|archive-date= 2016-12-25|url-status= dead}}</ref> served as the precedent for incorporated associational charities in general.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.victorianweb.org/history/orphanages/coram1.html|title= Captain Coram and the Foundling Hospital | quote = The result was the first children's charity in the country, and one that 'set the pattern for incorporated associational charities' in general (McClure 248).}}</ref>\n\n[[Jonas Hanway]], another notable philanthropist of the Enlightenment era, established [[The Marine Society]] in 1756 as the first seafarer's charity, in a bid to aid the recruitment of men to the [[Royal Navy|navy]].<ref>[[N. A. M. Rodger]], ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649-1815'' (New York: W.W. Norton & Company: 2004), 313.</ref> By 1763 the Society had recruited over 10,000 men; an [[Act of Parliament]] incorporated it in 1772. Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the [[Magdalen Hospital]] to rehabilitate [[prostitute]]s. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held{{by whom|date=September 2018}} in high social regard - some charities received state recognition in the form of the [[royal charter]].\n\nCharities also began to adopt campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that eventually succeeded at the turn of the 19th century in ending the [[slave trade]] throughout the [[British Empire]] and within its considerable sphere of influence. (This process was however a lengthy one, which finally concluded when Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962.)\n\nThe Enlightenment also saw growing philosophical debate between those who championed state intervention and those who believed that [[private charities]] should provide welfare. The Reverend [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766-1834), the political economist, criticized [[poor relief]] for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector.<ref>{{cite book |author= T. R.

The [[Labourer's Friend Society]], chaired by [[Lord Shaftesbury]] in the United Kingdom in 1830, aimed to improve working-class conditions. It promoted, for example, the allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] movement. In 1844 it became the first [[Model Dwellings Company]] - one of a group of organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first [[housing association]]s, a philanthropic endeavour that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century brought about by the growth of the [[middle class]]. Later associations included the [[Peabody Trust]] (originating in 1862) and the [[Guinness Trust]] (founded in 1890). The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given{{by whom|date=September 2018}} the label \"five per cent philanthropy\".<ref name=Tarn>Tarn, J.N. (1973) Five Per Cent Philanthropy. London: CUP</ref>\n\n[[File:Carnegie-1903.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]]'s philanthropy. ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine cartoon by [[Louis Dalrymple]], 1903.]]\nThere was strong growth in municipal charities. The Brougham Commission led on to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which reorganized multiple local charities by incorporating them into single entities under supervision from [[local government]].\n\nCharities at the time, including the [[Charity Organization Society]] (established in 1869) tended to discriminate between the \"deserving poor\" who would be provided with suitable relief and the \"underserving\" or \"improvident poor\" who were regarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as the cause of their own woes through their idleness. Charities tended to oppose the provision of welfare by the state, due to the perceived [[moral hazard|demoralizing effect]]. Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period, there was still significant government involvement in the shape of statutory regulation and even limited funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com/|title=st george-in-the-east - St George-in-the-East PCC - Charity Number 1133761|website=stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Philanthropy]] became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America. [[Octavia Hill]] (1838-1912) and [[John Ruskin]] (1819-1900) were an important force behind the development of [[social housing]], and [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835-1919) exemplified the large-scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America.

In 2002, the federal government established an inquiry into the definition of a charity. The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity, based on the principles developed through case law. This resulted in the ''Charities Bill 2003'', which included limitations on involvement of charities in political campaigning, which many charities saw as an unwelcome departure from the case law. The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill. As a result of widespread criticism from charities, the government abandoned the bill.\n\nThe government then introduced what became the ''Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004'', which did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose, but merely sought to clarify that certain purposes were charitable, whose charitable status had been subject to legal doubts. These purposes included childcare, self-help groups, and closed/contemplative religious orders.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| title=Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004 (Bills Digest, no. 164, 2003-04)| publisher=Department of Parliamentary Services| location=Australia| accessdate=2009-07-25| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329054436/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| archivedate=2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nTo publicly raise funds, a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds.

Pemsel'' (1891), Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act 2006.\n# the relief of [[poverty]],\n# the advancement of [[education]],\n# the advancement of [[religion]], and\n# other purposes considered beneficial to the community.\n\nCharities in England and Wales \u2013 such as Age UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ([[RSPB]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/|title=The RSPB Wildlife Charity: Nature Reserves & Wildlife Conservation|website=The RSPB|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> and the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals ([[RSPCA]]) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk|title=Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals - RSPCA|author=|date=|website=RSPCA.org.uk|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> \u2013 must comply with the 2011 Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising.\n\n=====Structures=====\n{{As of|2011}}, there are a number of types of legal structure for a charity in England and Wales.\n* Unincorporated association\n* Trust\n* Company limited by guarantee\n* Another incorporation, such as by royal charter\n* [[Charitable incorporated organization]]\n\nThe [[unincorporated association]] is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Seniors Network - Unincorporated Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014307/http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm |archivedate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref> This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose. An unincorporated association will normally have as its governing document a constitution or set of rules, which will deal with such matters as the appointment of office bearers, and the rules governing membership. The organization is not though a separate legal entity, so it cannot start legal action, it cannot borrow money, and it cannot enter into contracts in its own name. Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=NCVO - Legal structures for voluntary organizations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206100622/http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107%2F |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Trust law|trust]] is essentially a relationship among three parties: the donor of some assets, the trustees who hold the assets, and the beneficiaries (those people who are eligible to benefit from the charity). When the trust has charitable purposes, and is a charity, the trust is known as a charitable trust. The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust, which comes into operation once it is signed by all the trustees. The main disadvantage of a trust is that, as with an unincorporated association, it does not have a separate legal entity and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts. The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability.\n\nA company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where the liability of members is limited. A guarantee company does not have a share capital, but instead has members who are guarantors instead of shareholders. In the event of the company being wound up, the members agree to pay a nominal sum which can be as little as \u00a31. A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where it is desirable for the trustees to have the protection of limited liability. Also, the charity has legal personality, and so can enter into contracts, such as employment contracts in its own name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Guarantee Company - Not for Profit Companies - Charities |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915081559/http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA small number of charities are incorporated by [[royal charter]], a document which creates a corporation with legal personality (or, in some instances, transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter). The charter must be approved by the [[Privy Council]] before receiving royal assent. Although the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted, generally a royal charter will offer a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts.\n\nThe Charities Act 2006 legislated for a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities, the [[charitable incorporated organization]], with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company. Becoming a CIO was only made possible in 2013, with staggered introduction dates, with the charities with highest turnover eligible first.\n\nThe word ''foundation'' is not generally used in England and Wales. Occasionally, a charity will use the word as part of its name, e.g. [[British Heart Foundation]], but this has no legal significance and does not provide any information about either the work of the charity or how it is legally structured. The structure of the organization will be one of the types of structure described above.\n\n=====Registration=====\nCharitable organizations that have an income of more than \u00a35,000, and for whom the law of England and Wales applies, must register with the [[Charity Commission|Charity Commission for England and Wales]], unless they are an \"exempt\" or \"excepted\" charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-charities-cc23|title=Exempt charities (CC23)|work=www.gov.uk |date = 1 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excepted-charities|title=Excepted charities|work=www.gov.uk|date = 11 June 2014}}</ref> For companies, the law of England and Wales will normally apply if the company itself is registered in England and Wales.

It can, however, register as a charity with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] for tax purposes only.  With the rise in mandatory registration level, to \u00a35,000 by The Charities Act 2006, smaller charities can be reliant upon HMRC recognition to evidence their charitable purpose and confirm their not-for-profit principles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/tax/recognition.htm|title=Charities and tax|work=hmrc.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nSome charities which are called [[Exempt charity|exempt charities]] are not required to register with the Charity Commission and are not subject to any of the Charity Commission's supervisory powers. These charities include most universities and national museums and some other educational institutions.

These include reliefs and exemptions in relation to income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and value added tax.  These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a [[tax avoidance]] technique rather than because they offer a genuine charitable good.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|title=Labour could strip private schools of charitable status, says Stephen Twigg|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/19/twigg-private-schools-lose-charitable-status|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], a charitable organization is an organization operated for purposes that are beneficial to the [[public interest]].<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/> There are different types of charitable organizations. Every U.S. and foreign charity that qualifies as [[tax-exempt]] under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] is considered a \"[[private foundation]]\" ''unless'' it demonstrates to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] that it falls into another category. Generally, any organization that is not a private foundation (i.e.,&nbsp;it qualifies as something else) is usually a public charity as described in Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.<ref name=fdncenFAQ>FoundationCenter.org, [http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/pfandpc.html What is the difference between a private foundation and a public charity?], accessed 2009-06-20</ref>\n\nIn addition, a private foundation usually derives its principal funding from an individual, family, corporation, or some other single source and is more often than not a [[grantmaker]] and does not solicit funds from the public. In contrast, a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] or public charity generally receives grants from individuals, government, and private foundations, and while some public charities engage in [[grantmaking]] activities, most conduct direct service or other tax-exempt activities. Foundations that are generally grantmakers (i.e. they use their [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to make grants to other organizations, which in turn carry out the goals of the foundation indirectly) are usually called \"grantmaker\" or \"non-operating\" foundations.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe requirements and procedures for forming charitable organizations vary from state to state, as do the registration and filing requirements for charitable organizations that conduct charitable activities, solicit charitable contributions, or hire professional fundraisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasconet.org |title=NASCO National Association of State Charity Officials|access-date=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/authority/attorney-general-charities.php |title=U.S. List of Charitable Solicitation Authorities by State |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref> In practice, the detailed definition of \"charitable organization\" is determined by the requirements of state law where the charitable organization operates, and the requirements for federal tax relief by the IRS.\n\nResources exist to provide information, even rankings, of US charities.<ref>Adriene Hill, \"[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/worst-charities-get-information-you-make-donation The worst charities: Get information before you make a donation]\", ''Marketplace'', [[NPR]], June 14, 2013</ref>\n\n====Federal tax relief====\nFederal tax law provides tax benefits to nonprofit organizations recognized as exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The benefits of 501(c)(3) status include exemption from federal income tax as well as eligibility to receive tax deductible charitable contributions. To qualify for 501(c)(3) status most organizations must apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf |title=Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status: Publication P4220|accessdate=|publisher = IRS|date = March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeveral requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain 501(c)(3) status. These include the organization being organized as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association, and the organization's organizing document (such as the articles of incorporation, trust documents, or articles of association) must limit its purposes to being charitable, and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes. The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state or federal office, and must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/>  Most tax exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports ([[IRS Form 990]]) at the state and federal level. A tax exempt organization's 990 and some other forms are required to be made available to public scrutiny.\n\nThe types of charitable organization that are considered by the IRS to be organized for the public benefit include those that are organized for:\n* Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged\n* Advancement of religion\n* Advancement of education or science\n* Construction or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works\n* Lessening the burdens of government\n* Lessening of neighborhood tensions\n* Elimination of prejudice and discrimination\n* Defense of human and civil rights secured by law\n* Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\">\"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf Publication 557: Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization]\".

Both Christianity and Islam incorporated significant charitable elements from their very beginnings<ref>Note for example Acts 2:44-45: \"And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\" ''Zak\u0101t'' (charity) ranks as one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]].</ref> and ''d\u0101na'' (alms-giving) has a long tradition in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Charities provided education, health, housing and even prisons. Almshouses were established throughout [[Europe]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] to provide a place of residence for poor, old and distressed people; [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] of England (reigned 924-939) founded the first recorded almshouse in [[York]] in the 10th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.almshouses.org/history/historical-summary/ |title= The Almshouse Association: A Historical Summary |access-date= 2013-10-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130825175919/http://www.almshouses.org/history/historical-summary/ |archive-date= 2013-08-25 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment charity===\n[[File:Foundling Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Foundling Hospital.

Societies, [[gentleman's club]]s, and [[Mutual organization|mutual associations]] began to flourish in [[England]], and the upper-classes increasingly adopted a philanthropic attitude toward the disadvantaged. In England this new social activism was channeled into the establishment of charitable organizations; these proliferated from the middle of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.londonlives.org/static/AssociationalCharities.jsp |title= Associational Charities | quote = Through the middle decades of the eighteenth century a slew of new-style charities were created.

[[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Thomas Coram]], appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of  [[London]], set up the [[Foundling Hospital]] in 1741 to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields, [[Bloomsbury]].

Norton & Company: 2004), 313.</ref> By 1763 the Society had recruited over 10,000 men; an [[Act of Parliament]] incorporated it in 1772. Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the [[Magdalen Hospital]] to rehabilitate [[prostitute]]s. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held{{by whom|date=September 2018}} in high social regard - some charities received state recognition in the form of the [[royal charter]].\n\nCharities also began to adopt campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that eventually succeeded at the turn of the 19th century in ending the [[slave trade]] throughout the [[British Empire]] and within its considerable sphere of influence. (This process was however a lengthy one, which finally concluded when Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962.)\n\nThe Enlightenment also saw growing philosophical debate between those who championed state intervention and those who believed that [[private charities]] should provide welfare. The Reverend [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766-1834), the political economist, criticized [[poor relief]] for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector.<ref>{{cite book |author= T.

The [[Labourer's Friend Society]], chaired by [[Lord Shaftesbury]] in the United Kingdom in 1830, aimed to improve working-class conditions. It promoted, for example, the allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] movement. In 1844 it became the first [[Model Dwellings Company]] - one of a group of organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first [[housing association]]s, a philanthropic endeavour that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century brought about by the growth of the [[middle class]]. Later associations included the [[Peabody Trust]] (originating in 1862) and the [[Guinness Trust]] (founded in 1890). The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given{{by whom|date=September 2018}} the label \"five per cent philanthropy\".<ref name=Tarn>Tarn, J.N.

The Brougham Commission led on to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which reorganized multiple local charities by incorporating them into single entities under supervision from [[local government]].\n\nCharities at the time, including the [[Charity Organization Society]] (established in 1869) tended to discriminate between the \"deserving poor\" who would be provided with suitable relief and the \"underserving\" or \"improvident poor\" who were regarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as the cause of their own woes through their idleness. Charities tended to oppose the provision of welfare by the state, due to the perceived [[moral hazard|demoralizing effect]]. Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period, there was still significant government involvement in the shape of statutory regulation and even limited funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com/|title=st george-in-the-east - St George-in-the-East PCC - Charity Number 1133761|website=stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Philanthropy]] became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America. [[Octavia Hill]] (1838-1912) and [[John Ruskin]] (1819-1900) were an important force behind the development of [[social housing]], and [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835-1919) exemplified the large-scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America.

In 2002, the federal government established an inquiry into the definition of a charity. The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity, based on the principles developed through case law. This resulted in the ''Charities Bill 2003'', which included limitations on involvement of charities in political campaigning, which many charities saw as an unwelcome departure from the case law. The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill. As a result of widespread criticism from charities, the government abandoned the bill.\n\nThe government then introduced what became the ''Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004'', which did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose, but merely sought to clarify that certain purposes were charitable, whose charitable status had been subject to legal doubts. These purposes included childcare, self-help groups, and closed/contemplative religious orders.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| title=Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004 (Bills Digest, no. 164, 2003-04)| publisher=Department of Parliamentary Services| location=Australia| accessdate=2009-07-25| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329054436/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| archivedate=2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nTo publicly raise funds, a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds.

In ''Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel'' (1891), Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act 2006.\n# the relief of [[poverty]],\n# the advancement of [[education]],\n# the advancement of [[religion]], and\n# other purposes considered beneficial to the community.\n\nCharities in England and Wales \u2013 such as Age UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ([[RSPB]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/|title=The RSPB Wildlife Charity: Nature Reserves & Wildlife Conservation|website=The RSPB|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> and the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals ([[RSPCA]]) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk|title=Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals - RSPCA|author=|date=|website=RSPCA.org.uk|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> \u2013 must comply with the 2011 Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising.\n\n=====Structures=====\n{{As of|2011}}, there are a number of types of legal structure for a charity in England and Wales.\n* Unincorporated association\n* Trust\n* Company limited by guarantee\n* Another incorporation, such as by royal charter\n* [[Charitable incorporated organization]]\n\nThe [[unincorporated association]] is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Seniors Network - Unincorporated Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014307/http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm |archivedate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref> This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose. An unincorporated association will normally have as its governing document a constitution or set of rules, which will deal with such matters as the appointment of office bearers, and the rules governing membership. The organization is not though a separate legal entity, so it cannot start legal action, it cannot borrow money, and it cannot enter into contracts in its own name. Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=NCVO - Legal structures for voluntary organizations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206100622/http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107%2F |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Trust law|trust]] is essentially a relationship among three parties: the donor of some assets, the trustees who hold the assets, and the beneficiaries (those people who are eligible to benefit from the charity). When the trust has charitable purposes, and is a charity, the trust is known as a charitable trust. The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust, which comes into operation once it is signed by all the trustees. The main disadvantage of a trust is that, as with an unincorporated association, it does not have a separate legal entity and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts. The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability.\n\nA company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where the liability of members is limited. A guarantee company does not have a share capital, but instead has members who are guarantors instead of shareholders. In the event of the company being wound up, the members agree to pay a nominal sum which can be as little as \u00a31. A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where it is desirable for the trustees to have the protection of limited liability. Also, the charity has legal personality, and so can enter into contracts, such as employment contracts in its own name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Guarantee Company - Not for Profit Companies - Charities |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915081559/http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA small number of charities are incorporated by [[royal charter]], a document which creates a corporation with legal personality (or, in some instances, transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter). The charter must be approved by the [[Privy Council]] before receiving royal assent. Although the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted, generally a royal charter will offer a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts.\n\nThe Charities Act 2006 legislated for a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities, the [[charitable incorporated organization]], with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company. Becoming a CIO was only made possible in 2013, with staggered introduction dates, with the charities with highest turnover eligible first.\n\nThe word ''foundation'' is not generally used in England and Wales. Occasionally, a charity will use the word as part of its name, e.g. [[British Heart Foundation]], but this has no legal significance and does not provide any information about either the work of the charity or how it is legally structured. The structure of the organization will be one of the types of structure described above.\n\n=====Registration=====\nCharitable organizations that have an income of more than \u00a35,000, and for whom the law of England and Wales applies, must register with the [[Charity Commission|Charity Commission for England and Wales]], unless they are an \"exempt\" or \"excepted\" charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-charities-cc23|title=Exempt charities (CC23)|work=www.gov.uk |date = 1 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excepted-charities|title=Excepted charities|work=www.gov.uk|date = 11 June 2014}}</ref> For companies, the law of England and Wales will normally apply if the company itself is registered in England and Wales.

To qualify for 501(c)(3) status most organizations must apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf |title=Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status: Publication P4220|accessdate=|publisher = IRS|date = March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeveral requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain 501(c)(3) status. These include the organization being organized as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association, and the organization's organizing document (such as the articles of incorporation, trust documents, or articles of association) must limit its purposes to being charitable, and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes. The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state or federal office, and must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/>  Most tax exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports ([[IRS Form 990]]) at the state and federal level. A tax exempt organization's 990 and some other forms are required to be made available to public scrutiny.\n\nThe types of charitable organization that are considered by the IRS to be organized for the public benefit include those that are organized for:\n* Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged\n* Advancement of religion\n* Advancement of education or science\n* Construction or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works\n* Lessening the burdens of government\n* Lessening of neighborhood tensions\n* Elimination of prejudice and discrimination\n* Defense of human and civil rights secured by law\n* Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\">\"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf Publication 557: Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization]\". ''Internal Revenue Service''.

Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies [[Yucat\u00e1n]], within the middle of the large supercontinent of [[Pangea]]. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the [[Marathon Uplift]] in West [[Texas]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]], and to [[Alabama]] where it linked directly to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late [[Cretaceous]] times by the formation of the [[Mississippi Embayment]].<ref name=\"VanArsdale(2009)\">Van Arsdale, R. B.

First, there was a Late Triassic-Early [[Jurassic]] phase of rifting during which [[rift valley]]s formed and filled with continental [[red beds]]. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical {{convert|40|km|adj=on|lk=on|sp=us}} thickness of normal continental crust. It was at this time that rifting first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the opening basin to create the Gulf of Mexico as an enclosed marginal sea. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of [[Louann Salt]] and associated [[anhydrite]] [[evaporite]]s. During the Late Jurassic, continued rifting widened the Gulf of Mexico and progressed to the point that [[sea-floor spreading]] and formation of [[oceanic crust]] occurred. At this point, sufficient circulation with the Atlantic Ocean was established that the deposition of Louann Salt ceased.<ref name=\"Salvador(1991)\"/><ref name=\"SternOther(2010)\"/><ref name=\"Buffler(1991)\">Buffler, R.

The subsidence was the result of a combination of crustal stretching, cooling, and loading. Initially, the combination of crustal stretching and cooling caused about {{convert|5|\u2013|7|km|abbr=on}} of tectonic subsidence of the central thin transitional and oceanic crust.

Instead, Columbus sailed into the Caribbean around Cuba and [[Hispaniola]]. The first European exploration of the Gulf of Mexico was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1497. He followed the coastal land mass of [[Central America]] before returning to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Florida between [[Florida]] and Cuba. In his letters, Vespucci described this trip, and once [[Juan de la Cosa]] returned to Spain, a [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|famous world map]], depicting Cuba as an island, was produced.\n\nIn 1506, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba, receiving a large estate of land and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves for his effort. In 1510, he accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization.\n\nIn 1517, [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] discovered the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. This was the first [[European ethnic groups|European]] encounter with [[Mesoamerican civilizations|an advanced civilization]] in the [[Americas]], with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the [[Old World]]; they also had reason to expect that this new land would have [[gold]]. All of this encouraged two further expeditions, the first in 1518 under the command of [[Juan de Grijalva]], and the second in 1519 under the command of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the [[Conquest of Mexico]]. Hern\u00e1ndez did not live to see the continuation of his work: he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage, and disappointed in the knowledge that [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1523, [[\u00c1ngel de Villafa\u00f1e]] sailed toward [[Mexico City]] but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of [[Padre Island]], Texas, in 1554. When word of the disaster reached Mexico City, the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent Villafa\u00f1e marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels. Villafa\u00f1e traveled to P\u00e1nuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site, which had already been visited from that community. He arrived in time to greet Garc\u00eda de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado), commander of the salvage operation, when Alvarado arrived by sea on July 22, 1554. The team labored until September 12 to salvage the Padre Island treasure. This loss, in combination with other ship disasters around the Gulf of Mexico, gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern Gulf Coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways. As a result, the expedition of [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] was sent and landed at [[Pensacola Bay]] on August 15, 1559.\n\nOn December 11, 1526, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] granted [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States, known as the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]]. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each, and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast. On April 7, 1528, they spotted land north of what is now [[Tampa Bay]]. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot Miruelo knew of. Sometime during these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast, but nothing else is known of it.\n\nIn 1697, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] sailed for France and was chosen by the Minister of Marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and to colonize [[Louisiana]] which the English coveted. Iberville's fleet sailed from Brest on October 24, 1698. On January 25, 1699, Iberville reached Santa Rosa Island in front of [[Pensacola]] founded by the Spanish; he sailed from there to [[Mobile Bay]] and explored Massacre Island, later renamed [[Dauphin Island]]. He cast anchor between [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] and [[Ship Island]]; and on February 13, 1699, he went to the mainland, Biloxi, with his brother [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]].<ref name=\"Kevin_Knight\">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07614b.htm|title = Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville|publisher = newadvent.org| accessdate = May 8, 2009 | last=Kevin Knight |quote=}}</ref> On May 1, 1699, he completed a fort on the north-east side of the Bay of Biloxi, a little to the rear of what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]].

A few days later, on May 4, Pierre Le Moyne sailed for France leaving his teenage brother, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, as second in command to the French commandant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Shipwrecks==\nA ship now called the ''Mardi Gras'' sank around the early 19th century about {{convert|35|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of Louisiana in {{convert|4000|ft|m}} of water. She is believed to have been a [[privateer]] or trader. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]].

After the attack she was under escort by USS ''PC-566'', captained by Lieutenant Commander Herbert G. Claudius, en route to [[New Orleans]]. ''PC-566'' began dropping [[depth charge]]s on a [[sonar]] contact, sinking ''U-166''. The badly damaged ''Robert E.

The Mexican portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles (2,805&nbsp;km). On its southeast quadrant the Gulf is bordered by Cuba. It supports major American, Mexican and Cuban fishing industries. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucat\u00e1n and Florida receive cooler, [[nutrient]]-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as [[upwelling]], which stimulates plankton growth in the [[euphotic zone]]. This attracts fish, shrimp, and squid.<ref name=\"tshaonline\">{{cite web | url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rrg07 | title=Gulf of Mexico | work=Handbook of Texas Online | publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=June 26, 2010| date=2010-06-15 }}</ref> [[River]] drainage and atmospheric fallout from industrial coastal cities also provide nutrients to the coastal zone.\n\nThe [[Gulf Stream]], a warm Atlantic Ocean current and one of the strongest [[ocean current]]s known, originates in the gulf, as a continuation of the [[Caribbean Current]]-Yucat\u00e1n Current-[[Loop Current]] system. Other circulation features include the anticyclonic [[gyre]]s which are shed by the Loop Current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate, and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the Bay of Campeche. The Bay of Campeche in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico.  Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the Mississippi River and Rio Grande in the northern gulf, and the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] rivers in the southern gulf. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is an excellent example of a [[passive margin]]. The [[continental shelf]] is quite wide at most points along the coast, most notably at the Florida and Yucat\u00e1n Peninsulas. The shelf is exploited for its [[petroleum|oil]] by means of offshore drilling rigs, most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the Bay of Campeche. Another important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]], [[amberjack]], [[tilefish]], [[swordfish]], and various [[grouper]], as well as [[shrimp]] and [[crabs]].  [[Oysters]] are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds. Other important industries along the coast include shipping, petrochemical processing and storage, military use, paper manufacture, and tourism.\n\nThe gulf's warm water temperature can feed powerful Atlantic [[hurricane]]s causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. In the Atlantic, a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake (warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation). However, the Gulf is shallower; when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |title=Warm Waters Provide Fuel for Potential Storms |publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=May 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001040517/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |archivedate=October 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Gulf is considered [[aseismic]]; however, mild tremors have been recorded throughout history (usually 5.0 or less on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]).

Before the Late Triassic, the area now occupied by the Gulf of Mexico consisted of dry land, which included continental crust that now underlies [[Yucat\u00e1n]], within the middle of the large supercontinent of [[Pangea]]. This land lay south of a continuous mountain range that extended from north-central Mexico, through the [[Marathon Uplift]] in West [[Texas]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]], and to [[Alabama]] where it linked directly to the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It was created by the collision of continental plates that formed Pangea. As interpreted by Roy Van Arsdale and Randel T. Cox, this mountain range was breached in Late [[Cretaceous]] times by the formation of the [[Mississippi Embayment]].<ref name=\"VanArsdale(2009)\">Van Arsdale, R. B.

First, there was a Late Triassic-Early [[Jurassic]] phase of rifting during which [[rift valley]]s formed and filled with continental [[red beds]]. Second, as rifting progressed through Early and Middle Jurassic time, continental crust was stretched and thinned. This thinning created a broad zone of transitional crust, which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting, and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust, which is half the typical {{convert|40|km|adj=on|lk=on|sp=us}} thickness of normal continental crust. It was at this time that rifting first created a connection to the Pacific Ocean across central Mexico and later eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. This flooded the opening basin to create the Gulf of Mexico as an enclosed marginal sea. While the Gulf of Mexico was a restricted basin, the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of [[Louann Salt]] and associated [[anhydrite]] [[evaporite]]s. During the Late Jurassic, continued rifting widened the Gulf of Mexico and progressed to the point that [[sea-floor spreading]] and formation of [[oceanic crust]] occurred. At this point, sufficient circulation with the Atlantic Ocean was established that the deposition of Louann Salt ceased.<ref name=\"Salvador(1991)\"/><ref name=\"SternOther(2010)\"/><ref name=\"Buffler(1991)\">Buffler, R.

Instead, Columbus sailed into the Caribbean around Cuba and [[Hispaniola]]. The first European exploration of the Gulf of Mexico was by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1497. He followed the coastal land mass of [[Central America]] before returning to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Florida between [[Florida]] and Cuba. In his letters, Vespucci described this trip, and once [[Juan de la Cosa]] returned to Spain, a [[Map of Juan de la Cosa|famous world map]], depicting Cuba as an island, was produced.\n\nIn 1506, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba, receiving a large estate of land and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves for his effort. In 1510, he accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. In 1518 Vel\u00e1zquez put him in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization.\n\nIn 1517, [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] discovered the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. This was the first [[European ethnic groups|European]] encounter with [[Mesoamerican civilizations|an advanced civilization]] in the [[Americas]], with solidly built buildings and a complex social organization which they recognized as being comparable to those of the [[Old World]]; they also had reason to expect that this new land would have [[gold]]. All of this encouraged two further expeditions, the first in 1518 under the command of [[Juan de Grijalva]], and the second in 1519 under the command of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, which led to the Spanish exploration, military invasion, and ultimately settlement and colonization known as the [[Conquest of Mexico]]. Hern\u00e1ndez did not live to see the continuation of his work: he died in 1517, the year of his expedition, as the result of the injuries and the extreme thirst suffered during the voyage, and disappointed in the knowledge that [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] had given precedence to Grijalva as the captain of the next expedition to Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1523, [[\u00c1ngel de Villafa\u00f1e]] sailed toward [[Mexico City]] but was shipwrecked en route along the coast of [[Padre Island]], Texas, in 1554. When word of the disaster reached Mexico City, the viceroy requested a rescue fleet and immediately sent Villafa\u00f1e marching overland to find the treasure-laden vessels. Villafa\u00f1e traveled to P\u00e1nuco and hired a ship to transport him to the site, which had already been visited from that community. He arrived in time to greet Garc\u00eda de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado), commander of the salvage operation, when Alvarado arrived by sea on July 22, 1554. The team labored until September 12 to salvage the Padre Island treasure. This loss, in combination with other ship disasters around the Gulf of Mexico, gave rise to a plan for establishing a settlement on the northern Gulf Coast to protect shipping and more quickly rescue castaways. As a result, the expedition of [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] was sent and landed at [[Pensacola Bay]] on August 15, 1559.\n\nOn December 11, 1526, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] granted [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] a license to claim what is now the Gulf Coast of the United States, known as the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]]. The contract gave him one year to gather an army, leave Spain, be large enough to found at least two towns of 100 people each, and garrison two more fortresses anywhere along the coast. On April 7, 1528, they spotted land north of what is now [[Tampa Bay]]. They turned south and traveled for two days looking for a great harbor the master pilot Miruelo knew of. Sometime during these two days, one of the five remaining ships was lost on the rugged coast, but nothing else is known of it.\n\nIn 1697, [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] sailed for France and was chosen by the Minister of Marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] and to colonize [[Louisiana]] which the English coveted. Iberville's fleet sailed from Brest on October 24, 1698. On January 25, 1699, Iberville reached Santa Rosa Island in front of [[Pensacola]] founded by the Spanish; he sailed from there to [[Mobile Bay]] and explored Massacre Island, later renamed [[Dauphin Island]]. He cast anchor between [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] and [[Ship Island]]; and on February 13, 1699, he went to the mainland, Biloxi, with his brother [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]].<ref name=\"Kevin_Knight\">{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07614b.htm|title = Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville|publisher = newadvent.org| accessdate = May 8, 2009 | last=Kevin Knight |quote=}}</ref> On May 1, 1699, he completed a fort on the north-east side of the Bay of Biloxi, a little to the rear of what is now [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]]. This fort was known as [[Fort Maurepas]] or Old Biloxi. A few days later, on May 4, Pierre Le Moyne sailed for France leaving his teenage brother, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, as second in command to the French commandant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Shipwrecks==\nA ship now called the ''Mardi Gras'' sank around the early 19th century about {{convert|35|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of Louisiana in {{convert|4000|ft|m}} of water. She is believed to have been a [[privateer]] or trader. The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&M University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now [[BOEM]]), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the [[Louisiana State Museum]].

After the attack she was under escort by USS ''PC-566'', captained by Lieutenant Commander Herbert G. Claudius, en route to [[New Orleans]]. ''PC-566'' began dropping [[depth charge]]s on a [[sonar]] contact, sinking ''U-166''. The badly damaged ''Robert E.

The Mexican portion of the Gulf coastline spans 1,743 miles (2,805&nbsp;km). On its southeast quadrant the Gulf is bordered by Cuba. It supports major American, Mexican and Cuban fishing industries. The outer margins of the wide continental shelves of Yucat\u00e1n and Florida receive cooler, [[nutrient]]-enriched waters from the deep by a process known as [[upwelling]], which stimulates plankton growth in the [[euphotic zone]]. This attracts fish, shrimp, and squid.<ref name=\"tshaonline\">{{cite web | url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rrg07 | title=Gulf of Mexico | work=Handbook of Texas Online | publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=June 26, 2010| date=2010-06-15 }}</ref> [[River]] drainage and atmospheric fallout from industrial coastal cities also provide nutrients to the coastal zone.\n\nThe [[Gulf Stream]], a warm Atlantic Ocean current and one of the strongest [[ocean current]]s known, originates in the gulf, as a continuation of the [[Caribbean Current]]-Yucat\u00e1n Current-[[Loop Current]] system. Other circulation features include the anticyclonic [[gyre]]s which are shed by the Loop Current and travel westward where they eventually dissipate, and a permanent cyclonic gyre in the Bay of Campeche. The Bay of Campeche in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico.  Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the Mississippi River and Rio Grande in the northern gulf, and the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]] and [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] rivers in the southern gulf. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is an excellent example of a [[passive margin]]. The [[continental shelf]] is quite wide at most points along the coast, most notably at the Florida and Yucat\u00e1n Peninsulas. The shelf is exploited for its [[petroleum|oil]] by means of offshore drilling rigs, most of which are situated in the western gulf and in the Bay of Campeche. Another important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include [[Lutjanus campechanus|red snapper]], [[amberjack]], [[tilefish]], [[swordfish]], and various [[grouper]], as well as [[shrimp]] and [[crabs]].  [[Oysters]] are also harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds. Other important industries along the coast include shipping, petrochemical processing and storage, military use, paper manufacture, and tourism.\n\nThe gulf's warm water temperature can feed powerful Atlantic [[hurricane]]s causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. In the Atlantic, a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake (warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation). However, the Gulf is shallower; when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |title=Warm Waters Provide Fuel for Potential Storms |publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=May 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001040517/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17038 |archivedate=October 1, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Gulf is considered [[aseismic]]; however, mild tremors have been recorded throughout history (usually 5.0 or less on the [[Richter magnitude scale]]).

At a time when discrimination was very severe especially for those exploring their identities, these clubs offered people a space to avoid those struggles. People focused on their dance and outdoing their peers and competitors rather than society's rejection of minority groups. The House of Melody was the first German voguing house. It brought together people passionate for voguing. They emphasized ignoring people's backgrounds and instead understanding everyone's shared belief in love for all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehouseofmelody.com/|title=the house of melody - HOME|website=thehouseofmelody.com|language=de|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref> These clubs were important for people who might have been looking for a place to escape the challenges that they faced on the streets or at home. The empowerment that was generated in these spaces transferred into contributing to a broader movement that would tend to the struggles of minorities in Germany.\n\nAlthough Madonna's song [[Vogue (Madonna song)|'Vogue']] brought popularity and awareness to the dance style, the pop singer still received criticism from those who believe she exploited and appropriated the ballroom culture. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chatzipapatheodoridis |first1=Constantine |title=Strike a Pose, Forever: The Legacy of Vogue and its Re-contextualization in Contemporary Camp Performances |journal=European Journal of American Studies |volume=11 |issue=3 |date=2017 |doi=10.4000/ejas.11771 }}</ref> [[Cultural appropriation]] involves the adoption of certain aspects of a minority or disadvantaged culture by a member of the majority culture without proper acknowledgement of the origin. <ref>{{cite web |title=cultural appropriation |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cultural-appropriation |website=Cambridge Dictionary}}</ref> The 1990 music video was choreographed by [[Jose Gutierrez Xtravaganza]] and [[Luis Camacho (dancer)]] of the [[House of Xtravaganza]] and featured [[Willi Ninja]] as a dancer.

At a time when discrimination was very severe especially for those exploring their identities, these clubs offered people a space to avoid those struggles. People focused on their dance and outdoing their peers and competitors rather than society's rejection of minority groups. The House of Melody was the first German voguing house. It brought together people passionate for voguing. They emphasized ignoring people's backgrounds and instead understanding everyone's shared belief in love for all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehouseofmelody.com/|title=the house of melody - HOME|website=thehouseofmelody.com|language=de|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref> These clubs were important for people who might have been looking for a place to escape the challenges that they faced on the streets or at home. The empowerment that was generated in these spaces transferred into contributing to a broader movement that would tend to the struggles of minorities in Germany.\n\nAlthough Madonna's song [[Vogue (Madonna song)|'Vogue']] brought popularity and awareness to the dance style, the pop singer still received criticism from those who believe she exploited and appropriated the ballroom culture. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chatzipapatheodoridis |first1=Constantine |title=Strike a Pose, Forever: The Legacy of Vogue and its Re-contextualization in Contemporary Camp Performances |journal=European Journal of American Studies |volume=11 |issue=3 |date=2017 |doi=10.4000/ejas.11771 }}</ref> [[Cultural appropriation]] involves the adoption of certain aspects of a minority or disadvantaged culture by a member of the majority culture without proper acknowledgement of the origin. <ref>{{cite web |title=cultural appropriation |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/cultural-appropriation |website=Cambridge Dictionary}}</ref> The 1990 music video was choreographed by [[Jose Gutierrez Xtravaganza]] and [[Luis Camacho (dancer)]] of the [[House of Xtravaganza]] and featured [[Willi Ninja]] as a dancer. However, all of the celebrities mentioned in the song are white, and Madonna herself is a white woman. Even though Madonna referenced the Harlem ballroom culture by including members of the community in the production of the video, critics still say that she erased the originating culture since she is the primary mainstream association with the style. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Goodman |first1=Elyssa |title=The Historic, Mainstream Appropriation of Ballroom Culture |url=https://www.them.us/story/ballroom-culture-rupaul-madonna-paris-is-burning |website=Them. |accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* \"[[Deep in Vogue]]\"\n* [[House of Aviance]]\n* [[House of Xtravaganza]]\n* [[LGBT culture in New York City]]\n* ''[[Pose (TV series)]]''\n* ''[[Strike a Pose]]''\n* [[Willi Ninja]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{African-American dance}}\n{{Ball culture|state=collapsed}}\n{{Street dance}}\n{{Portal bar|United States|LGBT}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vogue (Dance)}}\n[[Category:African-American dance]]\n[[Category:Ball culture]]\n[[Category:Ballroom dance]]\n[[Category:Ballroom dance competitions]]\n[[Category:Dances of the United States]]\n[[Category:LGBT culture in New York City]]\n[[Category:LGBT African Americans]]\n[[Category:LGBT dance]]\n[[Category:LGBT Hispanic and Latino American culture]]\n[[Category:New York City nightlife]]\n[[Category:Novelty and fad dances]]\n[[Category:Vogue (magazine)]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Latino\u2192Latino (demonym),Egyptian Hieroglyphs\u2192Egyptian hieroglyphs", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(dance)"}
