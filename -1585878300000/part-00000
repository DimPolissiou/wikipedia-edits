The [[canyon]] rim elevation is {{convert|6690|ft|m|abbr=on}}; the canyon's floor is 350&nbsp;ft lower. A {{convert|0.9|mi|km|abbr=on}} long loop trail descends {{convert|185|ft|m|abbr=on}} into the canyon passing 25 cliff dwelling rooms constructed by the [[Sinagua]], a pre-Columbian cultural group that lived in Walnut Canyon from about 1100 to 1250 CE. Other contemporary habitations of the Sinagua people are preserved in the nearby [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]] and [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]] national monuments.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Walnut canyon cliff dwellings.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cliff dwellings in Walnut Canyon]]\n[[File:Map of Walnut Canyon NM.png|thumb|left|200px|Click for larger version of map]]\n\nSinagua is Spanish for \"without water\", an acknowledgement that the [[Sinagua]] people were able to live in such a dry region.  By living in such a region the Sinagua became experts at conserving water and dealing with droughts.  The Sinagua were also believed to have been active traders whose activities and influence stretched to the Gulf of Mexico and even as far as Central America. The Sinagua, who inhabited the dwellings in Walnut Canyon, left mysteriously around 1250 CE.  It is thought that the Sinagua left because of fear of neighboring tribes or droughts, but it is not certain.  The Sinagua left over 80 cliff dwellings behind.  The Sinagua built their homes under limestone ledges, deep within the canyon, some time between 1125 and 1250 CE - taking advantage of the natural recesses in the limestone cliff walls which were eroded over millions of years by flowing water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walnut Canyon National Monument|url=http://www.arizona-gallery.com/info/walnutinfo.html|work=Arizona Gallery by Jacquie Lumb|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> The dwellings themselves were small, but large enough for the inhabitants to cook and sleep.  Most of the cliff dwelling rooms are situated near the loop trail, typically slightly above the trail and immediately outside the loop itself. A typical room might have been the dwelling of a single family, and might measure approximately two meters high by six meters long by three meters deep.  Because of the area's dry climate, the water present in the canyon was essential for its inhabitants over 700 years ago as it is for animal and plant life today.  The plant life is very diverse in Walnut Canyon, with more than 387 different plant species, including the Prickly Pear cactus and the Arizona Black Walnut.  The biodiversity of the area includes high concentrations of sensitive plant species that probably contributed to the decision made by prehistoric people to settle in the area.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/waca/naturescience/plants.htm \"Plants: Trees and Shrubs\"], United States National Park Service, 2006</ref>\n\nThere are other ruins in the {{convert|20|by|10|mi|km|0|adj=on}} area, but none are publicly accessible.

[[Crossbedding]] is present in the Coconino Sandstone.\n\nThe Walnut Canyon site contains [[Walnut Creek (Arizona)|Walnut Creek]], which carved a 600 foot deep canyon that flows east.  The creek joins into the Little Colorado River en route to the Grand Canyon.  The creek has also created a varied and abundant array of vegetation.  The shaded, north- facing walls are covered in fir and ponderosa pine trees.  The sunny, south facing slopes have agaves and several species of cactus including opuntia, echnocereus and cholla.  The floor of the canyon is home to several species of walnut trees, for which the canyon is named.\n\nThe rocks in the canyon walls are formed of three distinct layers - the  upper third of Walnut Canyon's walls contain [[Kaibab Limestone]] that varies in layers and hardness, where the cliff dwellings are found, which overlies steep, scrub covered slopes of the [[Toroweap Formation]], while the lowest third is the sheer-walled, cross-bedded [[Coconino Sandstone]].  Many layers of the limestone eroded, creating alcoves that the Sinagua Indians used as cave-dwellings.\n\nToday a variety of archeological and natural resources are preserved on approximately 3600 acres.\n\n== Climate ==\nNot all of Arizona is warm dry desert. At Walnut Canyon (6690'/2039m above sea level), has snow in winter, hot sun in summer with afternoon thunderstorms, and in the spring, strong gusty winds on the rim and/or in the canyon.  Even though the climate was and still is somewhat harsh, the Sinagua Indians that lived there were able to harvest maize, beans and squash.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Walnut Canyon N.M.

It was a small, single-engine, single-seat, low-wing [[monoplane]] of wooden construction, normally powered by a six-cylinder [[de Havilland Gipsy Six]] piston engine. During its racing career it set many records and was considered a significant, efficient design, one that eventually reached a top speed of 265&nbsp;mph (425&nbsp;km/h) on a modest 205&nbsp;hp (153&nbsp;kW) in its final 1939 form. During the second half of the 1930s, Mew Gulls were dominant in air-racing in the UK and consistently recorded the fastest times until the outbreak of war stopped all civilian flying in late 1939.\n\n==Design and development==\nWith the [[Percival Gull]] already making a name for itself as a racer, over several months in 1933\u20131934, Capt. [[Edgar Percival|Edgar W. Percival]] designed and built a single-seat racer derivative initially named the '''E1''' 'Mew Gull'. This was developed into the '''E2''', '''E2H''' and the '''E3H''' variants between 1934 and 1938. The sometimes-used designation \"P6\" is incorrect; this retrospective tag was created after Percival left the company and long after the Mew Gulls were built, thus no Mew Gulls were ever built as \"P6s\". With the exception of the sole E3H, ''G-AFAA'' \u2013 which was built after the company moved to Luton, all of the Mew gulls were built in the small factory at Gravesend. The E3H, whilst very strongly visually resembling the E2H, was in truth a totally new and different machine, with each element differing from its predecessor in some way. It was most certainly not a 'clipped-wing' version of the E2H as it has sometimes been described.\n\nStructurally, there was very little commonality of parts between the Gulls IV/ VI/ Vega Gull and the Mew Gull, other than a few minor components. All of the Gulls, however, did use a similar generic structure. Proprietary equipment such as engines, airscrews, spinners, instruments, undercarriage legs, wheels and tyres were generally common to all series. The Mew Gulls (apart from the E1 in its initial configuration) used a fixed, conventional oleomatic main [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] and a fully castoring tailskid. Small manually operated, split trailing-edge wing flaps were incorporated into the mainplanes, but were \"...singularly ineffective even when fully extended\".<ref>Ogilvy, David F. ''Motorsport, Vol.XXVIII, No. 4, April 1952.''.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was designed for handicapped air racing which gained huge popularity in the UK during the 1920s and especially 1930s \u2013 the so-called \"Golden Age\" of aviation. The [[King's Cup Race]], an annual handicapped air racing event developed to aid in the development of [[United Kingdom|British]] light aircraft, was considered to be the \"Blue-Riband\" event. Ultimately, Mew Gulls went on to win this event four times.\n\nThe prototype ''G-ACND'' first flew in March 1934 with a 165&nbsp;hp [[Napier Javelin]], but it was replaced with a more powerful and reliable 200&nbsp;hp Gipsy Six engine, fitted with a fixed-pitch airscrew, prior to its first race.\n\n==Type history==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe [[King's Cup Race|King's Cup]] was a handicap race dating back to 1922; each racing result was compared to the time that the committee decided each contestant should have completed the course. The greater the margin by which an entry beat its prescribed time, the better its chance of winning. Initially [[George V of England|King George V]] was to present a cup to the winner, and like the [[Schneider Trophy]], the same cup would be engraved and awarded to the new winner each year. After the first year's race it was decided that a new cup would be presented each year.\n\nPercival entered the King's Cup Race in July 1934, but failed to place. The original E1 was redesigned following an accident into the much-refined E2 configuration, with much of the design work completed by Arthur Bage. In July 1935, with a 180&nbsp;hp French [[R\u00e9gnier Motor Company|R\u00e9gnier]] installed, ''G-ACND'' competed in the [[Coupe Armand Esders]], a race of 1,046&nbsp;miles from Deauville, France to Cannes and back. The Mew Gull was flown by Count de Chateaubrun, the Percival representative in France, and averaged 188&nbsp;mph in the race. Immediately after, the original British de Havilland Gipsy Six was reinstalled. Guy de Chateaubrun subsequently became the only pilot to [[bail out]] of a Mew Gull, abandoning ''G-ACND'' because of fog.\n\nIn September 1935 Percival placed 1st in a {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} race, and in July 1936 he finished 4th in the King's Cup Race flying ''G-AEKL'', the third Mew Gull and first \"production\" E2H. Later in August, Percival finished 7th in the 174-mile race for the Folkestone Trophy.\n\nIn September 1936 ''G-AEKL'', having previously been Edgar Percival's private mount, was re-engined and modified to enter in the [[Schlesinger Race]]. The Schlesinger African Air Race was a race from England to South Africa (6,154&nbsp;miles), but G-AEKL was withdrawn ten days before the Schlesinger following a fatal taxiing accident at Liverpool [[Speke Airport]]. Two other E2H Mew Gulls were entered, both of which had been built at the same time to the same specification as the modified ''KL''. Both failed to finish the race to South Africa. In the 1937 King's Cup Race, the rebuilt and re-painted ''G-AEKL'' was 1st with Charles Gardner at the controls in his house-colours of dark blue with pale-blue lettering and trim (See Flight of the Mew Gull, p91.). He averaged 234&nbsp;mph over the 1,442-mile course. Percival flew his latest E3H \"Super\"-Mew ''G-AFAA'', the sixth and last Mew Gull built, to a third-place finish and still another E2H, ''G-AEXF'' was raced by [[Alex Henshaw]].\n\nThe 1938 King's Cup Race was a 1,012&nbsp;mile event and this time, Alex Henshaw's much modified E2H ''G-AEXF'' came in 1st at 236&nbsp;mph and Giles Guthrie in his red \"standard\" E2H ''G-AEKL'' placed 2nd. Edgar Percival flew a third Mew Gull, the E3H (''G-AFAA'') and finished 6th. Percival might easily have won, but as well as being made scratch-man by the Handicappers, he left the fine-tuning of his airscrew pitches until just before the race and his ground-crew were still tinkering with them as Alex Henshaw took off. At this time the Bracket-Type airscrew simply did not have the pitch-range to cope with the exceptionally wide speed range of the E3H (59\u2013265&nbsp;mph). An optimisation for either cruise or takeoff and climb would inevitably compromise the other.\n\nAlex Henshaw attempted to take the England \u2013 Cape Town Record in 1939, taking off on 5 February 1939 from [[Gravesend Airport]], landing at [[Wingfield Aerodrome]] at the Cape the next day, covering the 6,377&nbsp;miles course in 39&nbsp;hours and 25&nbsp;minutes, averaging 209.44&nbsp;mph while in the air. The return trip was just 11&nbsp;minutes longer. During all of Alex Henshaw's adventures in this aircraft, it was never damaged.\n[[File:Percival P.6 Mew Gull G-AEXF WVTN 16.05.53.jpg|thumb|right|Mew Gull ''G-AEXF'' wearing racing number ''97'' when competing in the 1953 UK National Air Races at [[Wolverhampton (Pendeford) airfield]] in May 1953]]\nHenshaw sold ''G-AEXF'' to Frenchman Victor Vermoral in late 1939. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the aircraft was stored in a hangar in France with several owners continuing to hide it from German authorities. In 1950, Hugh Scrope found and bought it, and with Doug Bianchi's help, refurbished the aircraft to fly it back home to England. After restoration, ''G-AEXF'' continued its racing career but it was damaged in a landing accident in August 1951 at Shoreham.  J.N. Somers, the next owner repaired it and raced ''G-AEXF'' again. A new owner, Ernest Crabtree, flew it last in the 1965 [[Manx Air Derby]]. By this time however, other owners had further altered this historic aircraft, resulting in lowered performance. Eventually, the derelict aircraft found its way into the hands of a poorly run museum, where it became damp, had its wings crudely sawn off, and many parts lost to souvenir hunters. In this state, Tom Storey and Martin Barraclough acquired the aircraft and rebuilt it during the late 1970s. Wishing to make the aircraft more practical to operate, a configuration closer to its original design was chosen, making ''G-AEXF'' look somewhat like an E2H/E3H hybrid, painted in the white and [[British Racing Green]] she wore when owned by Alex Henshaw in the 1930s. ''XF'' was again damaged at Redhill in late 1983, when an Auster taxied into it. The aircraft continued to be operated in the configuration as rebuilt by Storey and Barraclough until it was offered for sale.\n\nDesmond Penrose was the next owner, who based the machine at Old Warden. The aircraft was written-off two further times: one at the time of purchase and again a few years later. After the first of these rebuilds, the machine was re-configured to resemble its configuration for the 1939 Cape flight. G-AEXF was extensively rebuilt yet again for a third time and continued to operate from Old Warden for some time until sold-on.\n\nIn 2002, ''G-AEXF'' was sold to Rob Fleming and was operated by The Real Aeroplane Company at the Breighton Aerodrome, Yorkshire, UK. It was temporarily shipped over to the US to fly in a \"demonstration race\" at the 2003 [[National Championship Air Races]] at Reno, Nevada, the first Mew Gull to touch American soil. In 2012, ''G-AEXF'' was operating from Breighton,\n\n76 years after her original incarnation. In October 2013 ''G-AEXF'' was sold to the [[Shuttleworth Collection]] at Old Warden, Bedfordshire, UK, where it remains flying as part of the museum.\n\nA UK Registered replica of a Mew Gull, ''G-HEKL'', is now airworthy in the UK.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe Mew Gulls were a family of \"half-siblings,\" each tailored to the customer's demands.  Six were built:\n\n===G-ACND===\nThe prototype Mew Gull, designated '''Type E.1''' was fitted with a [[Napier Javelin]] engine, and first flew in March 1934. In October 1935, ''G-ACND'' was destroyed in a crash near [[Angoul\u00eame]] during the [[Coupe Michelin]].\n\n===G-ACND===\n[[File:Percival_Mew_Gull_photo_Le_Pontentiel_A\u00e9rien_Mondial_1936.jpg|thumb|Percival Mew Gull G-ACND photo from Le Pontentiel A\u00e9rien Mondial 1936]]\nThe '''Type E.2''', powered by a 200&nbsp;hp Gipsy Six, carried the same registration as its predecessor but was almost a complete re-design. ''G-ACND'' was temporarily fitted with a smaller 180&nbsp;hp Regnier engine to qualify for the [[Coupe Armand Esders]] of 1935.  With the Gipsy Six reinstated, the aircraft flew in a number of later races and won the [[Folkestone Trophy Race]].\n\n===G-AEKL===\n[[File:Replica Percival Mew Gull 'G-HEKL' (20332997744).jpg|thumb|''G-HEKL'' in 2015, a replica of the Percival Mew Gull ''G-AEKL''.]]\nThe '''E.2H'''. Fitted with a De Havilland Gipsy Six and flown by Edgar Percival in the King's Cup and [[Folkestone]] Trophy Races of 1936. Sold and re-engined with a Gipsy Six Series II, ''G-AEKL'' was entered in the [[Schlesinger Race]] along with''ZS-AHM'' and ''ZS-AHO''. However, the aircraft was damaged in a fatal accident at Liverpool Speke Airport that autumn, [[Tom Campbell Black]] being killed.  Rebuilt in 1937, ''G-AEKL'' won the Newcastle Race for its new owner. G-AEKL was rebuilt twice, was fitted with three different engines and had a total of six paint schemes. Subsequently, the aircraft passed through several hands before being destroyed by German bombs at Lympne early in the war.\n\n===ZS-AHM/G-AEXF===\n''The Golden City'', also an E2H, was built to the order of A.M. Miller for the Schlesinger Race and powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. Miller retired at the Belgrade checkpoint. Percival re-engined the aircraft with a Gipsy Six and sold it to [[Bill Humble]] who registered it in the UK as ''G-AEXF''. Humble never took delivery, instead selling it to Alex Henshaw, who soon won the 1937 Folkestone Trophy with ''G-AEXF''. For 1938, ''XF'' flew with a Gipsy Six R engine to win the Kings Cup. In February 1939, then powered by a Gipsy Six Series II and with revised equipment, it set a new mark for the out-and-home Cape class-record which stood until 2009. Although rebuilt many times and essentially a replica, ''G-AEXF'' powered by a Gipsy Queen II is owned and operated by [[The Shuttleworth Collection]], [[Old Warden]] and displays at airshows during the summer months.<ref>[http://www.shuttleworth.org/collection/mewgull/ The Shuttleworth Collection - Mew Gull] Retrieved 26 April 2017</ref>\n\nAJD Engineering (Ipswich, UK) who restored the original Mew Gull ''G-AEXF'' after its crash at Shuttleworth were commissioned by the late [[Alex Henshaw]] to manufacture a static replica Mew Gull, representing the Cape configuration of ''G-AEXF''. This aircraft is now complete and on initial display at the [[RAF Museum Hendon]].<ref>[http://www.hawker-restorations-ltd.co.uk/_images/_completed/mewgull/mewgull.html \"Static Mew Gull \u2013 Henshaw Rebuild.\"] ''hawker-restorations-ltd.co.uk''. Retrieved: 5 December 2009.</ref>\n\n===ZS-AHO/G-AEMO===\n''Baragwanath'', was another E2H powered by a Gipsy Six Series II engine, built to the order of S.S. \"Stan\" Halse for the Schlesinger Race. Due to bad visibility, Halse made a forced landing in a ploughed field in [[Southern Rhodesia]], where the aircraft flipped onto its back and was written off. At the time of the accident, Halse was well ahead of the rest of the field, so much so, that by the time Scott and Guthrie's winning Vega Gull arrived, most of the disappointed spectators had gone home.\n\n===G-AFAA===\nThe one-off '''Type E.3H''' (the so-called ''\"Super\"-Mew '') was Edgar Percival's personal mount. While looking very much the same as the E2H, this was actually a completely new design, powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. It first flew in 1937 and was raced by Percival in 1937\u20131939. On loan for propeller trials at Hatfield during the war, ''G-AFAA'' was written off in a landing accident by a de Havilland pilot. The remains of this aircraft were burned with those of ''G-ACND'' at a Percival Aircraft garden fete at Luton Airport immediately after the war.\n\n==Specifications (Type E.1)==\n{{aircraft specifications\n<!-- if you do not understand how to use this template, please ask at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft]] -->\n|plane or copter?=<!-- options: plane/copter -->plane\n|jet or prop?=<!-- options: jet/prop/both/neither -->prop\n|ref=British Civil Aircraft Since 1919<ref>Jackson, Aubrey J.

It was a small, single-engine, single-seat, low-wing [[monoplane]] of wooden construction, normally powered by a six-cylinder [[de Havilland Gipsy Six]] piston engine. During its racing career it set many records and was considered a significant, efficient design, one that eventually reached a top speed of 265&nbsp;mph (425&nbsp;km/h) on a modest 205&nbsp;hp (153&nbsp;kW) in its final 1939 form. A modern-day observer has characterised the Mew Gull as \"the Holy Grail of British air racing\".<ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} [http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2007/february-march/and_then_there_was_one.htm \"And Then there was One.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070514220547/http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2007/february-march/and_then_there_was_one.htm |date=14 May 2007 }} ''Air & Space Magazine'', February/March 2007.

Retrieved: 5 July 2009.</ref> During the second half of the 1930s, Mew Gulls were dominant in air-racing in the UK and consistently recorded the fastest times until the outbreak of war stopped all civilian flying in late 1939.\n\n==Design and development==\nWith the [[Percival Gull]] already making a name for itself as a racer, over several months in 1933\u20131934, Capt. [[Edgar Percival|Edgar W. Percival]] designed and built a single-seat racer derivative initially named the '''E1''' 'Mew Gull'. This was developed into the '''E2''', '''E2H''' and the '''E3H''' variants between 1934 and 1938. The sometimes-used designation \"P6\" is incorrect; this retrospective tag was created after Percival left the company and long after the Mew Gulls were built, thus no Mew Gulls were ever built as \"P6s\". With the exception of the sole E3H, ''G-AFAA'' \u2013 which was built after the company moved to Luton, all of the Mew gulls were built in the small factory at Gravesend. The E3H, whilst very strongly visually resembling the E2H, was in truth a totally new and different machine, with each element differing from its predecessor in some way. It was most certainly not a 'clipped-wing' version of the E2H as it has sometimes been described.\n\nStructurally, there was very little commonality of parts between the Gulls IV/ VI/ Vega Gull and the Mew Gull, other than a few minor components. All of the Gulls, however, did use a similar generic structure. Proprietary equipment such as engines, airscrews, spinners, instruments, undercarriage legs, wheels and tyres were generally common to all series. The Mew Gulls (apart from the E1 in its initial configuration) used a fixed, conventional oleomatic main [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] and a fully castoring tailskid. Small manually operated, split trailing-edge wing flaps were incorporated into the mainplanes, but were \"...singularly ineffective even when fully extended\".<ref>Ogilvy, David F. ''Motorsport, Vol.XXVIII, No. 4, April 1952.''.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was designed for handicapped air racing which gained huge popularity in the UK during the 1920s and especially 1930s \u2013 the so-called \"Golden Age\" of aviation. The [[King's Cup Race]], an annual handicapped air racing event developed to aid in the development of [[United Kingdom|British]] light aircraft, was considered to be the \"Blue-Riband\" event. Ultimately, Mew Gulls went on to win this event four times.\n\nThe prototype ''G-ACND'' first flew in March 1934 with a 165&nbsp;hp [[Napier Javelin]], but it was replaced with a more powerful and reliable 200&nbsp;hp Gipsy Six engine, fitted with a fixed-pitch airscrew, prior to its first race.\n\n==Type history==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe [[King's Cup Race|King's Cup]] was a handicap race dating back to 1922; each racing result was compared to the time that the committee decided each contestant should have completed the course. The greater the margin by which an entry beat its prescribed time, the better its chance of winning. Initially [[George V of England|King George V]] was to present a cup to the winner, and like the [[Schneider Trophy]], the same cup would be engraved and awarded to the new winner each year. After the first year's race it was decided that a new cup would be presented each year.\n\nPercival entered the King's Cup Race in July 1934, but failed to place. The original E1 was redesigned following an accident into the much-refined E2 configuration, with much of the design work completed by Arthur Bage. In July 1935, with a 180&nbsp;hp French [[R\u00e9gnier Motor Company|R\u00e9gnier]] installed, ''G-ACND'' competed in the [[Coupe Armand Esders]], a race of 1,046&nbsp;miles from Deauville, France to Cannes and back. The Mew Gull was flown by Count de Chateaubrun, the Percival representative in France, and averaged 188&nbsp;mph in the race. Immediately after, the original British de Havilland Gipsy Six was reinstalled. Guy de Chateaubrun subsequently became the only pilot to [[bail out]] of a Mew Gull, abandoning ''G-ACND'' because of fog.\n\nIn September 1935 Percival placed 1st in a {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} race, and in July 1936 he finished 4th in the King's Cup Race flying ''G-AEKL'', the third Mew Gull and first \"production\" E2H. Later in August, Percival finished 7th in the 174-mile race for the Folkestone Trophy.\n\nIn September 1936 ''G-AEKL'', having previously been Edgar Percival's private mount, was re-engined and modified to enter in the [[Schlesinger Race]]. The Schlesinger African Air Race was a race from England to South Africa (6,154&nbsp;miles), but G-AEKL was withdrawn ten days before the Schlesinger following a fatal taxiing accident at Liverpool [[Speke Airport]]. Two other E2H Mew Gulls were entered, both of which had been built at the same time to the same specification as the modified ''KL''. Both failed to finish the race to South Africa. In the 1937 King's Cup Race, the rebuilt and re-painted ''G-AEKL'' was 1st with Charles Gardner at the controls in his house-colours of dark blue with pale-blue lettering and trim (See Flight of the Mew Gull, p91.). He averaged 234&nbsp;mph over the 1,442-mile course. Percival flew his latest E3H \"Super\"-Mew ''G-AFAA'', the sixth and last Mew Gull built, to a third-place finish and still another E2H, ''G-AEXF'' was raced by [[Alex Henshaw]].\n\nThe 1938 King's Cup Race was a 1,012&nbsp;mile event and this time, Alex Henshaw's much modified E2H ''G-AEXF'' came in 1st at 236&nbsp;mph and Giles Guthrie in his red \"standard\" E2H ''G-AEKL'' placed 2nd. Edgar Percival flew a third Mew Gull, the E3H (''G-AFAA'') and finished 6th. Percival might easily have won, but as well as being made scratch-man by the Handicappers, he left the fine-tuning of his airscrew pitches until just before the race and his ground-crew were still tinkering with them as Alex Henshaw took off. At this time the Bracket-Type airscrew simply did not have the pitch-range to cope with the exceptionally wide speed range of the E3H (59\u2013265&nbsp;mph). An optimisation for either cruise or takeoff and climb would inevitably compromise the other.\n\nAlex Henshaw attempted to take the England \u2013 Cape Town Record in 1939, taking off on 5 February 1939 from [[Gravesend Airport]], landing at [[Wingfield Aerodrome]] at the Cape the next day, covering the 6,377&nbsp;miles course in 39&nbsp;hours and 25&nbsp;minutes, averaging 209.44&nbsp;mph while in the air. The return trip was just 11&nbsp;minutes longer. During all of Alex Henshaw's adventures in this aircraft, it was never damaged.\n[[File:Percival P.6 Mew Gull G-AEXF WVTN 16.05.53.jpg|thumb|right|Mew Gull ''G-AEXF'' wearing racing number ''97'' when competing in the 1953 UK National Air Races at [[Wolverhampton (Pendeford) airfield]] in May 1953]]\nHenshaw sold ''G-AEXF'' to Frenchman Victor Vermoral in late 1939. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the aircraft was stored in a hangar in France with several owners continuing to hide it from German authorities. In 1950, Hugh Scrope found and bought it, and with Doug Bianchi's help, refurbished the aircraft to fly it back home to England. After restoration, ''G-AEXF'' continued its racing career but it was damaged in a landing accident in August 1951 at Shoreham.  J.N. Somers, the next owner repaired it and raced ''G-AEXF'' again. A new owner, Ernest Crabtree, flew it last in the 1965 [[Manx Air Derby]]. By this time however, other owners had further altered this historic aircraft, resulting in lowered performance. Eventually, the derelict aircraft found its way into the hands of a poorly run museum, where it became damp, had its wings crudely sawn off, and many parts lost to souvenir hunters. In this state, Tom Storey and Martin Barraclough acquired the aircraft and rebuilt it during the late 1970s. Wishing to make the aircraft more practical to operate, a configuration closer to its original design was chosen, making ''G-AEXF'' look somewhat like an E2H/E3H hybrid, painted in the white and [[British Racing Green]] she wore when owned by Alex Henshaw in the 1930s. ''XF'' was again damaged at Redhill in late 1983, when an Auster taxied into it. The aircraft continued to be operated in the configuration as rebuilt by Storey and Barraclough until it was offered for sale.\n\nDesmond Penrose was the next owner, who based the machine at Old Warden. The aircraft was written off two further times: one at the time of purchase and again a few years later. After the first of these rebuilds, the machine was re-configured to resemble its configuration for the 1939 Cape flight. G-AEXF was extensively rebuilt yet again for a third time and continued to operate from Old Warden for some time until sold-on.\n\nIn 2002, ''G-AEXF'' was sold to Rob Fleming and was operated by The Real Aeroplane Company at the Breighton Aerodrome, Yorkshire, UK. It was temporarily shipped over to the US to fly in a \"demonstration race\" at the 2003 [[National Championship Air Races]] at Reno, Nevada, the first Mew Gull to touch American soil. In 2012, ''G-AEXF'' was operating from Breighton,\n\n76 years after her original incarnation. In October 2013 ''G-AEXF'' was sold to the [[Shuttleworth Collection]] at Old Warden, Bedfordshire, UK, where it remains flying as part of the museum.\n\nA UK Registered replica of a Mew Gull, ''G-HEKL'', is now airworthy in the UK.\n\n==Variants==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe Mew Gulls were a family of \"half-siblings,\" each tailored to the customer's demands.  Six were built:\n\n===G-ACND===\nThe prototype Mew Gull, designated '''Type E.1''' was fitted with a [[Napier Javelin]] engine, and first flew in March 1934. In October 1935, ''G-ACND'' was destroyed in a crash near [[Angoul\u00eame]] during the [[Coupe Michelin]].\n\n===G-ACND===\n[[File:Percival_Mew_Gull_photo_Le_Pontentiel_A\u00e9rien_Mondial_1936.jpg|thumb|Percival Mew Gull G-ACND photo from Le Pontentiel A\u00e9rien Mondial 1936]]\nThe '''Type E.2''', powered by a 200&nbsp;hp Gipsy Six, carried the same registration as its predecessor but was almost a complete re-design. ''G-ACND'' was temporarily fitted with a smaller 180&nbsp;hp Regnier engine to qualify for the [[Coupe Armand Esders]] of 1935.  With the Gipsy Six reinstated, the aircraft flew in a number of later races and won the [[Folkestone Trophy Race]].\n\n===G-AEKL===\n[[File:Replica Percival Mew Gull 'G-HEKL' (20332997744).jpg|thumb|''G-HEKL'' in 2015, a replica of the Percival Mew Gull ''G-AEKL''.]]\nThe '''E.2H'''. Fitted with a De Havilland Gipsy Six and flown by Edgar Percival in the King's Cup and [[Folkestone]] Trophy Races of 1936. Sold and re-engined with a Gipsy Six Series II, ''G-AEKL'' was entered in the [[Schlesinger Race]] along with''ZS-AHM'' and ''ZS-AHO''. However, the aircraft was damaged in a fatal accident at Liverpool Speke Airport that autumn, [[Tom Campbell Black]] being killed.  Rebuilt in 1937, ''G-AEKL'' won the Newcastle Race for its new owner. G-AEKL was rebuilt twice, was fitted with three different engines and had a total of six paint schemes. Subsequently, the aircraft passed through several hands before being destroyed by German bombs at Lympne early in the war.\n\n===ZS-AHM/G-AEXF===\n''The Golden City'', also an E2H, was built to the order of A.M. Miller for the Schlesinger Race and powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. Miller retired at the Belgrade checkpoint. Percival re-engined the aircraft with a Gipsy Six and sold it to [[Bill Humble]] who registered it in the UK as ''G-AEXF''. Humble never took delivery, instead selling it to Alex Henshaw, who soon won the 1937 Folkestone Trophy with ''G-AEXF''. For 1938, ''XF'' flew with a Gipsy Six R engine to win the Kings Cup. In February 1939, then powered by a Gipsy Six Series II and with revised equipment, it set a new mark for the out-and-home Cape class-record which stood until 2009. Although rebuilt many times and essentially a replica, ''G-AEXF'' powered by a Gipsy Queen II is owned and operated by [[The Shuttleworth Collection]], [[Old Warden]] and displays at airshows during the summer months.<ref>[http://www.shuttleworth.org/collection/mewgull/ The Shuttleworth Collection - Mew Gull] Retrieved 26 April 2017</ref>\n\nAJD Engineering (Ipswich, UK) who restored the original Mew Gull ''G-AEXF'' after its crash at Shuttleworth were commissioned by the late [[Alex Henshaw]] to manufacture a static replica Mew Gull, representing the Cape configuration of ''G-AEXF''. This aircraft is now complete and on initial display at the [[RAF Museum Hendon]].<ref>[http://www.hawker-restorations-ltd.co.uk/_images/_completed/mewgull/mewgull.html \"Static Mew Gull \u2013 Henshaw Rebuild.\"] ''hawker-restorations-ltd.co.uk''. Retrieved: 5 December 2009.</ref>\n\n===ZS-AHO/G-AEMO===\n''Baragwanath'', was another E2H powered by a Gipsy Six Series II engine, built to the order of S.S. \"Stan\" Halse for the Schlesinger Race. Due to bad visibility, Halse made a forced landing in a ploughed field in [[Southern Rhodesia]], where the aircraft flipped onto its back and was written off. At the time of the accident, Halse was well ahead of the rest of the field, so much so, that by the time Scott and Guthrie's winning Vega Gull arrived, most of the disappointed spectators had gone home.\n\n===G-AFAA===\nThe one-off '''Type E.3H''' (the so-called ''\"Super\"-Mew '') was Edgar Percival's personal mount. While looking very much the same as the E2H, this was actually a completely new design, powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. It first flew in 1937 and was raced by Percival in 1937\u20131939. On loan for propeller trials at Hatfield during the war, ''G-AFAA'' was written off in a landing accident by a de Havilland pilot. The remains of this aircraft were burned with those of ''G-ACND'' at a Percival Aircraft garden fete at Luton Airport immediately after the war.\n\n==Specifications (Type E.1)==\n{{aircraft specifications\n<!-- if you do not understand how to use this template, please ask at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft]] -->\n|plane or copter?=<!-- options: plane/copter -->plane\n|jet or prop?=<!-- options: jet/prop/both/neither -->prop\n|ref=British Civil Aircraft Since 1919<ref>Jackson, Aubrey J.
