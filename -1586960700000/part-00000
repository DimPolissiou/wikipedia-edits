The name of the team was also the name of [[Fred Gibson (racing driver)|Fred Gibson]]'s automotive business in [[Sydney]]. As Gibson was also a driver for the [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford Works Team]], his team was sometimes a pseudo-works team when the Ford factory did not enter.\n\n==History==\n\n===Group C===\nThe team was established by Howard Marsden in 1981 as the in-house factory [[Nissan]] motorsport operation after Nissan decided to change from rallying to touring car racing. It made its debut in the [[1981 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst. A limited campaign in the [[1982 Australian Touring Car Championship]] was followed by a more concerted effort in the [[1982 Australian Endurance Championship]], with Nissan winning the  Makes title in that series. This was followed by full campaigns in [[1983 Australian Touring Car season|1983]] and [[1984 Australian Touring Car season|1984]]. The 1.8 litre [[Datsun Bluebird 910|Bluebird turbo]] was fast but fragile, although [[George Fury]] did finish second in the [[1983 Australian Touring Car Championship]] (without taking a round win) and took pole position in the [[1984 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst with a lap time that would stand as a record until [[1990 Tooheys 1000|1990]].\n\nAt one point of 1984, Marsden had gone to [[Japan]] to discuss Nissan's plans for the new [[Group A]] category, and when he returned he joined the team at a test session at [[Melbourne]]'s [[Calder Park Raceway]] where lead driver Fury was substantially faster than ever before and had broken the existing touring car lap record on the 1.6&nbsp;km circuit. [[Fred Gibson (racing driver)|Fred Gibson]] told the story that the normally placid Marsden went into a rage and threatened to fire the entire team on the spot when he found the Bluebird was fitted with a 2.0 litre turbo engine and not the 1.8 litre unit it raced with.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFred Gibson, who gave the Bluebird turbo its first race win in Australian touring car racing during the 1983 AMSCAR Series at [[Sydney]]'s [[Amaroo Park]], retired from driving at the end of 1983 and in 1985 took over from Howard Marsden as team owner/manager. Gibson later described the Bluebird Turbo as ''\"A shithouse little car\"''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Group A===\n\n====1986-1987====\nAfter sitting out 1985 while [[Nissan]] sorted out the homologation of its first [[Group A]] car, Nissan reappeared in [[1986 Australian Touring Car season|1986]] with two [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline RS DR30]]s, one driven all year by longtime team driver [[George Fury]], and the second shared between Gary Scott and [[Glenn Seton]], with Scott claiming pole position for the [[1986 James Hardie 1000]] (Seton partnered Fury who qualified 3rd). In [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987]], Seton drove the second car all year to 2nd place both in the [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987 ATCC]] and at the [[1987 James Hardie 1000|James Hardie 1000]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]] which was also a round of the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship|inaugural]] [[World Touring Car Championship]]. Seton's Skyline was co-driven at Bathurst by twice [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] and 1986 [[Volvo]] team driver [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 7|year=1988|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\nAfter Fury took four round wins in the [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship]] and finished an unlucky runner-up in the series to the [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo 240T]] of [[Robbie Francevic]], the [[Altria|Peter Jackson]] sponsored team scored its first big win when Fury and Seton led Scott and new team driver Terry Shiel to a 1-2 win at the [[1986 Castrol 500]] at [[Sandown Raceway]], the traditional warm up event for the [[Bathurst 1000]]. Fury, partnered by Shiel, would back up to win his second [[Sandown 500]] in [[1987 Castrol 500|1987]].\n\nThe Nissan team also raced a [[Nissan Gazelle]] in the [[1987 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]] for 20-year-old [[Mark Skaife]], who had previously shown good form finishing second in the 1985 and 1986 [[Ford Laser]] series held at Amaroo Park. Skaife, who had joined the Nissan team as a mechanic in 1987, went on to win the 2.0 Litre championship, winning three of the four rounds of the series to break the stranglehold that [[Toyota]] had on the baby car class. He was joined at Bathurst in the Gazelle by [[Adelaide Hills]] Nissan dealer Grant Jarrett. During qualifying, Jarrett was having trouble making the class cut off time and it looked as if the Gazelle, which due to the race being an [[FIA]] WTCC race was forced to run in a higher engine class than it did in Australia (putting it in the same class as the [[E30 M3|BMW M3]]), would be a non-qualifier. However, late in Friday qualifying Jarrett managed to make the cut. During the time Jarrett was on his qualifying run, Skaife was reportedly nowhere to be seen in the Nissan pits. When the car returned to the pits it was driven straight into the garage and the doors closed. Both drivers emerged a short time later, with Skaife having damp hair and a flushed face while Jarret looked more like he had just got out of a shower than a touring car. This led to speculation it was Skaife and not Jarrett who had just been in the car for its final qualifying run. The pair finished the race in 19th place after numerous mechanical problems which had started within the first 10 laps. Despite the speculation that he had not driven his fastest qualifying laps, in the race Jarrett proved his critics wrong and would be credited with a faster race lap than he recorded in qualifying. However, in a magazine interview almost 20 years later, Fred Gibson admitted that it was indeed Skaife who qualified the car using Jarrett's driving suit and helmet.\n\n====1988-1990====\nFor [[1988 Australian Touring Car season|1988]], the new [[Nissan Skyline#GTS-R|Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R]] was introduced. The new car featured a [[Nissan RB engine#RB20|2.0 Litre]] turbocharged [[Straight-six engine]] which produced approximately {{Convert|410|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, almost {{Convert|70|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} more than the outdated DR30's turbocharged [[Nissan FJ engine#FJ20ET|4cyl]] engine. Also, the HR31 featured front and rear spoilers which helped with high speed stability, something the old car lacked with team drivers reporting the cars as being frightful to drive on the high speed Conrod Straight at Bathurst where they were reaching speeds up to {{Convert|260|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 1986.\n\nUnfortunately for the team parts for the car were late in arriving as Nissan also had to supply to teams in [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|Japan]] and [[European Touring Car Championship|Europe]] (the European Nissan team was in fact run by Howard Marsden). This saw the car not debuted until Round 5 in [[Adelaide International Raceway|Adelaide]] in the hands of Seton. Seton and Fury alternated driving the car while the team built its second, and it would not be until Round 8 at Amaroo Park before that second car appeared. Despite the new cars tendency to be unreliable, especially with its transmission, Seton and Fury showed enough speed in the ATCC to give hope to an end of the [[Ford Sierra RS500|Ford Sierra]] domination, though in reality the team was playing catch-up all year having to develop the car as they raced it. The car was also homologated with only a small capacity turbo which limited its power output, with power peaking at around {{Convert|470|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in 1990.\n\nAt Sandown for the annual [[1988 Enzed 500|Sandown 500]], the Fury / Skaife car had led for a number of laps (after all the leading Sierras except [[Allan Moffat]]'s had retired or been delayed with mechanical problems), and Skaife was holding a 30-second lead over the [[Larry Perkins]] / [[Denny Hulme]] [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV|Holden Commodore]] [[Holden V8 engine|V8]], before retiring while in the lead on lap 94 with differential failure. The Seton / [[Anders Olofsson]] car (which Seton had qualified 3rd, though almost two seconds slower than [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]]'s pole winning time in a Sierra) had retired on the third lap of the race with the same transmission failure that would put it out within seconds of the start of the Tooheys 1000 a few weeks later. Until the homologation of a proper racing 5-speed Getrag gearbox from 1989, the GTS-R's biggest drawback was its production based transmission.\n\nThe team suffered a setback in August 1988 when Seton rolled the #15 Skyline during a media day at Bathurst. This would set the tone for a disastrous [[1988 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]] campaign which saw both Skylines out by lap 17, with Seton's car destroying its gearbox as the green flag was waved to start the race (he made it only as far as the pit exit gate), while Fury's car was out with overheating after the fan belt flew off the engine at close to {{Convert|250|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} on Conrod Straight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 8|year=1989|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Against a flock of the all-powerful [[Ford Sierra RS500]]s, Fury managed to qualify the Skyline in 10th place at Bathurst. He would use Seton's car in the \"Tooheys Dozen\" shootout as co-driver Mark Skaife had crashed the #30 car during practice and it was still under repair. Fury (10th) and [[Larry Perkins]] (8th), driving one of the new Holden Commodore VL SS Group A SVs, were the only non-Ford Sierra drivers to qualify in the Top 10 at Bathurst, though they were joined by the non-Fords of [[Peter Brock]] (BMW M3) and Nissan Europe driver [[Allan Grice]] (Commodore) in the shootout. 1988 was also the only year the shootout would not decide the top 10 grid positions for the race.\n\nIn [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]], title sponsor [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], who was dissatisfied at being given secondary status behind Nissan for their signage on the Skylines throughout 1988, offered its sponsorship [[Australian dollar|dollars]] to Glenn Seton who had left to form his own team, [[Glenn Seton Racing]]. Twice ATCC champion and triple Bathurst winner [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] was hired as a replacement. The team expanded to three cars for some events with [[Mark Skaife]] driving. Wins were achieved at the [[Winton Raceway|Winton]] ATCC round (Fury) and at the [[1989 .05 - 500|Sandown 500]] (Richards/Skaife) with a 3rd and 4th placing at [[1989 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 9|year=1990|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Driving the HR31, Richards was the only non-[[Ford Sierra RS500]] driver to qualify for the '''Tooheys Top 10''' pole runoff at Bathurst.\n[[File:Gtrskaife.jpg|thumb|[[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] as raced in [[1992 Australian Touring Car season|1992]]]]\n\nFor [[1990 Australian Touring Car season|1990]] the team reverted to two cars for Richards and Skaife with long time team driver George Fury let go by the team. At round 7 Skaife debuted the [[4WD]], twin-turbocharged [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] at the [[Mallala Motor Sport Park|Mallala Raceway]]. After qualifying 3rd, Skaife then showed what the previously dominant Sierra runners feared when he stormed to the front and was pulling away from the field before the car suffered a hub failure mid-race. Richards then moved into the GT-R for the last two rounds to win the series at [[Barbagallo Raceway|Barbagallo]] and [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]]. After finishing 4th in a quiet race in [[Perth]], Richards won the race at Oran Park and secured the first ATCC win for both Nissan and Gibson.\n\nThe GT-R was favourite to qualify in pole at [[1990 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]], though brake dramas saw Richards only set 11th best time. In a move that was actually illegal (though it was not known until years later), after discovering problems with the GT-R following Saturday afternoon's final practice session, that night Gibson's team covertly swapped to their spare car (the ATCC car), including putting the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] [[Racecam]] unit into the car so that no one would be any wiser. Using the 'illegal' car, Richards started the race and stormed to the front in less than 10 laps, and despite long pit stops to replace brake pads, would remain a challenger before failing with drive-train failure, though the team was able to get the car back on the track and Richards and Skaife would finish 18th outright, 15 laps down on the winners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 10|year=1991|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\n====1991-1992====\nIn [[1991 Australian Touring Car season|1991]], the team dominated winning all but a handful of races.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 11|year=1992|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Richards and Skaife completely dominated the [[1991 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]] at Bathurst, easily claiming pole (Skaife), fastest lap (Skaife in the team's second car) and winning in race record time. Due to the demise of Group A in Australia after 1992, Skaife's pole time of 2:12.630 at Bathurst remains the fastest recorded Group A time on The Mountain.\n\nFollowing Bathurst, the team were then set to take the race winning Richards/Skaife GT-R to the [[Fuji Speedway]] in [[Japan]] for the 1991 Fuji 500 race, but were asked not to do so by the head of [[NISMO]] in Japan. The Japanese company were fearful that the Australian built car would easily outpace and defeat the Japanese GT-Rs at Fuji after having seen at first hand the overwhelming speed of the Gibson built car at Bathurst. NISMO claimed that it would be bad for business for their own factory backed cars, as well as those of their customers, to be soundly beaten by an overseas built (although still factory backed) GT-R.\n\nAt the end of 1991, the team took their GT-R to [[New Zealand]] for the Nissan Mobil series which saw two 500&nbsp;km races, the first on the [[Wellington 500|streets of Wellington]] where Skaife qualified the car second behind the [[Schnitzer Motorsport]] [[E30 M3|BMW M3 Evolution]] of [[Formula One]] driver [[Emanuele Pirro]]. After leading early, various suspension problems on the bumpy street circuit saw Richards and Skaife finish 5 laps down in 3rd place. A week later for the [[Pukekohe 500]] on a fast, open [[Pukekohe Park Raceway|circuit]] which suited the twin-turbo Nissan, Skaife easily qualified on pole before he and Richards went on to a 43-second win over the Schnitzer BMW of Pirro and [[Joachim Winkelhock]] with the [[Holden VN Commodore|Holden Commodore]] of Peter Brock and Larry Perkins finishing 3rd. This saw the pair ultimately finish 2nd to Pirro/Winkelhock in the 1991 Nissan Mobil series.<ref>[http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1991%20Nissan%20Mobil.html 1991 Nissan Mobil series at History of Touring Car Racing]</ref>\n\nFor [[1992 Australian Touring Car season|1992]], cigarette brand [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]] joined the team as title sponsor. During the season [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport|CAMS]] handicapped the GT-Rs in an attempt to bring it back to the field, which included upping the cars weight from 1360 to 1500&nbsp;kg over the course of the year (40&nbsp;kg was added before the ATCC and another 100&nbsp;kg was added before the endurance races), as well as adding pop-off valves to the turbos to restrict power. In spite of this and the team's year long claim that the cars were no longer competitive (which even led to court action in a failed attempt to have the handicaps lifted), Mark Skaife won the [[1992 Australian Touring Car Championship]], and then again teamed with Jim Richards to win the crash shortened [[1992 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]], with team mates [[Anders Olofsson]] and [[Neil Crompton]] finishing in third place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 12|year=1993|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Richards went on to finish the turbo era in style when he drove the GT-R to win both of the \"Clarke Shoes Group A Finale\" races at the [[1992 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]].\n\n===V8 Supercars===\n[[File:Skaife-vp94.jpg|thumb|right|[[Holden VP Commodore]] of [[Mark Skaife]] at [[Lakeside International Raceway]] in April 1994]]\n\n====Holden====\nFor [[1993 Australian Touring Car season|1993]], Australian touring car racing moved to the [[V8 Supercars|5.0L V8 formula]] open only to [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] and [[Holden]] (though at the time, [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 2.0 litre cars were allowed by CAMS and actually had their own [[1993 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship|championship]] run concurrently with the ATCC. These cars would soon evolve into the [[Super Touring]] class). Given his previous history with Ford being a factory team driver for them in the 1960s and 1970s, and with Rothmans also leasing its fleet from Ford, it was expected that Fred Gibson would return to the Blue Oval. However, after being less than impressed with Ford's offered deal, and with a better financial package on offer from Holden, Gibson Motorsport elected to race [[Holden VP Commodore]]s.<ref name=LifeintheFastLane>{{cite book|last=Skaife|first=Mark|title=Skaifey: Life in the Fast Lane|year=2010|publisher=Ebury Australia|isbn=9781741668995}}</ref> The team started with two cars assembled with many customer [[Holden Racing Team]] and [[Perkins Engineering]] components. After a lacklustre championship for all Commodore runners after it was found that the aero package devised for the VP Commodore by [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] in 1992 wasn't right (this was rectified with a revised package in mid-ATCC which saw the Commodores, especially the Winfield cars, vastly more competitive), the team were on the pace at [[1993 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]], with Skaife and Richards qualifying and finishing 2nd behind the similar VP Commodore (though one running a [[Holden V8 engine]] rather than the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] [[V8 engine]] used by GMS and other top level teams) of [[Larry Perkins]] and [[Gregg Hansford]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 13|year=1993|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> The team's second Commodore driven by Anders Olofsson and [[David Brabham]], who had also qualified in the top 10, finished in 4th place, two laps down on their team mates.\n\nIn [[1994 Australian Touring Car season|1994]] after the aero revisions to the VP Commodores during the [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship]] (won easily by ex-Gibson driver Glenn Seton driving a [[Ford EB Falcon]]), Skaife won his [[1994 Australian Touring Car Championship|second ATCC]] and the team's 4th overall.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 14|year=1994|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> [[1994 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]] was not so kind to the team. Skaife qualified the #1 VP Commodore in 3rd position and in the early (very) wet laps was battling for the lead with the HRT Commodore of Peter Brock and the Castrol Commodore of Perkins. Unfortunately their race ended on lap 39 with accident damage. The #2 car, driven by Olofsson and veteran [[Colin Bond]] in his last ever drive at Bathurst, started in 12th place and survived the wet/dry conditions throughout the day to finish 6th outright on the lead lap.\n\nIn practice at [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] in January 1995, Skaife had a major accident that kept him from driving in the opening round of the [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|Touring Car Championship]]. This coupled with the need to find a new major sponsor following the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]'s decision to ban all tobacco advertising in Australia from 1 January 1996, and a mid-season workshop move saw the team off the pace throughout much of [[1995 Australian Touring Car season|1995]], although Skaife would win the Eastern Creek round. At [[1995 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]], the Richards/Skaife car dominated the first 65 laps of the race, including showing some remarkable fuel economy (most of the Commodores and Falcons were pitting at around 28-30 laps while the #1 Winfield sponsored car first pitted on lap 35) before transmission failure ended their race. The fuel economy did not seem to affect the [[Holden VR Commodore]]'s performance as Skaife, who was in the car at the time of the failure, was building on the handy lead Richards had given him and was pulling away from the chasing [[Ford EF Falcon|Fords]] of Seton and John Bowe. The team's second car driven by Anders Oloffson and Jim Richards' son [[Steven Richards|Steven]] went on to finish the race 4th outright.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 15|year=1995|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\nFrom the end of 1995 tobacco sponsorship was outlawed. In a tight market, the team struggled to find a replacement sponsor, running just one plain white car in the opening rounds of [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship|1996 ATCC]] for Skaife. Eventually some funding came the team's way from [[Sega]] and Holden's Network Q second hand division, but it was a long way short of the team's previous funding levels.<ref name=LifeintheFastLane/><ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 16|year=1996|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> As a result of the lack of funds, GMS was forced to release Jim Richards. The financial situation also saw the team fall behind on development which saw Skaife fall to 9th in the ATCC. The team then recruited dual [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] champion [[John Cleland (racing driver)|John Cleland]] to partner Skaife at [[1996 AMP Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] where Skaife would qualify the car 9th and the pair would finish in a credible 7th outright.\n\nThe situation didn't improve in [[1997 Australian Touring Car season|1997]] with the team having to miss some rounds due to funding issues and Skaife leaving the team at the end of the championship to first partner (at [[1997 Sandown 500|Sandown]] and [[1997 AMP Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]]), then replace the retiring [[Peter Brock]] at the [[Holden Racing Team]]. A lifeline was thrown to the team by Garry Dumbrell, who contracted Gibson Motorsport to prepare his ex Gibson Motorsport [[Holden VS Commodore]] for the 1997 endurance races with [[Darren Hossack]] and [[Steven Ellery]] finishing 6th at [[1997 Primus 1000 Classic|Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=V8 Bathurst 1|year=1997|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1329-3184}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1998 Australian Touring Car season|1998]], the team expanded to three cars, two Wynns cars for Darren Hossack and Darren Pate and a third car for the [[Holden Young Lions]] entry for Steven Ellery which was sub-contracted by the Holden Racing Team.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=V8 Bathurst 2|year=1998|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1329-3184}}</ref>\n\nFor [[1999 Australian Touring Car season|1999]], the team built two new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodores]] and recruited [[Steven Richards]] and [[Greg Murphy]] to drive the Wynns sponsored cars. A development program saw Murphy win a race at [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] before the pair won at [[1999 FAI 1000|Bathurst]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 19|year=1999|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\n====Garry Dumbrell====\nIn December 1999 Fred Gibson sold the team to Garry Dumbrell. In [[2000 Australian Touring Car season|2000]] the cars were sponsored by [[Kmart|K-Mart]] with Richards winning in Canberra and the pair finishing 3rd at [[2000 FAI 1000|Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 20|year=2000|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\n====Bob Forbes====\nWith the category's star driver, [[Craig Lowndes]], having negotiated his way out of his management contract with [[Tom Walkinshaw]], he was expected to leave the [[Holden Racing Team]] at the end of 2000. [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] were very keen to gain his services and a deal was done that was portrayed as Fred Gibson buying back his old team and signing Lowndes to drive. It later emerged that it was Bob Forbes and not Fred Gibson who had bought the team from Garry Dumbrell, with Gibson only have purchased the Racing Entitlement Contract.<ref name=FederalCourt29Jun05>{{cite AustLII|FCA|749|2005|litigants=Gibson Motor Sport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Robert James Forbes |courtname=auto |date=29 June 2005}}.</ref>\n\nAn ex [[Stone Brothers Racing]] [[Ford AU Falcon]] was purchased for Lowndes to race throughout the [[2001 V8 Supercar season|2001]] championship before a Gibson Motorsport car debuted at [[2001 V8 Supercar 1000|Bathurst]]. The team also ran a second car for Rodney Forbes. A falling-out between Forbes and Gibson saw the latter leave the team after Bathurst. As Forbes owned his own Racing Entitlement contract, Gibson sold his to [[Briggs Motor Sport]].<ref name=FederalCourt29Jun05/>\n\nFor [[2002 V8 Supercar season|2002]], the team was rebranded as 00 Motorsport with [[Neil Crompton]] driving a second car. At the end of 2002, Ford withdrew their support with Lowndes and Crompton both leaving.<ref name=FederalCourt29Jun05/>\n\n===Demise===\nFor [[2003 V8 Supercar season|2003]], two new [[Ford BA Falcon|BA Falcons]] were built for Rodney Forbes and [[Greg Ritter]] to race. The team closed after round 6 of the series. The Racing Entitlement Contract was sold to [[Paul Weel Racing|Team Brock]] and the hardware in 2004 to [[WPS Racing]].\n\nAfter leaving the team, Fred Gibson retained ownership of the team's [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] workshop. It was later leased to [[Paul Weel Racing]] and today<!--April 2014--> is [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]]'s base.\n\n==Open Wheelers==\nGibson Motorsport first competed in [[Open-wheel car|Open-wheel]] racing in the [[1988 Australian Drivers' Championship]] (also known as the CAMS Gold Star), run for [[Australian Formula 2|Formula 2]] cars. In Round 4 of the championship at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]], Glenn Seton drove a Nissan powered [[Ralt|Ralt RT4]] to an easy win in what was his only race of the series. Seton was to have had dual driving duties on the day, also debuting the HR31 Skyline in the ATCC race to which the Formula 2 cars were a support category. However, only one of the Skyline's was race ready and with Seton already driving the Ralt, George Fury was given the drive in the new Skyline.\n\nThe team entered a [[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|Spa FB001]] for Mark Skaife to drive in the [[1990 Australian Drivers' Championship]] for [[Formula Holden]] cars (under the name of Skaife Racing P/L). Skaife would finish 3rd in the championship, winning Round 4 at [[Mallala Motor Sport Park|Mallala]] in [[South Australia]] (the same day that Skaife gave the Nissan GT-R its ATCC debut) and Round 5 at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]].\n\nMark Skaife would go on to win the Gold Star for Gibson in [[1991 Australian Drivers' Championship|1991]], [[1992 Australian Drivers' Championship|1992]] and [[1993 Australian Drivers' Championship|1993]]. His win in both the CAMS Gold Star and the ATCC in 1992 saw Skaife become the first, and so far only driver to win both championships in the same year, and he would complete the treble by partnering Jim Richards to win the crash shortened Bathurst 1000.\n\n==Rebirth==\nIn 2013, Fred Gibson reformed Gibson Motorsport as a race car preparer for cars participating in the Heritage Touring Cars series. Amongst its clients are the owners of former Gibson Motorsport Nissans. Some of the former race team personnel work on the cars, while former GMS drivers Jim Richards and Mark Skaife have both driven their former Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-Rs in historic competition, while George Fury has also reunited with his Bathurst pole winning Bluebird Turbo.<ref>[http://www.gibsonmotorsport.com.au/about-us/ About Us] Gibson Motorsport</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/04/25/where-are-they-now-fred-gibson-part-2//|title=Fred Gibson Part 2|work=Speedcafe|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.heritagetouringcars.com.au/phillip-island-gibson-motorsport-classic-report/ Phillip Island: Gibson Motorsport Classic Report] Heritage Touring Cars 25 March 2014</ref>\n\n==Championships==\nThis is a '''list of championships and series won by Gibson Motorsport''' from 1981 to 2003 in [[touring car racing]] and [[open wheel racing]].\n\n[[Australian Manufacturers' Championship]] results have not been included as that title was awarded to the manufacturer (e.g. Nissan) rather than to an individual driver or team.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Championship or Series\n!Driver\n!Car(s)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1987\n|[[Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Nissan Gazelle]]\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1990\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R]] <br> [[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1991\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|[[Australian Drivers' Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|SPA 003]] [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Holden]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1992\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|[[Australian Drivers' Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|SPA 003]] [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Holden]]\n|-\n|[[Amaroo Park#AMSCAR Series|AMSCAR Series]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1993\n|[[Australian Drivers' Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Lola Racing Cars|Lola T91/50]] [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Holden]]\n|-\n|[[Amaroo Park#AMSCAR Series|Aurora AFX AMSCAR Series]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Holden VP Commodore]]\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1994\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Holden VP Commodore]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Bathurst 1000 Wins==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! rowspan=2 | No\n! rowspan=2 | Team Name\n! rowspan=2 | Drivers\n!

The name of the team was also the name of [[Fred Gibson (racing driver)|Fred Gibson]]'s automotive business in [[Sydney]]. As Gibson was also a driver for the [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford Works Team]], his team was sometimes a pseudo-works team when the Ford factory did not enter.\n\n==History==\n\n===Group C===\nThe team was established by Howard Marsden in 1981 as the in-house factory [[Nissan]] motorsport operation after Nissan decided to change from rallying to touring car racing. It made its debut in the [[1981 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst. A limited campaign in the [[1982 Australian Touring Car Championship]] was followed by a more concerted effort in the [[1982 Australian Endurance Championship]], with Nissan winning the  Makes title in that series. This was followed by full campaigns in [[1983 Australian Touring Car season|1983]] and [[1984 Australian Touring Car season|1984]]. The 1.8 litre [[Datsun Bluebird 910|Bluebird turbo]] was fast but fragile, although [[George Fury]] did finish second in the [[1983 Australian Touring Car Championship]] (without taking a round win) and took pole position in the [[1984 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst with a lap time that would stand as a record until [[1990 Tooheys 1000|1990]].\n\nAt one point of 1984, Marsden had gone to [[Japan]] to discuss Nissan's plans for the new [[Group A]] category, and when he returned he joined the team at a test session at [[Melbourne]]'s [[Calder Park Raceway]] where lead driver Fury was substantially faster than ever before and had broken the existing touring car lap record on the 1.6&nbsp;km circuit. [[Fred Gibson (racing driver)|Fred Gibson]] told the story that the normally placid Marsden went into a rage and threatened to fire the entire team on the spot when he found the Bluebird was fitted with a 2.0 litre turbo engine and not the 1.8 litre unit it raced with.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFred Gibson, who gave the Bluebird turbo its first race win in Australian touring car racing during the 1983 AMSCAR Series at [[Sydney]]'s [[Amaroo Park]], retired from driving at the end of 1983 and in 1985 took over from Howard Marsden as team owner/manager. Gibson later described the Bluebird Turbo as ''\"A shithouse little car\"''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Group A===\n\n====1986-1987====\nAfter sitting out 1985 while [[Nissan]] sorted out the homologation of its first [[Group A]] car, Nissan reappeared in [[1986 Australian Touring Car season|1986]] with two [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline RS DR30]]s, one driven all year by longtime team driver [[George Fury]], and the second shared between Gary Scott and [[Glenn Seton]], with Scott claiming pole position for the [[1986 James Hardie 1000]] (Seton partnered Fury who qualified 3rd). In [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987]], Seton drove the second car all year to 2nd place both in the [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987 ATCC]] and at the [[1987 James Hardie 1000|James Hardie 1000]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]] which was also a round of the [[1987 World Touring Car Championship|inaugural]] [[World Touring Car Championship]]. Seton's Skyline was co-driven at Bathurst by twice [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] and 1986 [[Volvo]] team driver [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 7|year=1988|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\nAfter Fury took four round wins in the [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship]] and finished an unlucky runner-up in the series to the [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo 240T]] of [[Robbie Francevic]], the [[Altria|Peter Jackson]] sponsored team scored its first big win when Fury and Seton led Scott and new team driver Terry Shiel to a 1-2 win at the [[1986 Castrol 500]] at [[Sandown Raceway]], the traditional warm up event for the [[Bathurst 1000]]. Fury, partnered by Shiel, would back up to win his second [[Sandown 500]] in [[1987 Castrol 500|1987]].\n\nThe Nissan team also raced a [[Nissan Gazelle]] in the [[1987 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]] for 20-year-old [[Mark Skaife]], who had previously shown good form finishing second in the 1985 and 1986 [[Ford Laser]] series held at Amaroo Park. Skaife, who had joined the Nissan team as a mechanic in 1987, went on to win the 2.0 Litre championship, winning three of the four rounds of the series to break the stranglehold that [[Toyota]] had on the baby car class. He was joined at Bathurst in the Gazelle by [[Adelaide Hills]] Nissan dealer Grant Jarrett. During qualifying, Jarrett was having trouble making the class cut off time and it looked as if the Gazelle, which due to the race being an [[FIA]] WTCC race was forced to run in a higher engine class than it did in Australia (putting it in the same class as the [[E30 M3|BMW M3]]), would be a non-qualifier. However, late in Friday qualifying Jarrett managed to make the cut. During the time Jarrett was on his qualifying run, Skaife was reportedly nowhere to be seen in the Nissan pits. When the car returned to the pits it was driven straight into the garage and the doors closed. Both drivers emerged a short time later, with Skaife having damp hair and a flushed face while Jarret looked more like he had just got out of a shower than a touring car. This led to speculation it was Skaife and not Jarrett who had just been in the car for its final qualifying run. The pair finished the race in 19th place after numerous mechanical problems which had started within the first 10 laps. Despite the speculation that he had not driven his fastest qualifying laps, in the race Jarrett proved his critics wrong and would be credited with a faster race lap than he recorded in qualifying. However, in a magazine interview almost 20 years later, Fred Gibson admitted that it was indeed Skaife who qualified the car using Jarrett's driving suit and helmet.\n\n====1988-1990====\nFor [[1988 Australian Touring Car season|1988]], the new [[Nissan Skyline#GTS-R|Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R]] was introduced. The new car featured a [[Nissan RB engine#RB20|2.0 Litre]] turbocharged [[Straight-six engine]] which produced approximately {{Convert|410|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, almost {{Convert|70|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} more than the outdated DR30's turbocharged [[Nissan FJ engine#FJ20ET|4cyl]] engine. Also, the HR31 featured front and rear spoilers which helped with high speed stability, something the old car lacked with team drivers reporting the cars as being frightful to drive on the high speed Conrod Straight at Bathurst where they were reaching speeds up to {{Convert|260|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 1986.\n\nUnfortunately for the team parts for the car were late in arriving as Nissan also had to supply to teams in [[Japanese Touring Car Championship|Japan]] and [[European Touring Car Championship|Europe]] (the European Nissan team was in fact run by Howard Marsden). This saw the car not debuted until Round 5 in [[Adelaide International Raceway|Adelaide]] in the hands of Seton. Seton and Fury alternated driving the car while the team built its second, and it would not be until Round 8 at Amaroo Park before that second car appeared. Despite the new cars tendency to be unreliable, especially with its transmission, Seton and Fury showed enough speed in the ATCC to give hope to an end of the [[Ford Sierra RS500|Ford Sierra]] domination, though in reality the team was playing catch-up all year having to develop the car as they raced it. The car was also homologated with only a small capacity turbo which limited its power output, with power peaking at around {{Convert|470|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in 1990.\n\nAt Sandown for the annual [[1988 Enzed 500|Sandown 500]], the Fury / Skaife car had led for a number of laps (after all the leading Sierras except [[Allan Moffat]]'s had retired or been delayed with mechanical problems), and Skaife was holding a 30-second lead over the [[Larry Perkins]] / [[Denny Hulme]] [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV|Holden Commodore]] [[Holden V8 engine|V8]], before retiring while in the lead on lap 94 with differential failure. The Seton / [[Anders Olofsson]] car (which Seton had qualified 3rd, though almost two seconds slower than [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]]'s pole winning time in a Sierra) had retired on the third lap of the race with the same transmission failure that would put it out within seconds of the start of the Tooheys 1000 a few weeks later. Until the homologation of a proper racing 5-speed Getrag gearbox from 1989, the GTS-R's biggest drawback was its production based transmission.\n\nThe team suffered a setback in August 1988 when Seton rolled the #15 Skyline during a media day at Bathurst. This would set the tone for a disastrous [[1988 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]] campaign which saw both Skylines out by lap 17, with Seton's car destroying its gearbox as the green flag was waved to start the race (he made it only as far as the pit exit gate), while Fury's car was out with overheating after the fan belt flew off the engine at close to {{Convert|250|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} on Conrod Straight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 8|year=1989|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Against a flock of the all-powerful [[Ford Sierra RS500]]s, Fury managed to qualify the Skyline in 10th place at Bathurst. He would use Seton's car in the \"Tooheys Dozen\" shootout as co-driver Mark Skaife had crashed the #30 car during practice and it was still under repair. Fury (10th) and [[Larry Perkins]] (8th), driving one of the new Holden Commodore VL SS Group A SVs, were the only non-Ford Sierra drivers to qualify in the Top 10 at Bathurst, though they were joined by the non-Fords of [[Peter Brock]] (BMW M3) and Nissan Europe driver [[Allan Grice]] (Commodore) in the shootout. 1988 was also the only year the shootout would not decide the top 10 grid positions for the race.\n\nIn [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]], title sponsor [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], who was dissatisfied at being given secondary status behind Nissan for their signage on the Skylines throughout 1988, offered its sponsorship [[Australian dollar|dollars]] to Glenn Seton who had left to form his own team, [[Glenn Seton Racing]]. Twice ATCC champion and triple Bathurst winner [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] was hired as a replacement. The team expanded to three cars for some events with [[Mark Skaife]] driving. Wins were achieved at the [[Winton Raceway|Winton]] ATCC round (Fury) and at the [[1989 .05 - 500|Sandown 500]] (Richards/Skaife) with a 3rd and 4th placing at [[1989 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 9|year=1990|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Driving the HR31, Richards was the only non-[[Ford Sierra RS500]] driver to qualify for the '''Tooheys Top 10''' pole runoff at Bathurst.\n[[File:Gtrskaife.jpg|thumb|[[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] as raced in [[1992 Australian Touring Car season|1992]]]]\n\nFor [[1990 Australian Touring Car season|1990]] the team reverted to two cars for Richards and Skaife with long time team driver George Fury let go by the team. At round 7 Skaife debuted the [[4WD]], twin-turbocharged [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] at the [[Mallala Motor Sport Park|Mallala Raceway]]. After qualifying 3rd, Skaife then showed what the previously dominant Sierra runners feared when he stormed to the front and was pulling away from the field before the car suffered a hub failure mid-race. Richards then moved into the GT-R for the last two rounds to win the series at [[Barbagallo Raceway|Barbagallo]] and [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]]. After finishing 4th in a quiet race in [[Perth]], Richards won the race at Oran Park and secured the first ATCC win for both Nissan and Gibson.\n\nThe GT-R was favourite to qualify in pole at [[1990 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]], though brake dramas saw Richards only set 11th best time. In a move that was actually illegal (though it was not known until years later), after discovering problems with the GT-R following Saturday afternoon's final practice session, that night Gibson's team covertly swapped to their spare car (the ATCC car), including putting the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] [[Racecam]] unit into the car so that no one would be any wiser. Using the 'illegal' car, Richards started the race and stormed to the front in less than 10 laps, and despite long pit stops to replace brake pads, would remain a challenger before failing with drive-train failure, though the team was able to get the car back on the track and Richards and Skaife would finish 18th outright, 15 laps down on the winners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 10|year=1991|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\n====1991-1992====\nIn [[1991 Australian Touring Car season|1991]], the team dominated winning all but a handful of races.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 11|year=1992|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Richards and Skaife completely dominated the [[1991 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]] at Bathurst, easily claiming pole (Skaife), fastest lap (Skaife in the team's second car) and winning in race record time. Due to the demise of Group A in Australia after 1992, Skaife's pole time of 2:12.630 at Bathurst remains the fastest recorded Group A time on The Mountain.\n\nFollowing Bathurst, the team were then set to take the race winning Richards/Skaife GT-R to the [[Fuji Speedway]] in [[Japan]] for the 1991 Fuji 500 race, but were asked not to do so by the head of [[NISMO]] in Japan. The Japanese company were fearful that the Australian built car would easily outpace and defeat the Japanese GT-Rs at Fuji after having seen at first hand the overwhelming speed of the Gibson built car at Bathurst. NISMO claimed that it would be bad for business for their own factory backed cars, as well as those of their customers, to be soundly beaten by an overseas built (although still factory backed) GT-R.\n\nAt the end of 1991, the team took their GT-R to [[New Zealand]] for the Nissan Mobil series which saw two 500&nbsp;km races, the first on the [[Wellington 500|streets of Wellington]] where Skaife qualified the car second behind the [[Schnitzer Motorsport]] [[E30 M3|BMW M3 Evolution]] of [[Formula One]] driver [[Emanuele Pirro]]. After leading early, various suspension problems on the bumpy street circuit saw Richards and Skaife finish 5 laps down in 3rd place. A week later for the [[Pukekohe 500]] on a fast, open [[Pukekohe Park Raceway|circuit]] which suited the twin-turbo Nissan, Skaife easily qualified on pole before he and Richards went on to a 43-second win over the Schnitzer BMW of Pirro and [[Joachim Winkelhock]] with the [[Holden VN Commodore|Holden Commodore]] of Peter Brock and Larry Perkins finishing 3rd. This saw the pair ultimately finish 2nd to Pirro/Winkelhock in the 1991 Nissan Mobil series.<ref>[http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1991%20Nissan%20Mobil.html 1991 Nissan Mobil series at History of Touring Car Racing]</ref>\n\nFor [[1992 Australian Touring Car season|1992]], cigarette brand [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]] joined the team as title sponsor. During the season [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport|CAMS]] handicapped the GT-Rs in an attempt to bring it back to the field, which included upping the cars weight from 1360 to 1500&nbsp;kg over the course of the year (40&nbsp;kg was added before the ATCC and another 100&nbsp;kg was added before the endurance races), as well as adding pop-off valves to the turbos to restrict power. In spite of this and the teams year long claim that the cars were no longer competitive (which even led to court action in a failed attempt to have the handicaps lifted), Mark Skaife won the [[1992 Australian Touring Car Championship]], and then again teamed with Jim Richards to win the crash shortened [[1992 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]], with team mates [[Anders Olofsson]] and [[Neil Crompton]] finishing in third place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 12|year=1993|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> Richards went on to finish the turbo era in style when he drove the GT-R to win both of the \"Clarke Shoes Group A Finale\" races at the [[1992 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]].\n\n===V8 Supercars===\n[[File:Skaife-vp94.jpg|thumb|right|[[Holden VP Commodore]] of [[Mark Skaife]] at [[Lakeside International Raceway]] in April 1994]]\n\n====Holden====\nFor [[1993 Australian Touring Car season|1993]], Australian touring car racing moved to the [[V8 Supercars|5.0L V8 formula]] open only to [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] and [[Holden]] (though at the time, [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] 2.0 litre cars were allowed by CAMS and actually had their own [[1993 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship|championship]] run concurrently with the ATCC. These cars would soon evolve into the [[Super Touring]] class). Given his previous history with Ford being a factory team driver for them in the 1960s and 1970s, and with Rothmans also leasing its fleet from Ford, it was expected that Fred Gibson would return to the Blue Oval. However, after being less than impressed with Ford's offered deal, and with a better financial package on offer from Holden, Gibson Motorsport elected to race [[Holden VP Commodore]]s.<ref name=LifeintheFastLane>{{cite book|last=Skaife|first=Mark|title=Skaifey: Life in the Fast Lane|year=2010|publisher=Ebury Australia|isbn=9781741668995}}</ref> The team started with two cars assembled with many customer [[Holden Racing Team]] and [[Perkins Engineering]] components. After a lacklustre championship for all Commodore runners after it was found that the aero package devised for the VP Commodore by [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] in 1992 wasn't right (this was rectified with a revised package in mid-ATCC which saw the Commodores, especially the Winfield cars, vastly more competitive), the team were on the pace at [[1993 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]], with Skaife and Richards qualifying and finishing 2nd behind the similar VP Commodore (though one running a [[Holden V8 engine]] rather than the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] [[V8 engine]] used by GMS and other top level teams) of [[Larry Perkins]] and [[Gregg Hansford]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 13|year=1993|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> The teams second Commodore driven by Anders Olofsson and [[David Brabham]], who had also qualified in the top 10, finished in 4th place, two laps down on their team mates.\n\nIn [[1994 Australian Touring Car season|1994]] after the aero revisions to the VP Commodores during the [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship]] (won easily by ex-Gibson driver Glenn Seton driving a [[Ford EB Falcon]]), Skaife won his [[1994 Australian Touring Car Championship|second ATCC]] and the teams 4th overall.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 14|year=1994|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> [[1994 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]] was not so kind to the team. Skaife qualified the #1 VP Commodore in 3rd position and in the early (very) wet laps was battling for the lead with the HRT Commodore of Peter Brock and the Castrol Commodore of Perkins. Unfortunately their race ended on lap 39 with accident damage. The #2 car, driven by Olofsson and veteran [[Colin Bond]] in his last ever drive at Bathurst, started in 12th place and survived the wet/dry conditions throughout the day to finish 6th outright on the lead lap.\n\nIn practice at [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] in January 1995, Skaife had a major accident that kept him from driving in the opening round of the [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|Touring Car Championship]]. This coupled with the need to find a new major sponsor following the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]'s decision to ban all tobacco advertising in Australia from 1 January 1996, and a mid-season workshop move saw the team off the pace throughout much of [[1995 Australian Touring Car season|1995]], although Skaife would win the Eastern Creek round. At [[1995 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]], the Richards/Skaife car dominated the first 65 laps of the race, including showing some remarkable fuel economy (most of the Commodores and Falcons were pitting at around 28-30 laps while the #1 Winfield sponsored car first pitted on lap 35) before transmission failure ended their race. The fuel economy did not seem to affect the [[Holden VR Commodore]]'s performance as Skaife, who was in the car at the time of the failure, was building on the handy lead Richards had given him and was pulling away from the chasing [[Ford EF Falcon|Fords]] of Seton and John Bowe. The teams second car driven by Anders Oloffson and Jim Richards' son [[Steven Richards|Steven]] went on to finish the race 4th outright.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 15|year=1995|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\nFrom the end of 1995 tobacco sponsorship was outlawed. In a tight market, the team struggled to find a replacement sponsor, running just one plain white car in the opening rounds of [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship|1996 ATCC]] for Skaife. Eventually some funding came the team's way from [[Sega]] and Holden's Network Q second hand division, but it was a long way short of the team's previous funding levels.<ref name=LifeintheFastLane/><ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 16|year=1996|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref> As a result of the lack of funds, GMS was forced to release Jim Richards. The financial situation also saw the team fall behind on development which saw Skaife fall to 9th in the ATCC. The team then recruited dual [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] champion [[John Cleland (racing driver)|John Cleland]] to partner Skaife at [[1996 AMP Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] where Skaife would qualify the car 9th and the pair would finish in a credible 7th outright.\n\nThe situation didn't improve in [[1997 Australian Touring Car season|1997]] with the team having to miss some rounds due to funding issues and Skaife leaving the team at the end of the championship to first partner (at [[1997 Sandown 500|Sandown]] and [[1997 AMP Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]]), then replace the retiring [[Peter Brock]] at the [[Holden Racing Team]]. A lifeline was thrown to the team by Garry Dumbrell, who contracted Gibson Motorsport to prepare his ex Gibson Motorsport [[Holden VS Commodore]] for the 1997 endurance races with [[Darren Hossack]] and [[Steven Ellery]] finishing 6th at [[1997 Primus 1000 Classic|Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=V8 Bathurst 1|year=1997|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1329-3184}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1998 Australian Touring Car season|1998]], the team expanded to three cars, two Wynns cars for Darren Hossack and Darren Pate and a third car for the [[Holden Young Lions]] entry for Steven Ellery which was sub-contracted by the Holden Racing Team.<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=V8 Bathurst 2|year=1998|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1329-3184}}</ref>\n\nFor [[1999 Australian Touring Car season|1999]], the team built two new [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodores]] and recruited [[Steven Richards]] and [[Greg Murphy]] to drive the Wynns sponsored cars. A development program saw Murphy win a race at [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] before the pair won at [[1999 FAI 1000|Bathurst]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 19|year=1999|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\n====Garry Dumbrell====\nIn December 1999 Fred Gibson sold the team to Garry Dumbrell. In [[2000 Australian Touring Car season|2000]] the cars were sponsored by [[Kmart|K-Mart]] with Richards winning in Canberra and the pair finishing 3rd at [[2000 FAI 1000|Bathurst]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 20|year=2000|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}</ref>\n\n====Bob Forbes====\nWith the category's star driver, [[Craig Lowndes]], having negotiated his way out of his management contract with [[Tom Walkinshaw]], he was expected to leave the [[Holden Racing Team]] at the end of 2000. [[Ford Motor Company of Australia|Ford]] were very keen to gain his services and a deal was done that was portrayed as Fred Gibson buying back his old team and signing Lowndes to drive. It later emerged that it was Bob Forbes and not Fred Gibson who had bought the team from Garry Dumbrell, with Gibson only have purchased the Racing Entitlement Contract.<ref name=FederalCourt29Jun05>{{cite AustLII|FCA|749|2005|litigants=Gibson Motor Sport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Robert James Forbes |courtname=auto |date=29 June 2005}}.</ref>\n\nAn ex [[Stone Brothers Racing]] [[Ford AU Falcon]] was purchased for Lowndes to race throughout the [[2001 V8 Supercar season|2001]] championship before a Gibson Motorsport car debuted at [[2001 V8 Supercar 1000|Bathurst]]. The team also ran a second car for Rodney Forbes. A falling-out between Forbes and Gibson saw the latter leave the team after Bathurst. As Forbes owned his own Racing Entitlement contract, Gibson sold his to [[Briggs Motor Sport]].<ref name=FederalCourt29Jun05/>\n\nFor [[2002 V8 Supercar season|2002]], the team was rebranded as 00 Motorsport with [[Neil Crompton]] driving a second car. At the end of 2002, Ford withdrew their support with Lowndes and Crompton both leaving.<ref name=FederalCourt29Jun05/>\n\n===Demise===\nFor [[2003 V8 Supercar season|2003]], two new [[Ford BA Falcon|BA Falcons]] were built for Rodney Forbes and [[Greg Ritter]] to race. The team closed after round 6 of the series. The Racing Entitlement Contract was sold to [[Paul Weel Racing|Team Brock]] and the hardware in 2004 to [[WPS Racing]].\n\nAfter leaving the team, Fred Gibson retained ownership of the team's [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] workshop. It was later leased to [[Paul Weel Racing]] and today<!--April 2014--> is [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]]'s base.\n\n==Open Wheelers==\nGibson Motorsport first competed in [[Open-wheel car|Open-wheel]] racing in the [[1988 Australian Drivers' Championship]] (also known as the CAMS Gold Star), run for [[Australian Formula 2|Formula 2]] cars. In Round 4 of the championship at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]], Glenn Seton drove a Nissan powered [[Ralt|Ralt RT4]] to an easy win in what was his only race of the series. Seton was to have had dual driving duties on the day, also debuting the HR31 Skyline in the ATCC race to which the Formula 2 cars were a support category. However, only one of the Skyline's was race ready and with Seton already driving the Ralt, George Fury was given the drive in the new Skyline.\n\nThe team entered a [[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|Spa FB001]] for Mark Skaife to drive in the [[1990 Australian Drivers' Championship]] for [[Formula Holden]] cars (under the name of Skaife Racing P/L). Skaife would finish 3rd in the championship, winning Round 4 at [[Mallala Motor Sport Park|Mallala]] in [[South Australia]] (the same day that Skaife gave the Nissan GT-R its ATCC debut) and Round 5 at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]].\n\nMark Skaife would go on to win the Gold Star for Gibson in [[1991 Australian Drivers' Championship|1991]], [[1992 Australian Drivers' Championship|1992]] and [[1993 Australian Drivers' Championship|1993]]. His win in both the CAMS Gold Star and the ATCC in 1992 saw Skaife become the first, and so far only driver to win both championships in the same year, and he would complete the treble by partnering Jim Richards to win the crash shortened Bathurst 1000.\n\n==Rebirth==\nIn 2013, Fred Gibson reformed Gibson Motorsport as a race car preparer for cars participating in the Heritage Touring Cars series. Amongst its clients are the owners of former Gibson Motorsport Nissans. Some of the former race team personnel work on the cars, while former GMS drivers Jim Richards and Mark Skaife have both driven their former Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-Rs in historic competition, while George Fury has also reunited with his Bathurst pole winning Bluebird Turbo.<ref>[http://www.gibsonmotorsport.com.au/about-us/ About Us] Gibson Motorsport</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/04/25/where-are-they-now-fred-gibson-part-2//|title=Fred Gibson Part 2|work=Speedcafe|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.heritagetouringcars.com.au/phillip-island-gibson-motorsport-classic-report/ Phillip Island: Gibson Motorsport Classic Report] Heritage Touring Cars 25 March 2014</ref>\n\n==Championships==\nThis is a '''list of championships and series won by Gibson Motorsport''' from 1981 to 2003 in [[touring car racing]] and [[open wheel racing]].\n\n[[Australian Manufacturers' Championship]] results have not been included as that title was awarded to the manufacturer (e.g. Nissan) rather than to an individual driver or team.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Championship or Series\n!Driver\n!Car(s)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1987\n|[[Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Nissan Gazelle]]\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1990\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R]] <br> [[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1991\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|[[Australian Drivers' Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|SPA 003]] [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Holden]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1992\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|[[Australian Drivers' Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|SPA 003]] [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Holden]]\n|-\n|[[Amaroo Park#AMSCAR Series|AMSCAR Series]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Nissan Skyline R32 GT-R]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1993\n|[[Australian Drivers' Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Lola Racing Cars|Lola T91/50]] [[Buick V6 engine#LN3 Naturally Aspirated|Holden]]\n|-\n|[[Amaroo Park#AMSCAR Series|Aurora AFX AMSCAR Series]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Holden VP Commodore]]\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1994\n|[[Australian Touring Car Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Mark Skaife]]\n|[[Holden VP Commodore]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Bathurst 1000 Wins==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Class\n! rowspan=2 | No\n! rowspan=2 | Team Name\n! rowspan=2 | Drivers\n!

He also served as the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Public Utilities in the same Cabinet after a reshuffle and was later given the Deputy Minister of Finance portfolio.\n\nFollowing the election defeat of his party in 2001, he was made the Chief Opposition Whip and the Treasurer of the SLFP. In 2004 he became the Minister of Ports, Aviation and Media in the new cabinet of President [[Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga]].\n\nIn June 2005, after conflicts with Kumaratunga, he dropped the Media Ministry, but remained Cabinet Minister of Ports and Aviation. He became the campaign manager for Presidential candidate and Prime Minister [[Mahinda Rajapakse]]. When Rajapakse won and took office in November 2005, he surprised many by appointing Samaraweera to the additional post of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka|Foreign Minister]] instead of Prime Minister; Samaraweera maintained his other posts.\n\nIn late January 2007, Samaraweera was replaced as Foreign Minister, but remained as Minister of Ports and Aviation.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200701/29/eng20070129_345575.html \"Sri Lankan president reshuffles cabinet\"], Xinhua, January 29, 2007.</ref> On 9 February 2007, he was sacked from the cabinet together with ministers [[Anura Bandaranaike]] and [[Sripathi Sooriyarachchi]] after falling out with the president.

Its success began at the presidential level. Gradually, Southern voters began to elect Republicans to Congress and finally to statewide and local offices, particularly as some legacy segregationist Democrats retired or switched to the GOP.{{Who|date=May 2018}} In addition, the Republican Party worked for years to develop [[grassroots]] political organizations across the South, supporting candidates for local school boards and city and county offices as examples, but following the [[Watergate scandal]] Southern voters came out in support for the \"favorite son\" candidate, Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nFrom 1948 to 1984, the Southern states, for decades a stronghold for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], became key [[swing state]]s, providing the popular vote margins in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] and [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 elections]]. During this era, several Republican candidates expressed support for [[states' rights]], a reversal of the position held by southern states prior to the Civil War. Some political analysts said this term was used in the 20th century as a \"code word\" to represent opposition to federal enforcement of civil rights for blacks and to federal intervention on their behalf; many individual southerners had opposed passage of the Voting Rights Act.<ref name=\"Branch\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===20th-century Reconstruction to Solid South===\n{{main|Reconstruction Era|Solid South}}\nDuring the Reconstruction era (1863\u20131877), the Republican Party built up its base across the South and for a while had control in each state except Virginia, but from a national perspective, the Republican Party always gave priority to its much better established Northern state operations. The Northern party distrusted the [[scalawag]]s, found the avaricious [[carpetbaggers]] distasteful and lacked respect for the black component of their Republican Party in the South.  Richard Abbott says that national Republicans always \"stressed building their Northern base rather than extending their party into the South, and whenever the Northern and Southern needs conflicted the latter always lost\".<ref>Richard H. Abbott, ''The Republican Party and the South, 1855\u20131877: The First Southern Strategy'' (1986)  p. 231</ref> In 1868, the GOP spent only 5% of its war chest in the South. [[Ulysses S.

As a consequence, federal patronage did go to Southern blacks as long as there was a Republican in the White House. The issue exploded in 1912, when President [[William Howard Taft]] used control of the Southern delegations to defeat former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] at the Republican National Convention.<ref>Boris Heersink and Jeffery A.

Effectively, Southern white Democrats controlled all the votes of the expanded population by which Congressional apportionment was figured. Many of their representatives achieved powerful positions of seniority in Congress, giving them control of chairmanships of significant Congressional committees. Although the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] has a provision to reduce the Congressional representation of states that denied votes to their adult male citizens, this provision was never enforced. Because African Americans could not be voters, they were also prevented from being jurors and serving in local offices. Services and institutions for them in the segregated South were chronically underfunded by state and local governments, from which they were excluded.<ref name=\"Beginnings of black education\">[http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/education.htm \"Beginnings of black education\"], ''The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia.''

Between 1880 and 1904, Republican presidential candidates in the South received 35\u201340% of that section's vote (except in 1892, when the 16% for the Populists knocked Republicans down to 25%). From 1904 to 1948, Republicans received more than 30% of the section's votes only in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] (35.2%, carrying Tennessee) and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 elections]] (47.7%, carrying five states) after disenfranchisement.\n\nDuring this period, Republican administrations appointed blacks to political positions. Republicans regularly supported anti-[[lynching]] bills, but these were [[filibuster]]ed by Southern Democrats in the Senate. In the 1928 election, the Republican candidate [[Herbert Hoover]] rode the issues of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] and [[anti-Catholicism]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Ricky Floyd|title=Continuities in American anti-Catholicism: the Texas Baptist Standard and the coming of the 1960 election.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Continuities+in+American+anti-Catholicism:+the+Texas+Baptist+Standard...-a0162618834|newspaper=Baptist History and Heritage|date=January 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221202108/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/403.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> to carry five former Confederate states, with 62 of the 126 electoral votes of the section. After his victory, Hoover attempted to build up the Republican Party of the South, transferring his limited patronage away from blacks and toward the same kind of white Protestant businessmen who made up the core of the Northern Republican Party. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], which severely affected the South, Hoover soon became extremely unpopular. The gains of the Republican Party in the South were lost. In the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]], Hoover received only 18.1% of the Southern vote for re-election.\n\n===World War II and population changes===\nIn the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]], after President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] to desegregate the military, a group of conservative Southern Democrats known as Dixiecrats split from the Democratic Party in reaction to the inclusion of a civil rights plank in the party's platform. This followed a floor fight led by civil-rights activist, [[Minneapolis]] Mayor (and soon-to-be [[United States Senate|Senator]]) [[Hubert Humphrey]]. The disaffected conservative Democrats formed the States' Rights Democratic, or [[Dixiecrat]] Party and nominated Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]] for President. Thurmond carried four Deep South states in the general election: [[South Carolina]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]. The main plank of the States' Rights Democratic Party was maintaining [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] in the South. The Dixiecrats, failing to deny the Democrats the presidency in 1948, soon dissolved, but the split lingered. In the fall of 1964, Thurmond was one of the first conservative Southern Democrats to switch to the Republican Party just a couple months after Democratic President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] into law.<ref name=\"Goldwater\">{{cite news|title=Thurmond to Bolt Democrats Today; South Carolinian Will Join G.O.P. and Aid Goldwater| newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 16, 1964 |page=12 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/09/16/98447784.pdf |quote=Both senators have opposed the Administration on such matters as civil rights...|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Party of Civil Rights|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_05/023915.php|date=May 21, 2010|first=Steve|last=Benen|journal=[[Washington Monthly]]|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the splits in the Democratic Party, the population movements associated with [[World War II]] had a significant effect in changing the demographics of the South.

Changes in industry and growth in universities and the military establishment in turn attracted Northern transplants to the South and bolstered the base of the Republican Party. In the post-war presidential campaigns, Republicans did best in those fastest-growing states of the South that had the most Northern transplants. In the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]], [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] and [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 elections]], [[Virginia]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]] went Republican while Louisiana went Republican in 1956 and [[Texas]] twice voted for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and once for [[John F. Kennedy]]. In 1956, Eisenhower received 48.9% of the Southern vote, becoming only the second Republican in history (after [[Ulysses S.

Eisenhower was elected president in 1952, with strong support from the emerging middle class suburban element in the South. He appointed a number of Southern Republican supporters as federal judges in the South. They in turn ordered the desegregation of Southern schools in the 1950s and 1960s.

Goldwater was notably more conservative than previous Republican nominees, such as President Eisenhower.

Outside the South, Goldwater's negative vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign. The only other state he won was his home one of Arizona and he suffered a landslide defeat. A [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ad called \"[[Confessions of a Republican]]\", which ran in Northern and Western states, associated Goldwater with the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Johnson's campaign in the Deep South publicized Goldwater's support for pre-1964 civil rights legislation.

The Democratic Party factionalized, with each faction having the goal of taking over the entire statewide Byrd machine, but the Byrd leadership was basically conservative and more in line with the national Republican Party in economic and foreign policy issues.  Republicans united behind [[A. Linwood Holton, Jr.]] in 1969 and swept the state. In the [[1970 United States Senate elections|1970 Senate elections]], the Byrd machine made a comeback by electing Independent [[Harry Flood Byrd, Jr.]] over Republican [[Ray L. Garland]] and Democrat [[George Rawlings]]. The new Senator Byrd never joined the Republican Party and instead joined the Democratic caucus. Nevertheless, he had a mostly conservative voting record especially on the trademark Byrd issue of the national deficit. At the local level, the 1970s saw steady Republican growth with this emphasis on a middle-class suburban electorate that had little interest in the historic issues of rural agrarianism and racial segregation.<ref>James R.

One might say rather that it has become redundant. One of Lassiter's many fascinating demonstrations of racism's superfluousness is his recounting of the actual use of the \"southern strategy.\" The strategy obviously failed the Dixiecrats in l948 and the GOP in l964. The only time Nixon seriously tried to appeal to southern racism, in the l970 midterm elections, the South rejected his party and elected Democrats like Jimmy Carter and Dale Bumpers instead (pp. 264\u201374). To win a nationwide majority, Republicans and Democrats alike had to appeal to the broad middle-class privileges that most people believed they had earned. Lassiter suggests that the first step on the way out of hypersegregation and resegregation is to stop indulging in comforting narratives. The most comforting narratives attribute the whole problem to racists and the Republicans who appease them.}}</ref><ref name=\"Bulldozer\" />\n\nAccording to Lassiter, political scientists and historians point out, that the timing does not fit the \"Southern Strategy\" model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy. but the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire South for decades. Lassiter argues that Nixon's appeal was not to the Wallacites or segregationists, but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middle class. Many had Northern antecedents, wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest. Lassiter says the Southern Strategy was a \"failure\" for the GOP and that the Southern base of the Republican Party \"always depended more on the middle-class corporate economy and on the top-down politics of racial backlash\". Furthermore, realignment in the South \"came primarily from the suburban ethos of New South metropolises such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, not to the exportation of the working-class racial politics of the Black Belt\".<ref>Matthew D.

Kalk and Tindall emphasize the similarity between Nixon's operations and the series of compromises orchestrated by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1877 that ended the battles over Reconstruction and put Hayes in the White House. Kalk says Nixon did end the reform impulse and sowed the seeds for the political rise of white Southerners and the decline of the civil rights movement.<ref>Bruce H.

Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats.<ref name=\"Boyd\"/>}}\n\nWhile Phillips sought to increase Republican power by polarizing ethnic voting in general, and not just to win the white South, the South was by far the biggest prize yielded by his approach. Its success began at the presidential level. Gradually, Southern voters began to elect Republicans to Congress and finally to statewide and local offices, particularly as some legacy segregationist Democrats retired or switched to the GOP.{{Who|date=May 2018}} In addition, the Republican Party worked for years to develop [[grassroots]] political organizations across the South, supporting candidates for local school boards and city and county offices as examples, but following the [[Watergate scandal]] Southern voters came out in support for the \"favorite son\" candidate, Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nFrom 1948 to 1984, the Southern states, for decades a stronghold for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], became key [[swing state]]s, providing the popular vote margins in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] and [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 elections]]. During this era, several Republican candidates expressed support for [[states' rights]], a reversal of the position held by southern states prior to the Civil War. Some political analysts said this term was used in the 20th century as a \"code word\" to represent opposition to federal enforcement of civil rights for blacks and to federal intervention on their behalf; many individual southerners had opposed passage of the Voting Rights Act.<ref name=\"Branch\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===20th-century Reconstruction to Solid South===\n{{main|Reconstruction Era|Solid South}}\nDuring the Reconstruction era (1863\u20131877), the Republican Party built up its base across the South and for a while had control in each state except Virginia, but from a national perspective, the Republican Party always gave priority to its much better established Northern state operations. The Northern party distrusted the [[scalawag]]s, found the avaricious [[carpetbaggers]] distasteful and lacked respect for the black component of their Republican Party in the South.  Richard Abbott says that national Republicans always \"stressed building their Northern base rather than extending their party into the South, and whenever the Northern and Southern needs conflicted the latter always lost\".<ref>Richard H. Abbott, ''The Republican Party and the South, 1855\u20131877: The First Southern Strategy'' (1986)  p. 231</ref> In 1868, the GOP spent only 5% of its war chest in the South. [[Ulysses S.

Boris Heersink and Jeffery A. Jenkins argue that in 1880\u20131928 Republican leaders at the presidential level adopted a \"Southern Strategy\" by \"investing heavily in maintaining a minor party organization in the South, as a way to create a reliable voting base at conventions\". As a consequence, federal patronage did go to Southern blacks as long as there was a Republican in the White House. The issue exploded in 1912, when President [[William Howard Taft]] used control of the Southern delegations to defeat former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] at the Republican National Convention.<ref>Boris Heersink and Jeffery A.

Effectively, Southern white Democrats controlled all the votes of the expanded population by which Congressional apportionment was figured. Many of their representatives achieved powerful positions of seniority in Congress, giving them control of chairmanships of significant Congressional committees. Although the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] has a provision to reduce the Congressional representation of states that denied votes to their adult male citizens, this provision was never enforced. Because African Americans could not be voters, they were also prevented from being jurors and serving in local offices. Services and institutions for them in the segregated South were chronically underfunded by state and local governments, from which they were excluded.<ref name=\"Beginnings of black education\">[http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/education.htm \"Beginnings of black education\"], ''The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia.''

Between 1880 and 1904, Republican presidential candidates in the South received 35\u201340% of that section's vote (except in 1892, when the 16% for the Populists knocked Republicans down to 25%). From 1904 to 1948, Republicans received more than 30% of the section's votes only in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] (35.2%, carrying Tennessee) and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 elections]] (47.7%, carrying five states) after disenfranchisement.\n\nDuring this period, Republican administrations appointed blacks to political positions. Republicans regularly supported anti-[[lynching]] bills, but these were [[filibuster]]ed by Southern Democrats in the Senate. In the 1928 election, the Republican candidate [[Herbert Hoover]] rode the issues of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] and [[anti-Catholicism]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Ricky Floyd|title=Continuities in American anti-Catholicism: the Texas Baptist Standard and the coming of the 1960 election.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Continuities+in+American+anti-Catholicism:+the+Texas+Baptist+Standard...-a0162618834|newspaper=Baptist History and Heritage|date=January 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221202108/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/403.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> to carry five former Confederate states, with 62 of the 126 electoral votes of the section. After his victory, Hoover attempted to build up the Republican Party of the South, transferring his limited patronage away from blacks and toward the same kind of white Protestant businessmen who made up the core of the Northern Republican Party. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], which severely affected the South, Hoover soon became extremely unpopular. The gains of the Republican Party in the South were lost. In the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]], Hoover received only 18.1% of the Southern vote for re-election.\n\n===World War II and population changes===\nIn the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]], after President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]] to desegregate the military, a group of conservative Southern Democrats known as Dixiecrats split from the Democratic Party in reaction to the inclusion of a civil rights plank in the party's platform. This followed a floor fight led by civil-rights activist, [[Minneapolis]] Mayor (and soon-to-be [[United States Senate|Senator]]) [[Hubert Humphrey]]. The disaffected conservative Democrats formed the States' Rights Democratic, or [[Dixiecrat]] Party and nominated Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]] for President. Thurmond carried four Deep South states in the general election: [[South Carolina]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]. The main plank of the States' Rights Democratic Party was maintaining [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] in the South. The Dixiecrats, failing to deny the Democrats the presidency in 1948, soon dissolved, but the split lingered. In the fall of 1964, Thurmond was one of the first conservative Southern Democrats to switch to the Republican Party just a couple months after Democratic President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] into law.<ref name=\"Goldwater\">{{cite news|title=Thurmond to Bolt Democrats Today; South Carolinian Will Join G.O.P. and Aid Goldwater| newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 16, 1964 |page=12 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/09/16/98447784.pdf |quote=Both senators have opposed the Administration on such matters as civil rights...|accessdate=December 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Party of Civil Rights|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_05/023915.php|date=May 21, 2010|first=Steve|last=Benen|journal=[[Washington Monthly]]|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the splits in the Democratic Party, the population movements associated with [[World War II]] had a significant effect in changing the demographics of the South. Starting during World War II, lasting from 1940 to 1970, more than 5 million African-Americans moved from the rural South to medium and major [[Northern United States|Northern]] industrial cities as well as mainly coastal munitions centers of the [[Western United States|West]] during the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] for jobs in the defense industry and later economic opportunities during the post-World War II economic boom.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gregg|first1=Khyree|title=The Second Great Migration|url=http://www.inmotionaame.org/print.cfm;jsessionid=f830127271430904287014?migration=9&bhcp=1|website=inmotionaame|publisher=inmotionaame|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith control of powerful committees, Southern Democrats gained new federal military installations in the South and other federal investments during and after the war. Changes in industry and growth in universities and the military establishment in turn attracted Northern transplants to the South and bolstered the base of the Republican Party. In the post-war presidential campaigns, Republicans did best in those fastest-growing states of the South that had the most Northern transplants. In the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]], [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] and [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 elections]], [[Virginia]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]] went Republican while Louisiana went Republican in 1956 and [[Texas]] twice voted for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and once for [[John F. Kennedy]]. In 1956, Eisenhower received 48.9% of the Southern vote, becoming only the second Republican in history (after [[Ulysses S. Grant]]) to get a plurality of Southern votes.<ref>{{cite book|author=James L. Sundquist|title=Dynamics of the Party System: Alignment and Realignment of Political Parties in the United States|year=2011|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=285}}</ref>\n\nThe white conservative voters of the states of the Deep South remained loyal to the Democratic Party, which had not officially repudiated segregation. Because of declines in population or smaller rates of growth compared to other states, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and North Carolina lost congressional seats from the 1950s to the 1970s while South Carolina, Louisiana and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] remained static. Eisenhower was elected President in 1952, with strong support from the emerging middle class suburban element in the South.

Goldwater was notably more conservative than previous Republican nominees, such as President Eisenhower. Goldwater's principal opponent in the primary election, Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York, was widely seen as representing the more moderate, pro-Civil Rights Act, Northern wing of the party (see [[Rockefeller Republican]] and [[Goldwater Republican]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H Donaldson|title=Liberalism's Last Hurrah: The Presidential Campaign of 1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mTxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT27|year=2015|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=27|isbn=978-1317466093}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1964 presidential election, Goldwater ran a conservative campaign that broadly opposed strong action by the federal government.

Outside the South, Goldwater's negative vote on the Civil Rights Act proved devastating to his campaign. The only other state he won was his home one of Arizona and he suffered a landslide defeat. A [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ad called \"[[Confessions of a Republican]]\", which ran in Northern and Western states, associated Goldwater with the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Johnson's campaign in the Deep South publicized Goldwater's support for pre-1964 civil rights legislation. In the end, Johnson swept the election.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gregg|first1=Khyree|title=Election of 1964|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showelection.php?year=1964|website=American Presidency Project|publisher=American Presidency Project|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Goldwater was at odds in his position with most of the prominent members of the Republican Party, dominated by so-called Eastern Establishment and Midwestern Progressives. A higher percentage of the Republicans and Democrats outside the South supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as they had on all previous Civil Rights legislation. The [[Southern Democrats]] mostly opposed the Northern and Western politicians regardless of party affiliation\u2014and their Presidents (Kennedy and Johnson)\u2014on civil rights issues. At the same time, passage of the Civil Rights Act caused many black voters to join the Democratic Party, which moved the party and its nominees in a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] direction.<ref name=rutenberg>{{cite news|last1=Rutenberg|first1=Jim|title=A Dream Undone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/magazine/voting-rights-act-dream-undone.html|accessdate=29 July 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nJohnson was concerned that his endorsement of Civil Rights legislation would endanger his party in the South. In the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]], [[Richard Nixon]] saw the cracks in the [[Solid South]] as an opportunity to tap into a group of voters who had historically been beyond the reach of the Republican Party.

The strategy involved depicting Democratic candidates as permissive liberals. Republicans thereby managed to unseat [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] of Tennessee as well as Senator [[Joseph D.

The Democratic Party factionalized, with each faction having the goal of taking over the entire statewide Byrd machine, but the Byrd leadership was basically conservative and more in line with the national Republican Party in economic and foreign policy issues.  Republicans united behind [[A. Linwood Holton, Jr.]] in 1969 and swept the state. In the [[1970 United States Senate elections|1970 Senate elections]], the Byrd machine made a comeback by electing Independent [[Harry Flood Byrd, Jr.]] over Republican [[Ray L. Garland]] and Democrat [[George Rawlings]]. The new Senator Byrd never joined the Republican Party and instead joined the Democratic caucus. Nevertheless, he had a mostly conservative voting record especially on the trademark Byrd issue of the national deficit. At the local level, the 1970s saw steady Republican growth with this emphasis on a middle-class suburban electorate that had little interest in the historic issues of rural agrarianism and racial segregation.<ref>James R.

Cliches like \"white backlash\" and \"southern strategy\" are inadequate to explain the conservative turn in post-1960s politics. ... Racism has not been overcome. One might say rather that it has become redundant. One of Lassiter's many fascinating demonstrations of racism's superfluousness is his recounting of the actual use of the \"southern strategy.\" The strategy obviously failed the Dixiecrats in l948 and the GOP in l964. The only time Nixon seriously tried to appeal to southern racism, in the l970 midterm elections, the South rejected his party and elected Democrats like Jimmy Carter and Dale Bumpers instead (pp. 264\u201374). To win a nationwide majority, Republicans and Democrats alike had to appeal to the broad middle-class privileges that most people believed they had earned. Lassiter suggests that the first step on the way out of hypersegregation and resegregation is to stop indulging in comforting narratives. The most comforting narratives attribute the whole problem to racists and the Republicans who appease them.}}</ref><ref name=\"Bulldozer\" />\n\nAccording to Lassiter, political scientists and historians point out, that the timing does not fit the \"Southern Strategy\" model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy. but the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire South for decades. Lassiter argues that Nixon's appeal was not to the Wallacites or segregationists, but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middle class. Many had Northern antecedents, wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest. Lassiter says the Southern Strategy was a \"failure\" for the GOP and that the Southern base of the Republican Party \"always depended more on the middle-class corporate economy and on the top-down politics of racial backlash\". Furthermore, realignment in the South \"came primarily from the suburban ethos of New South metropolises such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, not to the exportation of the working-class racial politics of the Black Belt\".<ref>Matthew D.

Kalk and Tindall emphasize the similarity between Nixon's operations and the series of compromises orchestrated by [[Rutherford B.

However, he notes that Lassiter's dissenting view on this subject, a view that the realignment was a \"suburban strategy\" rather than a \"Southern Strategy\", was just one of the first of a rapidly growing list of scholars who see the civil rights \"white backlash\" as a secondary or minor factor. Authors such as Tim Boyd, George Lewis, Michael Bowen and John W. White follow the lead of Lassiter, Shafer and Johnston in viewing suburban voters and their self interests as the primary reason for the realignment. He does not discount race as part of the motivation of these suburban voters who were fleeing urban crime and school busing.<ref name=Feldman>{{cite book|last1=Feldman|first1=Glenn|title=Painting Dixie Red: When, Where, Why and How the South Became Republican|date=2011|publisher=University Press of Florida|pages=16, 80}}</ref>\n\nGareth Davies argues that \"[t]he scholarship of those who emphasize the southern strategizing Nixon is not so much wrong\u2014it captures one side of the man\u2014as it is unsophisticated and incomplete.

Others claim that he failed, by orchestrating a politically expedient surrender to de facto school segregation. A close examination of the evidence, however, reveals that in the area of school desegregation, Nixon's record was a mixture of principle and politics, progress and paralysis, success and failure. In the end, he was neither simply the cowardly architect of a racially insensitive \"Southern strategy\" which condoned segregation, nor the courageous conductor of a politically risky \"not-so-Southern strategy\" which condemned it.<ref>Lawrence J.
