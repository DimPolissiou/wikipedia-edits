The film stars [[Ajay Devgn]], with [[Twinkle Khanna]], [[Amrish Puri]], [[Shakti Kapoor]] and [[Suresh Oberoi]]. It was theatrically released in [[United States]] on 31 March 1996 and [[India]] as well as other countries on 17 May 1996. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Anand&ndash;Milind]].

The film was declared a super hit at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nPolice Commissioner Suryadev Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]) looks after his granddaughter Kajal ([[Twinkle Khanna]]) after her parents were poisoned by his enemies. Suryadev's cousin Vishambar ([[Suresh Oberoi]]) is plotting the complete ruin of Suryadev, along with wife and brother in-law Bhanwari ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), because Vishambar's late father had given Vishambar's share of property, including a village Sundernagar, to Suryadev as Vishambar has married someone against his wishes. Vishambar plans to kill Kajal to avenge himself and with Kajal gone, his son Nagendra can inherit the property. Vishambar hires Karan ([[Ajay Devgn]]) for this, a young man in need of money for treating his ailing mother in hospital. By rescuing Kajal in a fake kidnapping drama enacted by Vishambar's goons, he wins Suryadev's confidence. Suryadev then decides to send Kajal to his village to stay with some relatives, along with Karan as her bodyguard, convinced that he will protect her.\n\nIn the village, Kajal falls in love with Karan, but he does not reciprocate. He even tries to kill her on many occasions, but hesitates for some reason. Finally he decides to tell her everything, but Kajal refuses to listen. She woos him till he finally falls for her. Interspersed between all this is [[Johnny Lever]] and his girlfriend with their hilarious acts.\n\nIn the meantime, Vishambar gets to know that Karan has fallen for Kajal, and hires another killer, Dilavar to eliminate both of them. Kajal is kidnapped, and Karan rescues her and kills Dilavar.\n\nSuryadev arrives at the village on hearing of the disappearance of Kajal and Karan, and gets to know of Karan's real motive because of a note written by Karan meant for Kajal to read, before he falls for her, left in his room. He then orders Karan's arrest. He finds his granddaughter with Karan, but she refuses to let him harm the latter, and both elope again. Karan and Kajal are finally apprehended. Karan is arrested and tortured, but he does not reveal who actually hired him to kill Kajal, for fear that his mother would be affected.\n\nSuryadev then arranges for his granddaughter to be married to Rohit, son of his longtime friend. She agrees to the marriage, but on the condition that Karan will be released from jail, to which Suryadev agrees.\n\nKaran learns about Kajal's wedding plans and leaves enraged, to rescue his mother. Rohit is kidnapped by Bhanwari, and Karan is called to kill Rohit at their hideout if he wants his mother back. Karan goes and rescues Rohit and his mother, killing the goons. But Suryadev thinks Karan is behind the kidnapping, and gives orders for him to be shot at sight.\n\nKaran arrives at the wedding scene with Rohit and explains everything and insists that Rohit marry Kajal. Vishambar, present at the scene, gets to know of what has happened to his household when he receives a phone call from a dying Bhanwari, and enraged, snatches a machine gun and fires indiscriminately as Rohit is being married to Kajal, but Karan fights Vishambar and kills him.\n\nAs the police take Karan away, Suryadev promises him a quick return from jail and marriage with Kajal.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as Karan\n* [[Twinkle Khanna]] as Kajal\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as Commissioner Suryadev Singh\n* [[Rakhi Gulzar]] as Rukmini\n* [[Aruna Irani]] as Karan's mother\n* [[Suresh Oberoi]] as Vishambar\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as Bhanwari\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Damru\n* [[Vivek Mushran]] as Rohit\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as Nagendra\n\n==Soundtrack==\nAll music was composed by [[Anand-Milind]].
