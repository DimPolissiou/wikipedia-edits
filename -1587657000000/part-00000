He is also the most [[cap (football)|capped]] player for the Denmark national team, with 129 games between 1987 and 2001. In addition to Euro 92, he played for his country at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and three additional [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] tournaments. He captained the national team in 30 matches. He also represented Gladsaxe Hero, [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]], [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]], [[Sporting CP]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a career that lasted from 1981 until 2003 and yielded 24 trophies.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all-time, the [[IFFHS]] ranked Schmeichel among the top ten [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper#Goalkeeper of the Century|keepers of the 20th century]] in 2000,<ref name=\"IFFHS' Century Elections\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html#worldkoc |title=IFFHS' Century Elections |accessdate=21 June 2007 |first=Karel |last=Stokkermans |date=30 January 2000 |work=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] }}</ref> and in 2001, Schmeichel won a public poll held by [[Reuters]], when the majority of the 200,000 participants voted him as the best goalkeeper ever, ahead of [[Lev Yashin]] and [[Gordon Banks]].<ref name=\"showstars\">{{cite web |url=http://www.showstars.dk/query:invoke/method:display/folderid:3216/lang:da/ |title=PETER SCHMEICHEL |accessdate=21 June 2007 |work=ShowStars.dk |language=Danish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704194758/http://www.showstars.dk/query:invoke/method:display/folderid:3216/lang:da/ |archivedate=4 July 2007}}</ref> In 2003, Schmeichel was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his impact on the English game. In March 2004, he was named as one of the \"125 greatest living footballers\", at the [[FIFA 100]] celebrations. His son, [[Kasper Schmeichel|Kasper]], is also a professional goalkeeper, currently playing for Premier League side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPeter Schmeichel was born in the [[S\u00f8borgg\u00e5rd]] parish of [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, to Inger, a Danish nurse, and Antoni Schmeichel, a [[Polish people|Polish]] jazz musician. He held Polish [[citizen]]ship until 1970 when he, his father, and his three sisters became Danish citizens.\n\nSchmeichel inherited his middle name \u2013 Boles\u0142aw \u2013 from his great-grandfather.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 25</ref> He spent his early years in the town of [[Buddinge]], [[Copenhagen]], and began his football career playing for a team in the adjacent suburb of [[H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe]]. His first match came on 7 August 1972 at the age of 8.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 29</ref> After a two-and-a-half-year unbeaten run, Schmeichel was approached by BK Hero, a team from a few divisions above H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe and with one of the largest youth football schemes in Denmark. BK Hero merged with Gladsaxe BK in 1979 to form [[Gladsaxe-Hero BK]], and Schmeichel was presented with the opportunity to play for the [[Zealand Football Association|Zealand FA's]] junior representative team.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nEventually graduating to the Gladsaxe-Hero senior squad, Schmeichel met his first mentor in [[Svend Aage Hansen]], the first team coach at the club, and later to become his father-in-law. With Gladsaxe-Hero already relegated from the Danish Third Division with three games to go, Hansen promoted Schmeichel and six others from the youth team for a match against [[IF Skjold Birker\u00f8d]]. The team lost 1\u20130, but Schmeichel received mentions in local newspapers for his personal performance.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 31</ref> At the end of the season, Hansen explained to Schmeichel his plan for the future, which involved Schmeichel spending two more seasons with Gladsaxe-Hero BK before moving on to [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]], playing for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and eventually having a successful career abroad. Schmeichel admits that he had received an offer to play for [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]'s youth team, but he turned it down as the club \"seemed a bit boring\".<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nThe following season Gladsaxe-Hero needed only to avoid defeat to Stubbek\u00f8bing to prevent relegation from the Danish National League. In the end, Schmeichel played one of the best games of his career and Gladsaxe-Hero won the match. At the end of the game, Hansen's daughter, Bente, ran onto the pitch and hugged Schmeichel. The two ended up going out as a couple, and they eventually got married.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nBefore becoming a professional footballer, Schmeichel had to work a number of jobs to make ends meet. His first job came in the dyeing department of a textile factory, but safety concerns led to his resignation. He then spent 12 months as a cleaner at an old people's home, before taking up an office job with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]]. He originally worked in the organisation's shops, but three weeks after he joined, the store manager left and Schmeichel was promoted to the position of sales manager. Soon after, Schmeichel was called upon to do his four weeks of compulsory military service. However, this coincided with Hvidovre's summer training camp in Portugal, which he was permitted to go on with the proviso that he completed his military service the following month. Nevertheless, the delicate organisational situation that arose between the WWF, the Danish defence department and Hvidovre prompted Schmeichel to give up working for the WWF. A job with his father-in-law's flooring firm came next, until he realised that his knees could not support his {{convert|15|stone|kg}} frame for eight hours a day, and he was offered a job with the advertising firm owned by Hvidovre's chairman, Niels Erik Madsen. This was to be his last job outside football, as he was offered a contract with [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] the following spring.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\n===Professional career===\n\n====Br\u00f8ndby (1987\u20131991)====\nDespite the fifth best defence in the league, conceding 40 goals in 30 games,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |title=Danmarksturneringen 1985 |accessdate=21 June 2007 |first=Peder I. |last=Nielsen |year=1999 |publisher=Peders Fodboldstatistik |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316190707/http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Schmeichel and Hvidovre finished in 14th place and were [[relegated]] in 1985. After only a single season, the club bounced right back to the 1st Division, but Schmeichel was lost by Hvidovre to Danish runners-up [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]] before the 1987 season. Winning the Danish league in his first year, he joined a club which he helped turn into a success. He made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1987, under national manager [[Sepp Piontek]], and was selected for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 88]] tournament, where he eventually became Denmark's starting goalkeeper, after initially serving as a back-up to [[Troels Rasmussen]] in Denmark's opening 3\u20132 defeat to [[Spain national football team|Spain]]; Denmark lost both of their remaining two matches 2\u20130 to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]], however, and were eliminated in the first round of the competition.<ref name=\"Honours\"/>\n\nIn all, Schmeichel and Br\u00f8ndby won four championships in five seasons.

Indeed, in a 2001 Reuters poll, he beat Lev Yashin and Gordon Banks to be named the finest keeper in football history. Despite being a goalkeeper, he would run into the attack on corner kicks if his team was behind. The sight of him going up for the corner was a great distraction to opposing defenders. He scored a goal in this fashion, for Man United, in a [[1995\u201396 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] match against [[Rotor Volgograd]] at Old Trafford in September 1995.

In March 2004, he was named as one of the \"125 greatest living footballers\", at the [[FIFA 100]] celebrations. His son, [[Kasper Schmeichel|Kasper]], is also a professional goalkeeper, currently playing for Premier League side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nPeter Schmeichel was born in the [[S\u00f8borgg\u00e5rd]] parish of [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, to Inger, a Danish nurse, and Antoni Schmeichel, a [[Polish people|Polish]] jazz musician. He held Polish [[citizen]]ship until 1970 when he, his father, and his three sisters became Danish citizens.\n\nSchmeichel inherited his middle name \u2013 Boles\u0142aw \u2013 from his great-grandfather.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 25</ref> He spent his early years in the town of [[Buddinge]], [[Copenhagen]], and began his football career playing for a team in the adjacent suburb of [[H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe]]. His first match came on 7 August 1972 at the age of 8.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 29</ref> After a two-and-a-half-year unbeaten run, Schmeichel was approached by BK Hero, a team from a few divisions above H\u00f8je-Gladsaxe and with one of the largest youth football schemes in Denmark. BK Hero merged with Gladsaxe BK in 1979 to form [[Gladsaxe-Hero BK]], and Schmeichel was presented with the opportunity to play for the [[Zealand Football Association|Zealand FA's]] junior representative team.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nEventually graduating to the Gladsaxe-Hero senior squad, Schmeichel met his first mentor in [[Svend Aage Hansen]], the first team coach at the club, and later to become his father-in-law. With Gladsaxe-Hero already relegated from the Danish Third Division with three games to go, Hansen promoted Schmeichel and six others from the youth team for a match against [[IF Skjold Birker\u00f8d]]. The team lost 1\u20130, but Schmeichel received mentions in local newspapers for his personal performance.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), p. 31</ref> At the end of the season, Hansen explained to Schmeichel his plan for the future, which involved Schmeichel spending two more seasons with Gladsaxe-Hero BK before moving on to [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]], playing for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and eventually having a successful career abroad. Schmeichel admits that he had received an offer to play for [[Boldklubben 1903|B 1903]]'s youth team, but he turned it down as the club \"seemed a bit boring\".<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nThe following season Gladsaxe-Hero needed only to avoid defeat to Stubbek\u00f8bing to prevent relegation from the Danish National League. In the end, Schmeichel played one of the best games of his career and Gladsaxe-Hero won the match. At the end of the game, Hansen's daughter, Bente, ran onto the pitch and hugged Schmeichel. The two ended up going out as a couple, and they eventually got married.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nBefore becoming a professional footballer, Schmeichel had to work a number of jobs to make ends meet. His first job came in the dyeing department of a textile factory, but safety concerns led to his resignation. He then spent 12 months as a cleaner at an old people's home, before taking up an office job with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]]. He originally worked in the organisation's shops, but three weeks after he joined, the store manager left and Schmeichel was promoted to the position of sales manager. Soon after, Schmeichel was called upon to do his four weeks of compulsory military service. However, this coincided with Hvidovre's summer training camp in Portugal, which he was permitted to go on with the proviso that he completed his military service the following month. Nevertheless, the delicate organisational situation that arose between the WWF, the Danish defence department and Hvidovre prompted Schmeichel to give up working for the WWF. A job with his father-in-law's flooring firm came next, until he realised that his knees could not support his {{convert|15|stone|kg}} frame for eight hours a day, and he was offered a job with the advertising firm owned by Hvidovre's chairman, Niels Erik Madsen. This was to be his last job outside football, as he was offered a contract with [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] the following spring.<ref>Schmeichel (2000), pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\n===Professional career===\n\n====Br\u00f8ndby (1987\u20131991)====\nDespite the fifth best defence in the league, conceding 40 goals in 30 games,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |title=Danmarksturneringen 1985 |accessdate=21 June 2007 |first=Peder I. |last=Nielsen |year=1999 |publisher=Peders Fodboldstatistik |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316190707/http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/Danmarksturneringen/1985.htm |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Schmeichel and Hvidovre finished in 14th place and were [[relegated]] in 1985.

Winning the Danish league in his first year, he joined a club which he helped turn into a success. He made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1987, under national manager [[Sepp Piontek]], and was selected for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 88]] tournament, where he eventually became Denmark's starting goalkeeper, after initially serving as a back-up to [[Troels Rasmussen]] in Denmark's opening 3\u20132 defeat to [[Spain national football team|Spain]]; Denmark lost both of their remaining two matches 2\u20130 to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]], however, and were eliminated in the first round of the competition.<ref name=\"Honours\"/>\n\nIn all, Schmeichel and Br\u00f8ndby won four championships in five seasons.

However, he still works occasionally as a pundit for the [[BBC]].\n\nHis popularity in Britain is perhaps best measured by [[Chesney Brown]] on the [[Manchester]]-based soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', naming his former dog (a [[Great Dane]]) \"Schmeichel\".\n\nHe also took part in [[Soccer Aid]], and played for the Rest of the World team, who lost 2\u20131 after he was substituted at half-time. Schmeichel was a contestant on the 2006 series of the [[BBC]]'s popular Saturday night TV programme ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', but was voted out by the public on his 43rd birthday. He also appeared on ''[[The Weakest Link]]'' in the UK, but he was voted off as the weakest link in the first round.\n\nOn 31 August 2007, an investor group including Schmeichel announced their intention to invest 250 million DKK ([[Euro|\u20ac]]33.5 million) in the football club [[Br\u00f8ndby IF]] and make him sports director.

The Group's roots are traced back to the [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]], established in 1844.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/| publisher=The Co-operative Group}}</ref> The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was based on the [[Rochdale Principles]] \u2013 which notably introduced the idea of distributing a share of profits according to purchases through a scheme which became to be known as \"the divi\".\n\n[[File:Co-op poster, Town, Beamish Museum, 26 November 2006 (1).jpg|thumb|An advert for CWS candles]]\nAlthough the Co-operative Group incorporates the original Rochdale Society, the business' core for much of its history were its wholesale operations. This began in 1863 when the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited was launched in [[Manchester]] by 300 individual co-operatives in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. By 1872, it was known as the 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|title=1862|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205339/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\">Wilson, J.

It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in [[Leeds]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bristol]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Huddersfield]] alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits ([[Manchester]]), boots ([[Leicester]]), soap ([[Durham, England|Durham]]) and textiles ([[Batley]]). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from [[Goole]] docks to parts of continental [[Europe]]. One of the CWS' steamships, the ''Pioneer'', was the first commercial vessel to use the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of [[World War I]] the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a [[tea]] plantation in India.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n[[File:Co-op land, Manchester 1995.jpg|thumb|The head offices for the Co-operative Bank and the CIS in [[Manchester]]'s 'co-op quarter']]\nThere was a great deal of consideration on the role of the CWS in the British co-operative movement around the turn of the twentieth century. Many, fiercely local, societies saw the CWS as a valuable supplier but did not want to exclusively purchase produce from them owing to perceptions of high cost (mostly transport costs) and unreliable quality \u2013 some things the CWS were at pains to resolve. In contrast to this, the CWS had its aim to be the centrepoint for the whole co-operative movement in the UK and lobbied hard for loyalty from co-ops. To this end, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to [[The Co-operative Bank]], financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the [[Co-operative Insurance|Co-operative Insurance Society]] in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing [[Co-operative Legal Services|legal services]] \u2013 all businesses which form parts of the Co-operative Group today. It was hoped that these financial ties, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===WWII and post-war decline (1939\u20131989)===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[rationing]] led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods.\n\nDuring this time, the CWS began planning for the future, as even then they could see the potential disruption to the retail market that the new multiple grocers could have. What was less obvious at the time would be the impact of [[National Savings]] and national taxation on the movement, as Britain shifted from a country of friendly, building and co-operative societies, to one with a National Health Service, National House building programs and National Post Office Bank [[NS&I]][[General Post Office|GPO]]. In 1944, the CWS published a report entitled ''Policy and Programme for Post War Development'' which focused on methods for revitalising the co-op movement after the war had ended. The report suggested merging the CWS with the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS); reducing the number of co-operative societies through merger; moving into the manufacturing and production of [[white goods]] and the expansion of [[the Co-operative Bank]].\n\nThis report received much criticism from the fiercely local co-operative societies and the proposals of the report were only partly and slowly implemented. The end of war allowed some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores around this time, while the slow demobilisation of the wartime boost of full employment and high wages partly waned consumer spending power. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first self-service shop in 1942, the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|title=1901\u20131950|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104185939/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Despite this the subscribed share capital (risk capital) available to societies to innovate and take risks dwindled causing market share and relative quality of the service societies could offer their members to dwindle. Consequently, this impacted the movement by reducing the number of society members willing to enter membership and then actively trade with their co-operatives, leading to further real terms falls in withdraw-able member share capital levels, and in the level or return generated co-operative investment in the form of lower interest and dividends. A corollary of falling market share was continued ownership of freehold land, property and infrastructure, such as warehouses, dairies and farmland (the [[Co-operative Farms]]) built up by societies with accumulated surpluses from the 50 years of growth before the war.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nThe Co-operative Independent Commission (1958) was tasked with investigating the decline in the co-op movement and for making recommendations for revitalising the movement in the future. Its recommendations had two main thrusts: that a strong response to the emerging multiple-store supermarket chains (including the appointment of professional managers)<ref name=myners /> was needed and that the Co-op needed to come to terms with the rise in consumerism and to move away from its association with the \"working poor\" rather than a more prosperous working class.\n\nThis was not to say that the Co-op had not been modernising, notably through opening self-service stores and supermarkets. However, the report suggested that the Co-op needed to become more responsive to the grocery market by being more competitive on price, by rationalising on unprofitable stores and by recruiting professional managers. The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the [[The Co-operative brand|first national co-operative branding]], the 'Co-op' cloverleaf.\n\nThough Operation Facelift led to some improvements, the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing a downward trend.<ref name=myners /> Again, it was suggested that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through enhanced economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or were absorbed into either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable, and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.\n\nThe merger did highlight the potential of The Co-operative Bank as it was building a sizeable base of customers (notably local authorities, mutuals and local groups alongside co-operative societies) and this became an increasingly significant proportion of the CWS's annual profits. The growth in the bank largely related to its aggressive expansion into the [[personal banking]] market and with the pioneering of free banking (1972) in the UK, nine years before any of its larger rivals.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n[[File:1996 - Co-op Lisburn Road store, Belfast (12541793775).jpg|thumb|The Co-op superstore Lisburn Road, [[Belfast]], shown here in 1996.]]\n\nThe co-operative movement's marketshare and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 1980s, in part, due to a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the process of [[de-industrialisation]], that had characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands (notably the northern industrial towns), which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in overall consumer disposable income. This was largely due to the strong increase in wealth and social inequality in the UK at this time. The co-operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and The Co-op's historic association as the shop for the \"working poor\".\n\nSecondly, redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing (which featured co-op stores dotted throughout) to newer purpose-built estates, with around 18,000 co-op stores closing as they had become redundant.\n\nThirdly, the time was a period of notable [[inflation]] and a strong pound, which had led to a wave of cheap imported goods \u2013 this devastated much of the UK's manufacturing industries (including the CWS). By the 1980s, it became clear that the trend in the retail sector was towards large (often out of town) supermarkets and [[hypermarkets]] with hundreds of them appearing across the UK.\n\nThe co-operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness. In an attempt to improve the collective buying power of the movement the CWS acted to reposition itself from a wholesaler (from which societies can choose to buy) to a 'buying group' (where the CWS buys on behalf of), in order that CWS could increase the proportion of produce sold through co-operative stores that was sourced by itself. Though this did work to increase loyalty, it was not until the 2000s with the development of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group]] that the CWS became the ''[[de facto]]'' wholesaler for co-operative stores.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nDuring the 1980s, the CWS began to merge with a number of failing co-operative societies, having returned to direct retailing after its merger with the SCWS the decade before. These mergers with consumers' co-operatives led to the co-op having both corporate (co-op societies) and individual members, hence making it both a primary and [[secondary co-operative]].<ref name=\"myners\"/> The CWS's expansion into direct retailing (especially after the mergers of the 2000s) led to the CWS becoming a highly visible business in the UK. The legacy of this was that many people perceive the British co-operative movement to be one business, The Co-operative Group, or co-op for short.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===Modernisation and takeover attempts (1990\u20131999)===\nBy the start of the 1990s, the co-operative movement's share of the UK grocery market had declined to the point where the entire business model was in question. This was at a time when many [[building society|building societies]] were demutualising as many of the public preferred the short-term financial gain of the windfall payment over the perceived lack of benefits from the mutual model. For a time it seemed as though the mutual or co-op model was almost dead.\n\nThe Co-op's reputation was not helped in this respect by the factions within the movement, notably the strong rivalry between the [[Co-operative Retail Services|CRS]] and the CWS, acting in a manner which exacerbated the belief held by many members of the public that, rather than working for the interests of all members, co-ops were largely acting in the self-interests of a dominant 'clique' of members within each society.\n\nTogether these crises meant that the 1990s would become a crucial decade if the Co-op was to survive. In order to raise capital to invest in its food stores (and also the increasingly successful Co-operative Bank), the CWS sold many of its factories to [[Andrew Regan]] in 1994 for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]111 million in what initially appeared to be a highly beneficial arrangement for the CWS.\n\nHowever, later it appeared that those involved in this deal did so without the CWS Board's permission and had been also handing confidential CWS files to Regan. Notably, one Sunday newspaper printed the CWS' annual report before it had been officially released. This would later pose a huge threat to the CWS when in 1997 Regan posed a highly ambitious \u00a31.2bn hostile takeover attempt of the CWS.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/coop-rejects-regans-advance-1271324.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Co-op rejects Regan's advance | author=Nigel Cope\n|date=6 March 1997 }}</ref> This shocked many in the movement and consolidated support for the CWS as the 'linchpin' of the movement in a way that many had previous opposed.\n\nThe CWS, under the leadership of Graham Melmoth, was able to defend itself from this takeover bid, largely by informing Regan's creditors that his hostile takeover was based upon dubiously sourced data and bad business practices. The deal also failed because Regan had greatly misunderstood the CWS' complicated ownership structure, assuming that by paying off the 500,000 'active members' he could gain control of the CWS.\n\nThough this strategy worked for the [[carpetbagger#United Kingdom|carpetbaggers]] working to demutualise UK building societies at the time, it failed to recognise that the ownership actually lay with millions of ordinary members and that many of these 'active members' were staunch co-operators and who would be unlikely to back the bid.\n\nAfter investigations by a private detective and a subsequent criminal court case, Regan's bid was rejected and two senior CWS executives were dismissed and imprisoned for fraud. An arrest warrant was issued for Andrew Regan in 1999 however he had already emigrated to [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/34792/news/consumer/regan039s-out-court-settlement-co-op-group/|title=Regan's out-of-court settlement with Co-op Group|author=Co-operative News|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=18 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe shock that Regan's bid sent through the co-operative movement has been attributed with sowing the seeds for the reduced hostilities between the CWS and CRS factions which eventually ended with the CRS becoming a member of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group|CRTG]] before fully merging with the CWS in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/670302.stm |title=Co-op merger approved |publisher=BBC |date=8 March 2000 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> The merger took two years to complete and the launch of the newly combined business, named The Co-operative Group, was timed with the release of the 2001 [[Co-operative Commission]] report, chaired by [[John Monks]], which proposed a strategy of modernisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.coop/newsroom/ten-years-co-operative-commission|title=Blog: Ten Years from the Co-operative Commission \u2013 Co-operatives UK Newsroom|work=uk.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe report focused on improving store design and building a consistent [[The Co-operative brand|branding]] whilst also driving for efficiency savings to make the food business more competitive \u2013 the similarity in conclusions between the 1919, 1958 and 2001 reports highlights the distinct lack of progress within the movement during this time. The 2001 report also highlighted the need to market what it called 'The Co-operative Advantage'; a favourite idea of Graham Melmoth, which suggested that commercial success would provide the funding for the social goals of the movement which (when the public saw a tangible benefit to their own lives) would provide a competitive advantage to the Co-op which would further its commercial success \u2013 a virtuous cycle. Unlike Gaitskell Commission's 1958 report the recommendations of the report, notably the major update to \"The Co-operative brand\" and the re-launch of the membership dividend scheme, were largely adopted by the co-operative movement including The Co-operative Group. These changes to the business are largely credited with the successes in profitability and the achievement in social goals which improved in the years after the Co-operative Commission report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-date=31 October 2007|website=Co-operatives UK|date=13 June 2005|title=Commission Paves the Way for Co-operative Success}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the CWS-CRS merger, new governance arrangements were designed with the 'independent societies' becoming part owners of the new Group and their representatives were elected to the group's national board. The largest change, however, was the much stronger representation for the individual members of the retailing operation with a string of regional boards and area committees designed to facilitate a clear democracy and representation on a local and national level. The composite nature of the Co-op as both a primary and a [[secondary co-operative]] led to the business having both individual members and corporate members (independent co-operative societies) which had to be included in any democratic structure. This led to a governance arrangement which was complicated and not understood by many individual members and which led to relatively few members becoming democratically engaged with the business. During 2007 the then chief executive Martin Beaumont was critical of the lack of commercial expertise on the board, foreshadowing the conclusions drawn from later Myners review into the near failure of the business during 2013 which was (in part) due to an unfit governance arrangement.<ref name=myners /> In 2014 the governance arrangements were completely redesigned to reflect the recommendations of the Myners review \u2013 for more information see the [[The Co-operative Group#Governance|governance section]].\n\n====Establishing the \"Co-operative difference\"====\nThough the modernisation of the business was most noticeable after the 1997 takeover attempt, this is not to say that modernisation of the CWS had not been under way for some time. Since 1993 the CRTG had been working to switch the role of the CWS from \"selling to\" to \"buying for\" co-operative societies as a way of maximising the economies of scale to become more competitive to the major supermarkets. Since the 1960s the Co-op had been following retail trends after they had occurred, always having to catch up, in a way that it led the changes before the Second World War. Many leaders within the movement began to appreciate that this 'me too' approach to retailing was not working, for example, expanding into [[hypermarkets]] after [[Tesco]] and [[Sainsbury's]] had already developed a dominant position, but without the resources to compete on price. After the 1997 strategic review the business suggested that it close the majority of its [[hypermarkets]] and [[department stores]] and instead focus on its core chain of [[convenience store]]s.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nAs a further attempt to differentiate itself from its larger competitors The Co-operative Bank had introduced an ethical policy in 1992 and this, along with its technical innovation, was well received with customers. The CWS decided that, though it had always aimed to trade responsibly (for example though the working conditions in its factories and plantations as well as its boycott of South African produce during the years of [[Apartheid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/40332/news/social-enterprise/my-story-how-co-operators-led-south-african-boycott-support-mandela/|title=My story: How co-operators led a South African boycott in support of Mandela|author=Elaine Dean|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=12 December 2013}}</ref>), by cementing its \"ethical\" credentials in a series of strong and clear policy commitments it could work to convince the public of the \"co-operative difference\".\n\nThis move posed a bold step for the CWS leadership as this was a wholly new approach for such a large business. As a part of this, the Co-op worked with [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] to help introduce the [[Fairtrade Mark]] in the UK. It was an early adopter of the [[RSPCA]]'s 'Freedom Foods' animal welfare certification. It introduced the first supermarket range of 'environmentally friendly' household products and the first range of toiletries certified by [[Cruelty Free International]] as \"not tested on animals\".\n\nThis new adoption of an ethical strategy was only part of the CWS' changes. The Co-op had been pioneering on notable changes to its packaging with nutritional labelling on food (1985) and later introduced [[Braille]] on its packaging. Many [[own brand]] products were also reformulated to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and fat in order to make the product range more healthy. So successful was this initiative that competitors such as Sainsbury's and [[Marks and Spencer]] began to follow aggressively on these initiatives.\n[[File:Co-op shop - geograph.org.uk - 593466.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Co-Op Welcome' branding from [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]]]\n\n[[File:Co-op Store at Warwickgates - geograph.org.uk - 1098934.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Late Shop' branding on the co-op store in [[Whitnash]]]]\nIn an attempt to build upon the success which was being felt around the increasing public perception of the co-op as an ethical retailer and to implement what was a core recommendation of the 2001 Co-operatives Commission, The Co-operative Group launched a brand panel which was tasked with developing a single consistent national branding standard for the movement. For decades, marketing by co-operatives was confusing for many customers with different societies adopting different store names (notably \"Co-op Welcome\" and \"Co-op Late Shop\"), various shop fascia designs and inconsistent marketing. Also, the cloverleaf design of the Co-op logo was seen by many as too associated with the years of neglect and decline within the movement and hence The Co-operative Group aimed to launch a totally new brand.\n\nThe new \"[[The Co-operative brand|The Co-operative]]\" branding was first displayed at the 2005 co-operative congress and became the first brand which could bring together all of the co-operative businesses (both those of The Group and the independent societies) under a single consistent brand. With the brand came a set of standards which any outlet using the brand must adhere to \u2013 to maintain a high standard of impression with customers. A twelve-month pilot of the new branding followed and these suggested that a significant growth in sales followed the re-branding of stores, largely understood to result from a major impact on public perceptions. Not all of the independent societies joined this new branding however, with [[United Co-operatives]] (prior to its merger with the Co-operative Group), the [[Scottish Midland Co-operative Society]] and the [[Lincolnshire Co-operative Society]] not adopting the new brand design. In combination with the new \"The Co-operative\" redesign, the Co-op sought to relaunch the co-operative membership scheme using a single consistent national standard and featuring the re-introduction of the member dividend.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nTogether, this renewed focus on responsible trading, the redesign of \"The Co-operative\" brand and the reintroduction of the member dividend helped to build the start of a renewed relationship with the British public. In 2006 a survey found the Co-op to be the most trusted major retailer in the UK and almost six million people joined the membership scheme over the following five years. Even after The Co-operative Group's financial crisis of 2013 the 'Have Your Say' survey found that more than 70% of the public agreed that the Co-op 'tries to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion (2000\u20132012)===\n[[File:VG Grocers Logo FAIR USE ONLY.jpg|thumb|180px|The VG logo and shop livery, c. 1990]]\nFollowing the integration of the CRS and CWS into the new Group structure it became evident that the business required significant modernisation and rationalisation of its businesses. The Co-operative Group followed by selling its loss-making footwear and milk processing businesses as well as some aspects of its agricultural production. The business also sold many of its larger supermarkets and hypermarkets using the funds to expand further into the convenience store sector, notably through adding 600 stores, following the acquisition of the Alldays chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/Co-op-comes-to-the-rescue-of-Alldays|title=Co-op comes to the rescue of Alldays|work=FoodAndDrinkEurope.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Alldays had previously purchased the VG chain of small supermarkets, which operated a [[Business franchise|franchise]] operation, supplying marketing and own-brand products to independently owned grocers. The Co-op invested significantly in distribution facilities, notably by opening a purpose built National Distribution Centre in [[Coventry]] during 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/category-news/supermarket/co-op-opens-new-ndc/|title=Co-op opens new NDC|work=Talking Retail|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their steady expansion after 2000 the [[The Co-operative Pharmacy|Pharmacy]] and [[The Co-operative Funeralcare|Funeralcare]] businesses were performing well, however the farming business was poorly aligned with the needs of the food stores and so was significantly reorganised in 2007 to focus the farmland on producing produce for the business' food stores. The co-op also moved into new business opportunities during this period adding a [[The Co-operative Legal Services|legal services business]] (providing [[conveyancing]], [[Will and testament|will]] writing and [[probate]] services) and an Energy Generation business, the latter included significant investment in renewable energy generation which formed another key aspect of the co-op's drive towards its ethical image. This period was successful for the co-op in increasing its profitability and in beginning to rationalise what had been a sprawling but rather unsuccessful conglomerate. Many however, believed that for the co-op to survive in the long term it would need to merge with other large co-operative societies.\n\nAt the start of 2007, the group began discussions with [[United Co-operatives]], then the UK's second-largest co-operative, about a merger of the societies.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |title=Co-op boards back merger plan |publisher=Boards of the Co-operative Group and [[United Co-operatives]] |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219093136/http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |archivedate=19 February 2007 }}</ref> Such a merger was expected to lead to significant efficiency savings owing to the large duplication of services which the two societies provided.

The basic salaries of the thirteen executives adds up to \u00a34,836,000, with their performance related bonuses adding up to \u00a3240,000.<ref>The Co-operative Group: Annual Report 2012, p. 46</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, \"private and confidential\" documents seen by ''The Observer'' newspaper detailed proposals put before The Co-operative's board to double the wage bill for senior management to \u00a312&nbsp;million a year, whereby the chief executive Euan Sutherland would earn a base salary of \u00a31.5&nbsp;million and a \"retention bonus\" of \u00a31.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|title=New Co-op storm as board awards bosses huge pay and bonus deals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/08/new-co-op-storm-pay-deals|publisher=The Observer/The Guardian|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2014|last1=Doward|first1=Jamie}}</ref>  ''The Observer'' also reported that Rebecca Skitt, the Co-op's chief human resources officer, who joined in February 2013, left 12 months later \"with a proposed pay-off totalling more than \u00a32m\".\n\n===Member Owner Governance Structure 2007 to 2015===\nBetween the creation of The Co-operative Group in 2000 and the major governance changes of 2014\u20132015, the Group had a complex governance arrangement which consisted of the business executive, the Group Board of twenty people, a series of regional boards and numerous area committees. This could be likened to English local, county and national government, where society members stood for election and if successful were expected to represent members at all levels of the society, simultaneously, with positions held in on co-op committees corresponding to departments (the businesses boards), the cabinet (the national Board), devolved nations and regions(Regional Boards), counties and parish councils (Area Committees), plus doing press events and engaging with neighbourhoods and communities such as a highly paid professional member a national government might face: Quite a task for volunteer laypeople.\n\nThe Group Board was made up of fifteen \"lay\" member directors elected from regional boards, another five which came from the \"independent societies\" and, though there was the option to appoint up to three \"independent professional non-executive directors\" (IPNEDs) to the Group Board at any one time, only one was ever appointed.\n\nAll Group Board members (excluding IPNEDs) were appointed by competitive regional election \u2013 in contrast, most building societies and [[public limited company|PLCs]] have a nominations committee consisting of members of the executive which picks potential board members and puts them up for uncontested elections.\n\nA series of regional boards, consisting of twelve to fifteen people elected from area committees, were responsible for holding the Group Board to account and for block-voting at the Annual General Meeting. There were 48 area committees which were responsible for representing member interests and promoting membership within their constituency.\n\nOut of the millions of members that the Group had, only area committee members were able to vote in the elections for the regional boards and \"lay\" director seats on the Group Board and the votes were weighted depending on the value of sales within individual areas.\n\nOne of the justifications for this complex governance arrangement was that it took a number of years to reach regional board level, which helped to minimise the influence of single-issue campaigners and [[carpet-bagger]]s. In the 1990s it was these issues, notably the failed take-over by [[Andrew Regan]] in 1997, which caused significant problems for the, then, CRS and CWS.\n\nThe Myners Review noted that \"the primary source of power within the Group [was] firmly entrenched at the level of the Regional Boards\", replicating the roles of the predecessor regional societies in voting a century before, and the review concluded that it was this 'labyrinthine' structure, where Group Board members need to remain elected to Area Committees and regional boards, which led to the governance problems at the Co-op and its financial crisis of 2013.<ref name=myners />\n\n==Dividend and membership scheme==\nThe idea of co-operative trading revolutionised food retailing with the [[dividend]], often known as \"divi\", and the \"divi number\" became a part of British life. The way in which co-operative retail societies are run for the benefit, and on behalf of their members sets them apart from their modern-day competitors. The dividend is a financial reward to members based on each member's level of trade with the society. The distribution of profits on the basis of turnover rather than capital invested is a fundamental difference between a co-operative and most private sector enterprises.\n\n===History of co-op membership===\nHistorically, members' sales would be recorded in ledgers in society's stores and at the end of the collection period a proportional payment would be made to the member. As the societies grew, and the number of members increased, the method of using ledgers became cumbersome. As a solution, some societies, including Co-operative Retail Services, issued stamps to members for qualifying transactions. Members collected stamps on a savings card and, when the card was complete, would use it as payment for goods or deposit into their share account.\n\nBy the late 20th century the group's predecessors and then the Co-operative Group no longer paid true dividend as it had become a drain on limited resources, although several independent societies (such as [[Anglia Regional]]) continued to do so. In the mid-1990s a [[Loyalty program|loyalty card scheme]], in the style of the [[Tesco Clubcard]], was introduced which used the dividend brand.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[The Grocer]] |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |title=National rollout for CWS reward card |quote=The card which has been on trial since May 1996 is unique in that it awards cash payments rather than credit points. |date=25 October 1997 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |author=Christian Cull |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720184541/http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> These loyalty cards were inspired by the co-operative dividend but were little more than marketing exercises and a way to gather useful customer information. Co-operative customers, not just members, could sign up and receive a swipe card to record purchases with vouchers sent out twice a year which could be exchanged for cash or goods.\n\nIn September 2006 the Co-operative Group relaunched \"true\" dividend whereby a proportion of the profits of the Co-operative Group is returned to members. To emphasise the change, the scheme is now called the ''Co-operative Membership'' and members earn a \"share of the profits\". New members are recruited by allowing them to deduct the refundable subscription for a \u00a31 share from their first dividend. Members can collect points to increase their share of the profits by using the services provided across the whole family of businesses. In 2008, the dividend almost doubled to \u00a338&nbsp;million, equivalent to 2.63p per point (one point being earned for each \u00a31 food purchase), reflecting an 8% increase in underlying profit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&res_dat=xri:pqil:res_ver=0.2&res_id=xri:newsuk&rft_id=xri:newsuk:newsart:1501610241|title=Bumper double dividend of pounds 38m for members of Co-operative Group\n|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|date=27 June 2008|page=21|accessdate=29 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nGroup membership increased sharply in the first year after the relaunch, to 2.5&nbsp;million with many more young people who have an affinity with the co-operative values and principles attracted to join.<ref name=\"2007prelim\">{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Merger-delivers-strong-profit-growth-for-The-Co-operative-Group/ |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2008 |publisher=The Co-operative Group |title=Press release: Merger delivers strong profit growth, preliminary results |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626103259/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Merger-delivers-strong-profit-growth-for-The-Co-operative-Group/ |archivedate=26 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"3m members\">{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Co-operative-Membership-smashes-three-million-barrier/ |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=9 August 2008 |publisher=The Co-operative Group |title=Press release: Co-operative Membership smashes three million barrier |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009132614/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/press/news/Co-operative-Membership-smashes-three-million-barrier/ |archivedate=9 October 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/news/7297/Co-operative-Group-sees-surge-.ehtml|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203172342/http://www.talkingretail.com/news/7297/Co-operative-Group-sees-surge-.ehtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 February 2013|title=Co-operative Group sees surge in younger members|work=Talking Retail|date=5 November 2007\n|accessdate=30 June 2008|publisher=Nexus Business Media}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Oxford-based [[Midcounties Co-operative]] joined the group's membership scheme allowing its members to earn dividend at Co-operative Group stores and vice versa. Since then, other independent co-operatives have joined the reciprocal membership dividend scheme, including [[Central England Co-operative]] (merged from [[Anglia Regional Co-operative Society|Anglia]] and [[Midlands Co-operative|Midlands]] who joined in 2008 and 2010 respectively), [[Southern Co-operative]] (2009) and [[Chelmsford Star Co-operative Society]] (2009). This reciprocal membership agreement means members of these societies can earn membership points at more than 90% of UK co-operative outlets.\n\n===Current membership scheme===\nThe current co-op membership scheme was launched in September 2016 and rewards members with 5% of what they spend on own brand products and services being credited back to their membership account. A further 1% is donated to a local charitable or community cause which the members helps to select. Additionally, members will still earn their share of the profits when the member dividend returns (expected 2018). Though the independent societies are not participating in the 5+1% scheme, members can earn the points (from which the profit share is derived) at five of the largest consumer's co-operatives within the UK owing to a reciprocal membership scheme (described above).\n\n==Ethical trading and campaigning==\nAs the UK's largest co-operative, the group plays a key part in the co-operative movement. In the 1840s the original co-op shops were set up to protect consumers from adulterated food and profiteering shopkeepers. Since then the co-operative movement has campaigned on a number of issues which they thought were key consumer interests. As a part of this, The Co-operative Group has long been campaigning for consumer rights legislation, researching into new food labelling initiatives, a major sponsor of new co-operative ventures, a notable donor to community initiatives, directly involved in the development of animal welfare standards and in championing [[Fairtrade]] in the UK.\n\nThe Co-op has traded on its 'ethical' credentials for many years and in 2014 a survey suggested that 70% of the British public believed that it was a business that 'tried to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haveyoursay.coop|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The co-op is particularly known for its work in championing the introduction of Fairtrade in the UK, investing in renewable energy and in reducing its carbon emissions, in maintaining high standards of animal welfare, in being a leading retailer of responsible fish, for reinvesting its profits in local communities and for campaigning on a range of social issues.\n\nThe Co-operative is widely recognised for its commitment to responsible and ethical trading, particularly for championing [[fairtrade]] in the UK.<ref name=\"fairtrade.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/buying-fairtrade/tea/cooperative|title=The Co-operative|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> These commitments and its mutual structure led to The Co-operative Food being awarded ''[[Ethical Consumer]]'' magazine's 'Best Buy' status in 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/food/supermarkets.aspx|title=The most ethical supermarkets.

The Co-op implemented this labelling system on own-brand products the same year. Further research in 1993 suggested that many consumers were confused by the nutritional labelling schemes used at the time. Both of these findings were supported by evidence gathered by the [[Food Standards Agency]] in 2002 and the Institute for Grocery Distribution proposed a new labelling system based upon the [[guideline daily amount]] principle.\n\nAs a consequence of this research, the Co-op trialled a new greatly extended labelling format which went above the legal requirement for what should be included at the time (energy, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, fat, of which saturates, [[fibre]] and sodium) by including reference values for \"guideline daily amounts\", displaying whether each item constitutes \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\", providing information regarding recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables, using the word \"calories\" rather than \"energy\" and for displaying \"[[salt]]\" rather than \"[[sodium]]\". Overall this new design was endorsed by 89% of those customers asked. As a part of this change, the Co-op was also the first to introduce a graphic on the front of all own-brand products which highlighted the key nutritional information. The choice of the word \"salt\" over \"sodium\" was made because their research suggested that most consumers did not understand the difference between the two words and hence significantly underestimated the salt content of processed foods. Because of this, the Co-op also called for the government to legislate so that salt rather than sodium should be displayed on the packing of products.<ref name=Corporate>{{cite report |url=https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |title=Lie of the Label II |accessdate=2015-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103411/https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all |publisher=The Co-op}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 The Co-operative Group published further research which they had conducted into front-of-pack labelling schemes and have modified their own front-of-pack labelling scheme to combine both the traffic light and guideline daily amount schemes into one simple system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retailtimes.co.uk/co-operative-food-research-champions-traffic-lights-and-new-front-of-pack-labelling/|title=Co-operative Food research champions traffic lights and front-of-pack labelling|work=Retail Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> In 2009 the Co-op also introduced a 'green dot' scheme where additional specifically defined nutritional benefits in products (e.g. over 6&nbsp;g of fibre per 100 g) were included on the front of the pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/magazine/foodanddrink/healthy-eating/green-dots-explained/|title=green dots explained \u2013 traffic light labelling for a healthier diet|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Since 2003, the Co-op has been using a similar system to highlight products which count towards one's '5 a day' fruit and veg \u2013 also listing the quantity of the product which required to reach the required serving size.\n\nSince 1997 the group has not used \"per-cent fat free\" health claims. The Co-op introduced calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks in 2002 and they also list the caffeine content of products which contain more than 1.6&nbsp;mg in a single serving.\n\nStarting in 1995 the Co-op conducted a survey of the views of over 31,000 customers which suggested that customers wanted to make more informed buying decisions. Consequently, in 1997 the Co-operative Wholesale Society, forerunner to The Co-operative Group, published a report titled \"The Lie of the Label\" which presented a number of techniques which the Co-op accused the food industry of using to mislead the consumer. These included:\n# hiding key information from consumers about a product (e.g. \"products called 'mince' and 'onion', where the main ingredient was mechanically recovered chicken\");\n# using meaningless terms like 'wholesome' or 'natural' to make the product seem better;\n# using unrealistic photographs to make the product seem better on the label than what is achievable with what is actually sold;\n# using claims which make something normal seem special (e.g. dried pasta which is free from preservatives, a legal requirement);\n# framing claims to make a products characteristics seem better (e.g. 80% fat free crisps, when they would have been only 20% fat anyway); and\n# using very small fonts or text colours to make the label difficult to read.

The Group's roots are traced back to the [[Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers]], established in 1844.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our History |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/| publisher=The Co-operative Group}}</ref> The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was based on the [[Rochdale Principles]] \u2013 which notably introduced the idea of distributing a share of profits according to purchases through a scheme which became to be known as \"the divi\".\n\n[[File:Co-op poster, Town, Beamish Museum, 26 November 2006 (1).jpg|thumb|An advert for CWS candles]]\nAlthough the Co-operative Group incorporates the original Rochdale Society, the business' core for much of its history were its wholesale operations. This began in 1863 when the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited was launched in [[Manchester]] by 300 individual co-operatives in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. By 1872, it was known as the 'Co-operative Wholesale Society' (CWS) and it was wholly owned by the co-operatives which traded with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|title=1862|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205339/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/1862/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\">Wilson, J.

It was this continued and fierce competition with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in [[Leeds]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bristol]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Huddersfield]] alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits ([[Manchester]]), boots ([[Leicester]]), soap ([[Durham, England|Durham]]) and textiles ([[Batley]]). In an attempt to drive down the significant cost of transportation for produce the CWS even began its own shipping line which initially sailed from [[Goole]] docks to parts of continental [[Europe]]. One of the CWS' steamships, the ''Pioneer'', was the first commercial vessel to use the [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of [[World War I]] the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a [[tea]] plantation in India.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n[[File:Co-op land, Manchester 1995.jpg|thumb|The head offices for the Co-operative Bank and the CIS in [[Manchester]]'s 'co-op quarter']]\nThere was a great deal of consideration on the role of the CWS in the British co-operative movement around the turn of the twentieth century. Many, fiercely local, societies saw the CWS as a valuable supplier but did not want to exclusively purchase produce from them owing to perceptions of high cost (mostly transport costs) and unreliable quality \u2013 some things the CWS were at pains to resolve. In contrast to this, the CWS had its aim to be the centrepoint for the whole co-operative movement in the UK and lobbied hard for loyalty from co-ops. To this end, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to [[The Co-operative Bank]], financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the [[Co-operative Insurance|Co-operative Insurance Society]] in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing [[Co-operative Legal Services|legal services]] \u2013 all businesses which form parts of the Co-operative Group today. It was hoped that these financial ties, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===WWII and post-war decline (1939\u20131989)===\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[rationing]] led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods.\n\nDuring this time, the CWS began planning for the future, as even then they could see the potential disruption to the retail market that the new multiple grocers could have. What was less obvious at the time would be the impact of [[National Savings]] and national taxation on the movement, as Britain shifted from a country of friendly, building and co-operative societies, to one with a National Health Service, National House building programs and National Post Office Bank [[NS&I]][[General Post Office|GPO]]. In 1944, the CWS published a report entitled ''Policy and Programme for Post War Development'' which focused on methods for revitalising the co-op movement after the war had ended. The report suggested merging the CWS with the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society (SCWS); reducing the number of co-operative societies through merger; moving into the manufacturing and production of [[white goods]] and the expansion of [[the Co-operative Bank]].\n\nThis report received much criticism from the fiercely local co-operative societies and the proposals of the report were only partly and slowly implemented. The end of war allowed some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores around this time, while the slow demobilisation of the wartime boost of full employment and high wages partly waned consumer spending power. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first self-service shop in 1942, the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|title=1901\u20131950|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104185939/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/19011950/|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Despite this the subscribed share capital (risk capital) available to societies to innovate and take risks dwindled causing market share and relative quality of the service societies could offer their members to dwindle. Consequently, this impacted the movement by reducing the number of society members willing to enter membership and then actively trade with their co-operatives, leading to further real terms falls in withdraw-able member share capital levels, and in the level or return generated co-operative investment in the form of lower interest and dividends. A corollary of falling market share was continued ownership of freehold land, property and infrastructure, such as warehouses, dairies and farmland (the [[Co-operative Farms]]) built up by societies with accumulated surpluses from the 50 years of growth before the war.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nThe Co-operative Independent Commission (1958) was tasked with investigating the decline in the co-op movement and for making recommendations for revitalising the movement in the future. Its recommendations had two main thrusts: that a strong response to the emerging multiple-store supermarket chains (including the appointment of professional managers)<ref name=myners /> was needed and that the Co-op needed to come to terms with the rise in consumerism and to move away from its association with the \"working poor\" rather than a more prosperous working class.\n\nThis was not to say that the Co-op had not been modernising, notably through opening self-service stores and supermarkets. However, the report suggested that the Co-op needed to become more responsive to the grocery market by being more competitive on price, by rationalising on unprofitable stores and by recruiting professional managers. The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the [[The Co-operative brand|first national co-operative branding]], the 'Co-op' cloverleaf.\n\nThough Operation Facelift led to some improvements, the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing a downward trend.<ref name=myners /> Again, it was suggested that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through enhanced economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or were absorbed into either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable, and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.\n\nThe merger did highlight the potential of The Co-operative Bank as it was building a sizeable base of customers (notably local authorities, mutuals and local groups alongside co-operative societies) and this became an increasingly significant proportion of the CWS's annual profits. The growth in the bank largely related to its aggressive expansion into the [[personal banking]] market and with the pioneering of free banking (1972) in the UK, nine years before any of its larger rivals.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n[[File:1996 - Co-op Lisburn Road store, Belfast (12541793775).jpg|thumb|The Co-op superstore Lisburn Road, [[Belfast]], shown here in 1996.]]\n\nThe co-operative movement's marketshare and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 1980s, in part, due to a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the process of [[de-industrialisation]], that had characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands (notably the northern industrial towns), which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in overall consumer disposable income. This was largely due to the strong increase in wealth and social inequality in the UK at this time. The co-operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and The Co-op's historic association as the shop for the \"working poor\".\n\nSecondly, redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing (which featured co-op stores dotted throughout) to newer purpose-built estates, with around 18,000 co-op stores closing as they had become redundant.\n\nThirdly, the time was a period of notable [[inflation]] and a strong pound, which had led to a wave of cheap imported goods \u2013 this devastated much of the UK's manufacturing industries (including the CWS). By the 1980s, it became clear that the trend in the retail sector was towards large (often out of town) supermarkets and [[hypermarkets]] with hundreds of them appearing across the UK.\n\nThe co-operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness. In an attempt to improve the collective buying power of the movement the CWS acted to reposition itself from a wholesaler (from which societies can choose to buy) to a 'buying group' (where the CWS buys on behalf of), in order that CWS could increase the proportion of produce sold through co-operative stores that was sourced by itself. Though this did work to increase loyalty, it was not until the 2000s with the development of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group]] that the CWS became the ''[[de facto]]'' wholesaler for co-operative stores.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nDuring the 1980s, the CWS began to merge with a number of failing co-operative societies, having returned to direct retailing after its merger with the SCWS the decade before. These mergers with consumers' co-operatives led to the co-op having both corporate (co-op societies) and individual members, hence making it both a primary and [[secondary co-operative]].<ref name=\"myners\"/> The CWS's expansion into direct retailing (especially after the mergers of the 2000s) led to the CWS becoming a highly visible business in the UK. The legacy of this was that many people perceive the British co-operative movement to be one business, The Co-operative Group, or co-op for short.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\n===Modernisation and takeover attempts (1990\u20131999)===\nBy the start of the 1990s, the co-operative movement's share of the UK grocery market had declined to the point where the entire business model was in question. This was at a time when many [[building society|building societies]] were demutualising as many of the public preferred the short-term financial gain of the windfall payment over the perceived lack of benefits from the mutual model. For a time it seemed as though the mutual or co-op model was almost dead.\n\nThe Co-op's reputation was not helped in this respect by the factions within the movement, notably the strong rivalry between the [[Co-operative Retail Services|CRS]] and the CWS, acting in a manner which exacerbated the belief held by many members of the public that, rather than working for the interests of all members, co-ops were largely acting in the self-interests of a dominant 'clique' of members within each society.\n\nTogether these crises meant that the 1990s would become a crucial decade if the Co-op was to survive. In order to raise capital to invest in its food stores (and also the increasingly successful Co-operative Bank), the CWS sold many of its factories to [[Andrew Regan]] in 1994 for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]111 million in what initially appeared to be a highly beneficial arrangement for the CWS.\n\nHowever, later it appeared that those involved in this deal did so without the CWS Board's permission and had been also handing confidential CWS files to Regan. Notably, one Sunday newspaper printed the CWS' annual report before it had been officially released. This would later pose a huge threat to the CWS when in 1997 Regan posed a highly ambitious \u00a31.2bn hostile takeover attempt of the CWS.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/coop-rejects-regans-advance-1271324.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Co-op rejects Regan's advance | author=Nigel Cope\n|date=6 March 1997 }}</ref> This shocked many in the movement and consolidated support for the CWS as the 'linchpin' of the movement in a way that many had previous opposed.\n\nThe CWS, under the leadership of Graham Melmoth, was able to defend itself from this takeover bid, largely by informing Regan's creditors that his hostile takeover was based upon dubiously sourced data and bad business practices. The deal also failed because Regan had greatly misunderstood the CWS' complicated ownership structure, assuming that by paying off the 500,000 'active members' he could gain control of the CWS.\n\nThough this strategy worked for the [[carpetbagger#United Kingdom|carpetbaggers]] working to demutualise UK building societies at the time, it failed to recognise that the ownership actually lay with millions of ordinary members and that many of these 'active members' were staunch co-operators and who would be unlikely to back the bid.\n\nAfter investigations by a private detective and a subsequent criminal court case, Regan's bid was rejected and two senior CWS executives were dismissed and imprisoned for fraud. An arrest warrant was issued for Andrew Regan in 1999 however he had already emigrated to [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/34792/news/consumer/regan039s-out-court-settlement-co-op-group/|title=Regan's out-of-court settlement with Co-op Group|author=Co-operative News|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=18 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe shock that Regan's bid sent through the co-operative movement has been attributed with sowing the seeds for the reduced hostilities between the CWS and CRS factions which eventually ended with the CRS becoming a member of the [[Co-operative Retail Trading Group|CRTG]] before fully merging with the CWS in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/670302.stm |title=Co-op merger approved |publisher=BBC |date=8 March 2000 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> The merger took two years to complete and the launch of the newly combined business, named The Co-operative Group, was timed with the release of the 2001 [[Co-operative Commission]] report, chaired by [[John Monks]], which proposed a strategy of modernisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.coop/newsroom/ten-years-co-operative-commission|title=Blog: Ten Years from the Co-operative Commission \u2013 Co-operatives UK Newsroom|work=uk.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe report focused on improving store design and building a consistent [[The Co-operative brand|branding]] whilst also driving for efficiency savings to make the food business more competitive \u2013 the similarity in conclusions between the 1919, 1958 and 2001 reports highlights the distinct lack of progress within the movement during this time. The 2001 report also highlighted the need to market what it called 'The Co-operative Advantage'; a favourite idea of Graham Melmoth, which suggested that commercial success would provide the funding for the social goals of the movement which (when the public saw a tangible benefit to their own lives) would provide a competitive advantage to the Co-op which would further its commercial success \u2013 a virtuous cycle. Unlike Gaitskell Commission's 1958 report the recommendations of the report, notably the major update to \"The Co-operative brand\" and the re-launch of the membership dividend scheme, were largely adopted by the co-operative movement including The Co-operative Group. These changes to the business are largely credited with the successes in profitability and the achievement in social goals which improved in the years after the Co-operative Commission report.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031044419/http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/News/newsArchive/2005/commissionSuccess|archive-date=31 October 2007|website=Co-operatives UK|date=13 June 2005|title=Commission Paves the Way for Co-operative Success}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of the CWS-CRS merger, new governance arrangements were designed with the 'independent societies' becoming part owners of the new Group and their representatives were elected to the group's national board. The largest change, however, was the much stronger representation for the individual members of the retailing operation with a string of regional boards and area committees designed to facilitate a clear democracy and representation on a local and national level. The composite nature of the Co-op as both a primary and a [[secondary co-operative]] led to the business having both individual members and corporate members (independent co-operative societies) which had to be included in any democratic structure. This led to a governance arrangement which was complicated and not understood by many individual members and which led to relatively few members becoming democratically engaged with the business. During 2007 the then chief executive Martin Beaumont was critical of the lack of commercial expertise on the board, foreshadowing the conclusions drawn from later Myners review into the near failure of the business during 2013 which was (in part) due to an unfit governance arrangement.<ref name=myners /> In 2014 the governance arrangements were completely redesigned to reflect the recommendations of the Myners review \u2013 for more information see the [[The Co-operative Group#Governance|governance section]].\n\n====Establishing the \"Co-operative difference\"====\nThough the modernisation of the business was most noticeable after the 1997 takeover attempt, this is not to say that modernisation of the CWS had not been under way for some time. Since 1993 the CRTG had been working to switch the role of the CWS from \"selling to\" to \"buying for\" co-operative societies as a way of maximising the economies of scale to become more competitive to the major supermarkets. Since the 1960s the Co-op had been following retail trends after they had occurred, always having to catch up, in a way that it led the changes before the Second World War. Many leaders within the movement began to appreciate that this 'me too' approach to retailing was not working, for example, expanding into [[hypermarkets]] after [[Tesco]] and [[Sainsbury's]] had already developed a dominant position, but without the resources to compete on price. After the 1997 strategic review the business suggested that it close the majority of its [[hypermarkets]] and [[department stores]] and instead focus on its core chain of [[convenience store]]s.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nAs a further attempt to differentiate itself from its larger competitors The Co-operative Bank had introduced an ethical policy in 1992 and this, along with its technical innovation, was well received with customers. The CWS decided that, though it had always aimed to trade responsibly (for example though the working conditions in its factories and plantations as well as its boycott of South African produce during the years of [[Apartheid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/40332/news/social-enterprise/my-story-how-co-operators-led-south-african-boycott-support-mandela/|title=My story: How co-operators led a South African boycott in support of Mandela|author=Elaine Dean|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=12 December 2013}}</ref>), by cementing its \"ethical\" credentials in a series of strong and clear policy commitments it could work to convince the public of the \"co-operative difference\".\n\nThis move posed a bold step for the CWS leadership as this was a wholly new approach for such a large business. As a part of this, the Co-op worked with [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] to help introduce the [[Fairtrade Mark]] in the UK. It was an early adopter of the [[RSPCA]]'s 'Freedom Foods' animal welfare certification. It introduced the first supermarket range of 'environmentally friendly' household products and the first range of toiletries certified by [[Cruelty Free International]] as \"not tested on animals\".\n\nThis new adoption of an ethical strategy was only part of the CWS' changes. The Co-op had been pioneering on notable changes to its packaging with nutritional labelling on food (1985) and later introduced [[Braille]] on its packaging. Many [[own brand]] products were also reformulated to reduce the amount of salt, sugar and fat in order to make the product range more healthy. So successful was this initiative that competitors such as Sainsbury's and [[Marks and Spencer]] began to follow aggressively on these initiatives.\n[[File:Co-op shop - geograph.org.uk - 593466.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Co-Op Welcome' branding from [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]]]\n\n[[File:Co-op Store at Warwickgates - geograph.org.uk - 1098934.jpg|thumb|Example of the 'Late Shop' branding on the co-op store in [[Whitnash]]]]\nIn an attempt to build upon the success which was being felt around the increasing public perception of the co-op as an ethical retailer and to implement what was a core recommendation of the 2001 Co-operatives Commission, The Co-operative Group launched a brand panel which was tasked with developing a single consistent national branding standard for the movement. For decades, marketing by co-operatives was confusing for many customers with different societies adopting different store names (notably \"Co-op Welcome\" and \"Co-op Late Shop\"), various shop fascia designs and inconsistent marketing. Also, the cloverleaf design of the Co-op logo was seen by many as too associated with the years of neglect and decline within the movement and hence The Co-operative Group aimed to launch a totally new brand.\n\nThe new \"[[The Co-operative brand|The Co-operative]]\" branding was first displayed at the 2005 co-operative congress and became the first brand which could bring together all of the co-operative businesses (both those of The Group and the independent societies) under a single consistent brand. With the brand came a set of standards which any outlet using the brand must adhere to \u2013 to maintain a high standard of impression with customers. A twelve-month pilot of the new branding followed and these suggested that a significant growth in sales followed the re-branding of stores, largely understood to result from a major impact on public perceptions. Not all of the independent societies joined this new branding however, with [[United Co-operatives]] (prior to its merger with the Co-operative Group), the [[Scottish Midland Co-operative Society]] and the [[Lincolnshire Co-operative Society]] not adopting the new brand design. In combination with the new \"The Co-operative\" redesign, the Co-op sought to relaunch the co-operative membership scheme using a single consistent national standard and featuring the re-introduction of the member dividend.<ref name=\"Building Co-operation 2013\" />\n\nTogether, this renewed focus on responsible trading, the redesign of \"The Co-operative\" brand and the reintroduction of the member dividend helped to build the start of a renewed relationship with the British public. In 2006 a survey found the Co-op to be the most trusted major retailer in the UK and almost six million people joined the membership scheme over the following five years. Even after The Co-operative Group's financial crisis of 2013 the 'Have Your Say' survey found that more than 70% of the public agreed that the Co-op 'tries to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion (2000\u20132012)===\n[[File:VG Grocers Logo FAIR USE ONLY.jpg|thumb|180px|The VG logo and shop livery, c. 1990]]\nFollowing the integration of the CRS and CWS into the new Group structure it became evident that the business required significant modernisation and rationalisation of its businesses. The Co-operative Group followed by selling its loss-making footwear and milk processing businesses as well as some aspects of its agricultural production. The business also sold many of its larger supermarkets and hypermarkets using the funds to expand further into the convenience store sector, notably through adding 600 stores, following the acquisition of the Alldays chain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Retail/Co-op-comes-to-the-rescue-of-Alldays|title=Co-op comes to the rescue of Alldays|work=FoodAndDrinkEurope.com|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Alldays had previously purchased the VG chain of small supermarkets, which operated a [[Business franchise|franchise]] operation, supplying marketing and own-brand products to independently owned grocers. The Co-op invested significantly in distribution facilities, notably by opening a purpose built National Distribution Centre in [[Coventry]] during 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/category-news/supermarket/co-op-opens-new-ndc/|title=Co-op opens new NDC|work=Talking Retail|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of their steady expansion after 2000 the [[The Co-operative Pharmacy|Pharmacy]] and [[The Co-operative Funeralcare|Funeralcare]] businesses were performing well, however the farming business was poorly aligned with the needs of the food stores and so was significantly reorganised in 2007 to focus the farmland on producing produce for the business' food stores. The co-op also moved into new business opportunities during this period adding a [[The Co-operative Legal Services|legal services business]] (providing [[conveyancing]], [[Will and testament|will]] writing and [[probate]] services) and an Energy Generation business, the latter included significant investment in renewable energy generation which formed another key aspect of the co-op's drive towards its ethical image. This period was successful for the co-op in increasing its profitability and in beginning to rationalise what had been a sprawling but rather unsuccessful conglomerate. Many however, believed that for the co-op to survive in the long term it would need to merge with other large co-operative societies.\n\nAt the start of 2007, the group began discussions with [[United Co-operatives]], then the UK's second-largest co-operative, about a merger of the societies.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |title=Co-op boards back merger plan |publisher=Boards of the Co-operative Group and [[United Co-operatives]] |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=17 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219093136/http://www.co-op.co.uk/corporate/news_article.php?news_ID=378 |archivedate=19 February 2007 }}</ref> Such a merger was expected to lead to significant efficiency savings owing to the large duplication of services which the two societies provided.

This could be likened to English local, county and national government, where society members stood for election and if successful were expected to represent members at all levels of the society, simultaneously, with positions held in on co-op committees corresponding to departments (the businesses boards), the cabinet (the national Board), devolved nations and regions(Regional Boards), counties and parish councils (Area Committees), plus doing press events and engaging with neighbourhoods and communities such as a highly paid professional member a national government might face: Quite a task for volunteer laypeople.\n\nThe Group Board was made up of fifteen \"lay\" member directors elected from regional boards, another five which came from the \"independent societies\" and, though there was the option to appoint up to three \"independent professional non-executive directors\" (IPNEDs) to the Group Board at any one time, only one was ever appointed.\n\nAll Group Board members (excluding IPNEDs) were appointed by competitive regional election \u2013 in contrast, most building societies and [[public limited company|PLCs]] have a nominations committee consisting of members of the executive which picks potential board members and puts them up for uncontested elections.\n\nA series of regional boards, consisting of twelve to fifteen people elected from area committees, were responsible for holding the Group Board to account and for block-voting at the Annual General Meeting. There were 48 area committees which were responsible for representing member interests and promoting membership within their constituency.\n\nOut of the millions of members that the Group had, only area committee members were able to vote in the elections for the regional boards and \"lay\" director seats on the Group Board and the votes were weighted depending on the value of sales within individual areas.\n\nOne of the justifications for this complex governance arrangement was that it took a number of years to reach regional board level, which helped to minimise the influence of single-issue campaigners and [[carpet-bagger]]s. In the 1990s it was these issues, notably the failed take-over by [[Andrew Regan]] in 1997, which caused significant problems for the, then, CRS and CWS.\n\nThe Myners Review noted that \"the primary source of power within the Group [was] firmly entrenched at the level of the Regional Boards\", replicating the roles of the predecessor regional societies in voting a century before, and the review concluded that it was this 'labyrinthine' structure, where Group Board members need to remain elected to Area Committees and regional boards, which led to the governance problems at the Co-op and its financial crisis of 2013.<ref name=myners />\n\n==Dividend and membership scheme==\nThe idea of co-operative trading revolutionised food retailing with the [[dividend]], often known as \"divi\", and the \"divi number\" became a part of British life. The way in which co-operative retail societies are run for the benefit, and on behalf of their members sets them apart from their modern-day competitors. The dividend is a financial reward to members based on each member's level of trade with the society. The distribution of profits on the basis of turnover rather than capital invested is a fundamental difference between a co-operative and most private sector enterprises.\n\n===History of co-op membership===\nHistorically, members' sales would be recorded in ledgers in society's stores and at the end of the collection period a proportional payment would be made to the member. As the societies grew, and the number of members increased, the method of using ledgers became cumbersome. As a solution, some societies, including Co-operative Retail Services, issued stamps to members for qualifying transactions. Members collected stamps on a savings card and, when the card was complete, would use it as payment for goods or deposit into their share account.\n\nBy the late 20th century the group's predecessors and then the Co-operative Group no longer paid true dividend as it had become a drain on limited resources, although several independent societies (such as [[Anglia Regional]]) continued to do so. In the mid-1990s a [[Loyalty program|loyalty card scheme]], in the style of the [[Tesco Clubcard]], was introduced which used the dividend brand.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[The Grocer]] |url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |title=National rollout for CWS reward card |quote=The card which has been on trial since May 1996 is unique in that it awards cash payments rather than credit points. |date=25 October 1997 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |author=Christian Cull |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720184541/http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/articles.aspx?page=articles&ID=36422 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> These loyalty cards were inspired by the co-operative dividend but were little more than marketing exercises and a way to gather useful customer information. Co-operative customers, not just members, could sign up and receive a swipe card to record purchases with vouchers sent out twice a year which could be exchanged for cash or goods.\n\nIn September 2006 the Co-operative Group relaunched \"true\" dividend whereby a proportion of the profits of the Co-operative Group is returned to members. To emphasise the change, the scheme is now called the ''Co-operative Membership'' and members earn a \"share of the profits\".

Since then, other independent co-operatives have joined the reciprocal membership dividend scheme, including [[Central England Co-operative]] (merged from [[Anglia Regional Co-operative Society|Anglia]] and [[Midlands Co-operative|Midlands]] who joined in 2008 and 2010 respectively), [[Southern Co-operative]] (2009) and [[Chelmsford Star Co-operative Society]] (2009). This reciprocal membership agreement means members of these societies can earn membership points at more than 90% of UK co-operative outlets.\n\n===Current membership scheme===\nThe current co-op membership scheme was launched in September 2016 and rewards members with 5% of what they spend on own brand products and services being credited back to their membership account. A further 1% is donated to a local charitable or community cause which the members helps to select. Additionally, members will still earn their share of the profits when the member dividend returns (expected 2018). Though the independent societies are not participating in the 5+1% scheme, members can earn the points (from which the profit share is derived) at five of the largest consumer's co-operatives within the UK owing to a reciprocal membership scheme (described above).\n\n==Ethical trading and campaigning==\nAs the UK's largest co-operative, the group plays a key part in the co-operative movement. In the 1840s the original co-op shops were set up to protect consumers from adulterated food and profiteering shopkeepers. Since then the co-operative movement has campaigned on a number of issues which they thought were key consumer interests. As a part of this, The Co-operative Group has long been campaigning for consumer rights legislation, researching into new food labelling initiatives, a major sponsor of new co-operative ventures, a notable donor to community initiatives, directly involved in the development of animal welfare standards and in championing [[Fairtrade]] in the UK.\n\nThe Co-op has traded on its 'ethical' credentials for many years and in 2014 a survey suggested that 70% of the British public believed that it was a business that 'tried to do the right thing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haveyoursay.coop|title=The Co-operative \u2013 Have Your Say|work=haveyoursay.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813014618/http://www.haveyoursay.coop/|archivedate=13 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The co-op is particularly known for its work in championing the introduction of Fairtrade in the UK, investing in renewable energy and in reducing its carbon emissions, in maintaining high standards of animal welfare, in being a leading retailer of responsible fish, for reinvesting its profits in local communities and for campaigning on a range of social issues.\n\nThe Co-operative is widely recognised for its commitment to responsible and ethical trading, particularly for championing [[fairtrade]] in the UK.<ref name=\"fairtrade.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/buying-fairtrade/tea/cooperative|title=The Co-operative|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> These commitments and its mutual structure led to The Co-operative Food being awarded ''[[Ethical Consumer]]'' magazine's 'Best Buy' status in 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/food/supermarkets.aspx|title=The most ethical supermarkets.

The business has also constructed its own renewable energy generation facilities, operating three [[wind farms]] with a fourth given [[planning permission]] in 2014.

The Co-op implemented this labelling system on own-brand products the same year. Further research in 1993 suggested that many consumers were confused by the nutritional labelling schemes used at the time. Both of these findings were supported by evidence gathered by the [[Food Standards Agency]] in 2002 and the Institute for Grocery Distribution proposed a new labelling system based upon the [[guideline daily amount]] principle.\n\nAs a consequence of this research, the Co-op trialled a new greatly extended labelling format which went above the legal requirement for what should be included at the time (energy, protein, carbohydrate, of which sugars, fat, of which saturates, [[fibre]] and sodium) by including reference values for \"guideline daily amounts\", displaying whether each item constitutes \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\", providing information regarding recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables, using the word \"calories\" rather than \"energy\" and for displaying \"[[salt]]\" rather than \"[[sodium]]\". Overall this new design was endorsed by 89% of those customers asked. As a part of this change, the Co-op was also the first to introduce a graphic on the front of all own-brand products which highlighted the key nutritional information. The choice of the word \"salt\" over \"sodium\" was made because their research suggested that most consumers did not understand the difference between the two words and hence significantly underestimated the salt content of processed foods. Because of this, the Co-op also called for the government to legislate so that salt rather than sodium should be displayed on the packing of products.<ref name=Corporate>{{cite report |url=https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |title=Lie of the Label II |accessdate=2015-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103411/https://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Lie%20of%20the%20Label%20II%20Report.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all |publisher=The Co-op}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 The Co-operative Group published further research which they had conducted into front-of-pack labelling schemes and have modified their own front-of-pack labelling scheme to combine both the traffic light and guideline daily amount schemes into one simple system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retailtimes.co.uk/co-operative-food-research-champions-traffic-lights-and-new-front-of-pack-labelling/|title=Co-operative Food research champions traffic lights and front-of-pack labelling|work=Retail Times|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> In 2009 the Co-op also introduced a 'green dot' scheme where additional specifically defined nutritional benefits in products (e.g. over 6&nbsp;g of fibre per 100 g) were included on the front of the pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/magazine/foodanddrink/healthy-eating/green-dots-explained/|title=green dots explained \u2013 traffic light labelling for a healthier diet|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref> Since 2003, the Co-op has been using a similar system to highlight products which count towards one's '5 a day' fruit and veg \u2013 also listing the quantity of the product which required to reach the required serving size.\n\nSince 1997 the group has not used \"per-cent fat free\" health claims. The Co-op introduced calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks in 2002 and they also list the caffeine content of products which contain more than 1.6&nbsp;mg in a single serving.\n\nStarting in 1995 the Co-op conducted a survey of the views of over 31,000 customers which suggested that customers wanted to make more informed buying decisions. Consequently, in 1997 the Co-operative Wholesale Society, forerunner to The Co-operative Group, published a report titled \"The Lie of the Label\" which presented a number of techniques which the Co-op accused the food industry of using to mislead the consumer. These included:\n# hiding key information from consumers about a product (e.g. \"products called 'mince' and 'onion', where the main ingredient was mechanically recovered chicken\");\n# using meaningless terms like 'wholesome' or 'natural' to make the product seem better;\n# using unrealistic photographs to make the product seem better on the label than what is achievable with what is actually sold;\n# using claims which make something normal seem special (e.g. dried pasta which is free from preservatives, a legal requirement);\n# framing claims to make a products characteristics seem better (e.g. 80% fat free crisps, when they would have been only 20% fat anyway); and\n# using very small fonts or text colours to make the label difficult to read. Since 1995, the Co-op has clearly labelled the country of origin and percentage content of key ingredients, even when not required to by law.<ref name=Responsible>{{cite report |url=http://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Responsible%20Business%20Report.pdf |title=Values in Action |accessdate=2015-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205243/http://www.co-operative.coop/Corporate/PDFs/Responsible%20Business%20Report.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |publisher=The Co-operative Group |date=May 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe follow-up report, \"The Lie of the Label II\" (2002), specifically urged legislative improvements to provide consumers with better nutritional information on all foods (especially those foods which disproportionately contribute to consumers' fat, salt and sugar intake) and a new, clearer, more intuitive format for presenting this information to consumers. The report also warned about the prevalence of advertising for sugary, fatty and/or salty foods which are aimed at children and how this will likely impact on the overall public health of young people the UK.<ref name=Corporate/>\n\nThe group has campaigned against many misleading nutritional and 'health' claims which have appeared on food packaging over the years. Those cited included a chocolate spread which is high in both fat and sugar, but which was marketed as \"rich in calcium, magnesium and vitamins\". Other such claims have included products which are advertised as \"low [[cholesterol]]\" when [[saturated fat]] is thought to be a larger control on blood cholesterol than direct cholesterol consumption.<ref name=\"Corporate\"/> The group operates a self-imposed ban on such health claims. In 2003 the European Commission introduced legislation which defined many health claims such as \"fat free\" and \"high fibre\" to reduce the prevalence of meaningless claims on food packaging, a move welcomed by the co-op movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.coop/34328/news/business/co-ops-back-labelling-crackdown/|title=Co-ops back labelling crackdown|author=Co-operative News|work=Co-operative News|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=18 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 the group became the first retailer to include Braille writing on its range of medicines and alcoholic drinks, a move which received three industry awards.<ref name=Responsible/> In 2015 Braille can also be found on many products, including breakfast cereals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/2001present/|title=2001 \u2013 present day|work=co-operative.coop|accessdate=29 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128043902/http://www.co-operative.coop/corporate/aboutus/ourhistory/2001present/|archivedate=28 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/216426/co-op-extend-braille-labelling-food-range|title=Co-op to extend braille labelling to food range|work=marketingmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Co-operative Group became the first retailer to list the ingredients in its own-brand wines on the label in 1999 in a move that was illegal at the time.

increase from 4,211 in 2000.\n\n==History==\n\nPittsfield was initially settled by settlers from [[New England]].  These settlers were of old [[Yankee]] stock, descended from the English Puritans who had founded and settled [[New England]] in the 1600s.  A group of settlers from [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] headed west and settled this region of [[Illinois]] in 1820.  When they arrived the area was a virgin wilderness, they constructed farms, roads and government buildings.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=lhwVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+pike+county#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20pike%20county&f=false |title = History of Pike County, Illinois: Together with Sketches of Its Cities, Villages and Townships, Educational, Religious, Civil, Military, and Political History; Portraits of Prominent Persons and Biographies of Representative Citizens.

As county seat, the town was one of the various places in central Illinois where Abraham Lincoln practiced law as part of the circuit court, working on 34 cases between 1839 and 1852. One local newspaper, now known as the ''Pike Press'', was then owned by another of Lincoln's future secretaries, [[John Nicolay]], and featured an editorial containing one of the first known suggestions of Lincoln as the Republican nominee for the presidency.\n\nPittsfield is the self-proclaimed \"Pork Capital\" of the Midwest, owing to the long history of pork production in the region, which fed into the large meat-packing industry of Chicago. Though agriculture in the region is no longer so dependent on pork, the town still hosts a yearly \"Pig Days\" festival.\n\nThe local high school football team, the Saukees, still holds the record for longest winning streak in the state, and the 21st longest in the country.  Starting with their season opening 6\u20130 win over North Greene in 1966, the Pittsfield Saukees reeled off 64 consecutive wins, which included 15 straight shutouts between 1969 and 1971. In 1970, the team outscored their opponents 341-0 and allowed negative rushing yards for the season. The streak extended all the way through to the second game of the 1973 season, when Pittsfield dropped a 12-0 decision to Winchester, Illinois.<ref>http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-17/sports/9710170087_1_pittsfield-high-school-illinois-big-deal</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maxpreps.com/list/all_time_streaks.aspx?gendersport=boys,football|title=Longest High School Football Winning Streaks - MaxPreps|website=www.maxpreps.com|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/high-school/ct-greatest-illinois-high-school-football-teams-spt-1119-20171118-story.html|title=The 32 greatest Illinois high school football teams of all time|last=Bannon|first=Will Larkin, Tim|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nPittsfield is the setting for [[Jamie Gilson]]'s book ''Hello, My Name is Scrambled Eggs''.

The cornerstone was laid on July 12, 1894 and the dedication of the new courthouse was on November 16, 1895. Robert Franklin, a master mason from Nebo, Illinois designed and supervised the keystone architecture of the courthouse. It was the third courthouse in Pittsfield and the fifth in Pike County. The building is of octagon shape 96 x 96 feet of Cleveland sandstone veneering, backed by heavy walls of brick; the dimensions over all, is over the steps and porches, is 119 feet by 119 feet. Four entrances, all exactly alike, face the four cardinal points \u2013 north, south, east, and west.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pikeil.org/hot_links!/pike_county_courthouse.php#.Xj-dkzFKiUk|title=Pike County Courthouse, Built in 1894, the Pike County Courthouse has dominated the square in Pittsfield for over 120 years|website=www.pikeil.org|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nThe entrances are large, double doors of oak and glass and are overhung with beautiful stone porches. The park in which the building stands is 340 feet square. There are four sidewalks leading up to the doors of the courthouse and a sidewalk circles the building. From the center of the building rise the graceful outlines of the tower and dome to an imposing height of 136 feet. The corridors, which cross under the dome are ten feet in width, with marbled tiled floors, wainscoting and frescoed ceilings. Standing on the lower floor in the center of the corridor under the dome and looking upward, one may observe a beautiful concave of colored lights which spans the vault of the rotunda at a point near the top of the main building. The dome roof is of red slate. Total cost of building and fixtures was $68,520. The Pike County Illinois Courthouse is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful courthouses in the state and the Midwest. The Pike County Illinois courthouse was the fifth courthouse designed by Mr Elliott who also designed the Greene County Courthouse (1891) in Carrollton, Illinois; Edgar County Courthouse (1891) in Paris, Illinois; Jersey County Courthouse (1893) in Jerseyville, Illinois; and DeWitt County Illinois Courthouse (1893) in Clinton, Illinois.

At the completion of the East School in 1866, it was one of the finest and largest buildings of its kind in the state and \"fulfilled the requirements of a modern school plant.\" Original blackboards were simply black paint on the plastered walls. Generally, they were completely around the room, including between the windows. The original building was heated by hot air piped from furnaces in the basement.

The land is riddled with streams and bottom lands mostly draining through the McGee Creek drainage basin into the Illinois River. Thus, the land around Pittsfield and Pike County is much more hilly and forested than the rest of the plains of central Illinois. This geography, combined with a relative lack of heavy development, make the areas around Pittsfield particularly suited to wildlife. Pittsfield regularly attracts large numbers of out-of-state game hunters, and Pike county consistently leads all other Illinois counties in the number of deer harvested during fall hunting seasons.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 637\n|1870= 1621\n|1880= 2104\n|1890= 2295\n|1900= 2293\n|1910= 2095\n|1920= 2129\n|1930= 2356\n|1940= 2884\n|1950= 3564\n|1960= 4089\n|1970= 4244\n|1980= 4170\n|1990= 4231\n|2000= 4211\n|2010= 4576\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4265\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 4,211 people, 1,805 households, and 1,126 families residing in the city.

These settlers were of old [[Yankee]] stock, that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who had founded and settled [[New England]] in the 1600s.  A group of settlers from [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] headed west and settled this region of [[Illinois]] in 1820.  When they arrived the area was a virgin wilderness, they constructed farms, roads and government buildings.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=lhwVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+pike+county#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20pike%20county&f=false |title = History of Pike County, Illinois: Together with Sketches of Its Cities, Villages and Townships, Educational, Religious, Civil, Military, and Political History; Portraits of Prominent Persons and Biographies of Representative Citizens.

As county seat, the town was one of the various places in central Illinois where Abraham Lincoln practiced law as part of the circuit court, working on 34 cases between 1839 and 1852. One local newspaper, now known as the ''Pike Press'', was then owned by another of Lincoln's future secretaries, [[John Nicolay]], and featured an editorial containing one of the first known suggestions of Lincoln as the Republican nominee for the presidency.\n\nPittsfield is the self-proclaimed \"Pork Capital\" of the Midwest, owing to the long history of pork production in the region, which fed into the large meat-packing industry of Chicago. Though agriculture in the region is no longer so dependent on pork, the town still hosts a yearly \"Pig Days\" festival.\n\nThe local high school football team, the Saukees, still holds the record for longest winning streak in the state, and the 21st longest in the country.  Starting with their season opening 6\u20130 win over North Greene in 1966, the Pittsfield Saukees reeled off 64 consecutive wins, which included 15 straight shutouts between 1969 and 1971. In 1970, the team outscored their opponents 341-0 and allowed negative rushing yards for the season. The streak extended all the way through to the second game of the 1973 season, when Pittsfield dropped a 12-0 decision to Winchester, Illinois.<ref>http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-17/sports/9710170087_1_pittsfield-high-school-illinois-big-deal</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maxpreps.com/list/all_time_streaks.aspx?gendersport=boys,football|title=Longest High School Football Winning Streaks - MaxPreps|website=www.maxpreps.com|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/high-school/ct-greatest-illinois-high-school-football-teams-spt-1119-20171118-story.html|title=The 32 greatest Illinois high school football teams of all time|last=Bannon|first=Will Larkin, Tim|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nPittsfield is the setting for [[Jamie Gilson]]'s book ''Hello, My Name is Scrambled Eggs''.

Four entrances, all exactly alike, face the four cardinal points \u2013 north, south, east, and west.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pikeil.org/hot_links!/pike_county_courthouse.php#.Xj-dkzFKiUk|title=Pike County Courthouse, Built in 1894, the Pike County Courthouse has dominated the square in Pittsfield for over 120 years|website=www.pikeil.org|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nThe entrances are large, double doors of oak and glass and are overhung with beautiful stone porches. The park in which the building stands is 340 feet square. There are four sidewalks leading up to the doors of the courthouse and a sidewalk circles the building. From the center of the building rise the graceful outlines of the tower and dome to an imposing height of 136 feet. The corridors, which cross under the dome are ten feet in width, with marbled tiled floors, wainscoting and frescoed ceilings. Standing on the lower floor in the center of the corridor under the dome and looking upward, one may observe a beautiful concave of colored lights which spans the vault of the rotunda at a point near the top of the main building. The dome roof is of red slate. Total cost of building and fixtures was $68,520. The Pike County Illinois Courthouse is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful courthouses in the state and the Midwest. The Pike County Illinois courthouse was the fifth courthouse designed by Mr Elliott who also designed the Greene County Courthouse (1891) in Carrollton, Illinois; Edgar County Courthouse (1891) in Paris, Illinois; Jersey County Courthouse (1893) in Jerseyville, Illinois; and DeWitt County Illinois Courthouse (1893) in Clinton, Illinois.

{"title_page": "Speed of sound", "text_new": "{{short description|Distance travelled during a unit of time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Sound measurements}}\n\nThe '''speed of sound''' is the distance travelled per unit time by a [[sound wave]] as it propagates through an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] medium. At {{convert|20|C|F}}, the speed of sound in air is about {{convert|343|m/s|km/h ft/s mph kn|0}}, or a kilometre in {{nobreak|2.9 s}} or a mile in {{nobreak|4.7 s}}. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a [[sound wave]] is propagating.\n\nThe speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]] depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.\n\nIn common everyday speech, ''speed of sound'' refers to the speed of sound waves in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in [[gas]]es; it travels faster in [[liquid]]s; and faster still in [[solids]]. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at {{nobreak|343 m/s}} in air; it travels at {{nobreak|1,481 m/s}} in [[water]] (almost 4.3 times as fast as in air); and at {{nobreak|5,120 m/s}} in iron (almost 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at {{convert|12000|m/s}}<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/soundv.html Speed of Sound]</ref>{{mdash}}about 35 times as fast as in air{{mdash}}which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.\n\nSound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a [[S-wave|shear wave]], which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in [[seismology]]. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]], [[shear modulus]] and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's [[Mach number]]. Objects moving at speeds greater than ''{{gaps|Mach|1}}'' are said to be traveling at [[supersonic]] speeds.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' includes a computation of the speed of sound in air as {{convert|979|ft/s|m/s|0}}.

This is longer than the standard \"international foot\" in common use today, which was officially defined in 1959 as 304.8&nbsp;mm.)\n\nDerham used a telescope from the tower of the [[church of St Laurence, Upminster]] to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half-second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including [[North Ockendon]] church. The distance was known by [[triangulation]], and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.<ref name=\"Tony Fox\">{{cite book\n| title = Essex Journal\n| last = Fox\n| first = Tony\n| pages = 12\u201316\n| year = 2003\n| publisher = Essex Arch & Hist Soc\n}}</ref>\n\n== Basic concepts ==\nThe transmission of sound can be illustrated by using a model consisting of an array of spherical objects interconnected by springs.\n\nIn real material terms, the spheres represent the material's molecules and the springs represent the [[Chemical bond|bonds]] between them. Sound passes through the system by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting the acoustic energy to neighboring spheres. This helps transmit the energy in-turn to the neighboring sphere's springs (bonds), and so on.\n\nThe speed of sound through the model depends on the [[stiffness]]/rigidity of the [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, and the mass of the spheres. As long as the spacing of the spheres remains constant, stiffer springs/bonds transmit energy quicker, while larger spheres transmit the energy slower.\n\nIn a real material, the stiffness of the springs is known as the \"[[elastic modulus]]\", and the mass corresponds to the material [[density]]. Given that all other things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), sound will travel slower in [[Sponge (material)|spongy material]]s, and faster in stiffer ones. Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nFor instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen-1|protium]]) gas than in heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, \"compression-type\" sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.\n\nSome textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with density. This notion is illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, they each have vastly different compressibility, which more than makes up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to ''slow'' sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.\n\nA practical example can be observed in Edinburgh when the \"One o' Clock Gun\" is fired at the eastern end of Edinburgh Castle. Standing at the base of the western end of the Castle Rock, the sound of the Gun can be heard through the rock, slightly before it arrives by the air route, partly delayed by the slightly longer route. It is particularly effective if a multi-gun salute such as for \"The Queen's Birthday\" is being fired.\n\n===Compression and shear waves===\n[[File:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|Pressure-pulse or compression-type wave ([[longitudinal wave]]) confined to a plane. This is the only type of sound wave that travels in fluids (gases and liquids). A pressure-type wave may also travel in solids, along with other types of waves ([[transverse wave]]s, see below)|alt=|305x305px]]\n[[File:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|[[Transverse wave]] affecting atoms initially confined to a plane. This additional type of sound wave (additional type of elastic wave) travels only in solids, for it requires a sideways shearing motion which is supported by the presence of elasticity in the solid. The sideways shearing motion may take place in '''any''' direction which is at right-angle to the direction of wave-travel (only one shear direction is shown here, at right angles to the plane). Furthermore, the right-angle shear direction may change over time and distance, resulting in different types of ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'' of shear-waves|alt=|305x305px]]\n\nIn a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A [[longitudinal wave]] is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the [[transverse wave]], also called a [[shear wave]], occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the \"[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]\" of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of [[orthogonal]] polarizations.\n\nThese different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an [[earthquake]], where sharp compression waves arrive first and rocking transverse waves seconds later.\n\nThe speed of a compression wave in a fluid is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]] and [[density]]. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of [[shear modulus]] which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\n==Equations==\nThe speed of sound in mathematical notation is conventionally represented by ''c'', from the Latin ''celeritas'' meaning \"velocity\".\n\nFor fluids in general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by the Newton\u2013Laplace equation:\n: <math>c = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_s}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere\n* ''K<sub>s</sub>'' is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic [[bulk modulus]] (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);\n* <math>\\rho</math> is the [[density]].\n\nThus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material and decreases with an increase in density. For ideal gases, the bulk modulus ''K'' is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless [[adiabatic index]], which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.\n\nFor general [[equations of state]], if [[classical mechanics]] is used, the speed of sound ''c'' can be derived<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-osuniversityphysics/chapter/17-2-speed-of-sound/|title=17.2 Speed of Sound {{!}} University Physics Volume 1|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> as follows:\n\nConsider the sound wave propagating through a pipe with cross-sectional area <math>A</math>. In time interval <math>dt</math> it moves through a tube of length <math>dz=vdt</math>.

This is because sound wave travels so fast that its propagation can be approximated as [[Adiabatic process#Various applications of the adiabatic assumption|adiabatic process]].\n\nIf [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the [[relativistic Euler equations]].\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|non-dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is independent of [[sound frequency]], so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> which ''is'' a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies ({{nobreak|> 28 [[kHz]]}}).<ref>Dean, E. A. (August 1979). [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA076060 Atmospheric Effects on the Speed of Sound], Technical report of Defense Technical Information Center</ref>\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the [[dispersion relation]]. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the [[phase velocity]], while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the [[group velocity]]. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see [[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|optical dispersion]] for a description.\n\n==Dependence on the properties of the medium==\nThe speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the [[shear modulus]]), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on [[compressibility]].\n\nIn fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the [[hot chocolate effect]].\n\nIn gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the [[heat capacity ratio]] (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of ''temperature and molecular structure'' important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).\n\nIn low [[molecular weight]] gases such as [[helium]], sound propagates faster as compared to heavier gases such as [[xenon]]. For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.\n\nFor a given [[ideal gas]] the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its [[temperature]]. At a constant temperature, the gas [[pressure]] has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and [[density]] (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density\u2014just as in liquids\u2014but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.\n\nIn non-ideal gas behavior regimen, for which the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]] equation would be used, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.\n\nHumidity has a small but measurable effect on the speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%\u20130.6%), because [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of [[water]]. This is a simple mixing effect.\n\n==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==\n[[File:Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. The speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]]\n\nIn the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the [[temperature]]. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent ''solely'' upon temperature; see [[Speed of sound#Details|Details]] below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.\n\nSince temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to {{nobreak|11 km}}, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.<ref name=\"Everest2001\">{{cite book\n| last = Everest\n| first = F.\n| title = The Master Handbook of Acoustics\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n| isbn = 978-0-07-136097-5\n| pages = 262\u2013263\n}}</ref> The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative [[sound speed gradient]].\n\nHowever, there are variations in this trend above {{nobreak|11 km}}. In particular, in the [[stratosphere]] above about {{nobreak|20 km}}, the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the [[ozone layer]]. This produces a positive speed of sound gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above {{nobreak|90 km}}.\n\n==Practical formula for dry air==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Speed of sound in dry air.svg|thumb|Approximation of the speed of sound in dry air based on the [[heat capacity ratio]] (in green) against the truncated [[Taylor expansion]] (in red).]]\n\nThe approximate speed of sound in dry (0% humidity) air, in metres per second, at temperatures near {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}, can be calculated from\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = (331.3 + 0.606 \\cdot \\vartheta)~~~\\mathrm{m/s},</math>\nwhere ''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' is the temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] (\u00b0C).\n<ref name=\"Bies2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Bies\n| first = D.A.\n| last2 = Hansen\n| first2 = C.H.\n| title = Engineering Noise Control - Theory and Practice, 4th Edition\n| publisher = CRC Press\n| location = New York\n| year = 2009\n| isbn = 978-0-415-48707-8\n| pages = 18\u201319\n}}</ref> \n\nThis equation is derived from the first two terms of the [[Taylor expansion]] of the following more accurate equation:\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 331.3~ \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\vartheta}{273.15}}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}.</math>\n\nDividing the first part, and multiplying the second part, on the right hand side, by {{radic|273.15}} gives the exactly equivalent form\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \\sqrt{\\vartheta + 273.15}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}.</math>\n\nwhich can also be written as\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{air}} = 20.05~ \\sqrt{T/K}~~~~\\mathrm{m/s}</math>\n\nwhere T denotes the [[thermodynamic temperature]].\n\nThe value of {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, which represents the speed at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} (or {{nobreak|273.15 K}}), is based on theoretical (and some measured) values of the [[heat capacity ratio]], ''\u03b3'', as well as on the fact that at 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] real air is very well described by the ideal gas approximation. Commonly found values for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} may vary from 331.2 to 331.6 due to the assumptions made when it is calculated. If ideal gas ''\u03b3'' is assumed to be {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}} exactly, the {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} speed is calculated (see section below) to be {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, the coefficient used above.\n\nThis equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low-pressure conditions, such as the Earth's [[stratosphere]]. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average [[mean free path]] between gas molecule collisions.

His result was missing the factor of ''\u03b3'' but was otherwise correct.\n\nNumerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of {{nobreak|1=''\u03b3'' = 1.4000}} requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy \"partition\" or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode, have energies too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in [[specific heat capacity]] for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.\n\nFor air, we introduce the shorthand\n: <math>R_* = R/M_{\\mathrm{air}}.</math>\nIn addition, we switch to the Celsius temperature {{nobreak|1=''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' = ''T'' \u2212 273.15}}, which is useful to calculate air speed in the region near \n0&nbsp;\u00b0C (about 273 kelvin).

Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere\u2014''actual conditions may vary''.\n\n{{Temperature_effect}}\n\nGiven normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|'''Altitude'''\n|'''Temperat\n|'''m/s'''\n|'''km/h'''\n|'''mph'''\n|'''kn'''\n|-\n|Sea level\n|{{nobreak|15&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|59&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|340\n|1,225\n|761\n|661\n|-\n|{{nobreak|11,000 m}}\u2212{{nobreak|20,000 m}}<br>(Cruising altitude of commercial jets,<br>and [[Bell X-1|first supersonic flight]])\n| {{nobreak|\u221257&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|\u221270&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|295\n|1,062\n|660\n|573\n|-\n|29,000 m (Flight of [[Boeing X-43|X-43A]])\n| {{nobreak|\u221248&nbsp;\u00b0C}} ({{nobreak|\u221253&nbsp;\u00b0F}})\n|301\n|1,083\n|673\n|585\n|}\n\n==Effect of frequency and gas composition==\n\n===General physical considerations===\nThe medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result, the speed of sound can vary with frequency.<ref>[[Albert Beaumont Wood|A B Wood]], A Textbook of Sound (Bell, London, 1946)</ref>\n\nThe limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the [[mean free path]] increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.<ref name=\"USSA1976\"/> The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the sound wave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.\n\nThe molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher ''\u03b3'' ({{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.66}}...) than diatomics do ({{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}}). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of\n: <math>{c_{\\mathrm{gas,monatomic}} \\over c_{\\mathrm{gas,diatomic}}} = \\sqrt{{{{5/3} \\over {7/5}}}} = \\sqrt{25 \\over 21} = 1.091\\ldots</math>\n\nThis gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in [[helium]] vs. [[deuterium]], each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).\n\nNote that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see [[heat capacity]]). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas give the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.\n\n===Practical application to air===\nBy far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about {{nobreak|0.6 m/s}} per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.\n\nThe speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about {{nobreak|1.5 m/s}} at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).\n\nThe dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about {{nobreak|0.1 m/s}} as the frequency rises from {{nobreak|10 Hz}} to {{nobreak|100 Hz}}. For audible frequencies above {{nobreak|100 Hz}} it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/SpeedofSound.html\n| title = Speed of Sound in Air\n| publisher = Phy.mtu.edu\n|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs shown above, the approximate value 1000/3 = 333.33... m/s is exact a little below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C and is a good approximation for all \"usual\" outside temperatures (in temperate climates, at least), hence the usual rule of thumb to determine how far lightning has struck: count the seconds from the start of the lightning flash to the start of the corresponding roll of thunder and divide by 3: the result is the distance in kilometers to the nearest point of the lightning bolt.\n\n==Mach number==\n{{Main|Mach number}}\n[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] traveling near the speed of sound.

At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.\nAircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a [[Pitot tube]] is dependent on altitude as well as speed.\n\n==Experimental methods==\nA range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.\n\nThe earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by [[William Derham]] and acknowledged by [[Isaac Newton]]. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upminster|Church of St Laurence]] in [[Upminster]], England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200\u2013400 metres, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.\n\n===Single-shot timing methods===\nThe simplest concept is the measurement made using two [[microphone]]s and a fast recording device such as a [[Digital data|digital]] storage scope. This method uses the following idea.\n\nIf a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:\n# The distance between the microphones (''x''), called microphone basis.\n# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (''t'').\n\nThen ''v'' = ''x''/''t''.\n\n===High-precision measurements in air===\nThe effect of impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical [[desiccant]]s can be used to dry the air, but will, in turn, contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review<ref>Zuckerwar, Handbook of the speed of sound in real gases, p. 52</ref> found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave \"the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date.\" The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at {{nobreak|30&nbsp;\u00b0C}} but corrected for temperature in order to report them at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}. The result was {{nobreak|331.45 \u00b1 0.01 m/s}} for dry air at STP, for frequencies from {{nobreak|93 Hz}} to {{nobreak|1,500 Hz}}.\n\n==Non-gaseous media==\n\n===Speed of sound in solids===\n\n====Three-dimensional solids====\nIn a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent\non the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In [[earthquake]]s, the corresponding seismic waves are called [[P-wave]]s (primary waves) and [[S-wave]]s (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by<ref name=\"E. Kinsler 2000\">L. E. Kinsler et al.

This is similar to the expression for shear waves, save that [[Young's modulus]] replaces the [[shear modulus]].

The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.\n\n==Gradients==\n{{Main|Sound speed gradient}}\nWhen sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean, there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or [[SOFAR channel]] which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.\n\nIn the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher [[refractive index|index]], sound waves will [[refraction|refract]] towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined to a sheet of glass or [[optical fiber]]. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.\n\nA similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. [[Project Mogul]] successfully used this effect to detect a [[nuclear explosion]] at a considerable distance.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acoustoelastic effect]]\n* [[Elastic wave]]\n* [[Second sound]]\n* [[Sonic boom]]\n* [[Sound barrier]]\n* [[Speeds of sound of the elements]]\n* [[Underwater acoustics]]\n* [[Vibrations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://e6bx.com/speed-of-sound/ Speed of Sound Calculator] \n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-speedsound.htm Calculation: Speed of Sound in Air and the Temperature]\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/SpeedOfSoundPressure.pdf Speed of sound: Temperature Matters, Not Air Pressure]\n* [http://www.pdas.com/atmos.html Properties of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976]\n* [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath109/kmath109.htm The Speed of Sound]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060429062028/http://www.bustertests.co.uk/answer/how-to-measure-the-speed-of-sound-in-a-laboratory/ How to Measure the Speed of Sound in a Laboratory]\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826504.200-did-sound-once-travel-at-light-speed.html Did Sound Once Travel at Light Speed?]\n* [http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Reference%20Information/matproperties.htm Acoustic Properties of Various Materials Including the Speed of Sound]\n* [http://www.dosits.org/ Discovery of Sound in the Sea] (uses of sound by humans and other animals)\n\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Sound]]\n[[Category:Sound measurements]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n[[Category:Velocity]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Distance travelled during a unit of time by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Sound measurements}}\n\nThe '''speed of sound''' is the distance travelled per unit time by a [[sound wave]] as it propagates through an [[elasticity (solid mechanics)|elastic]] medium. At {{convert|20|C|F}}, the speed of sound in air is about {{convert|343|m/s|km/h ft/s mph kn|0}}, or a kilometre in {{nobreak|2.9 s}} or a mile in {{nobreak|4.7 s}}. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a [[sound wave]] is propagating.\n\nThe speed of sound in an [[ideal gas]] depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.\n\nIn common everyday speech, ''speed of sound'' refers to the speed of sound waves in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in [[gas]]es; it travels faster in [[liquid]]s; and faster still in [[solids]]. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at {{nobreak|343 m/s}} in air; it travels at {{nobreak|1,481 m/s}} in [[water]] (almost 4.3 times as fast as in air); and at {{nobreak|5,120 m/s}} in iron (almost 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at {{convert|12000|m/s}}<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/soundv.html Speed of Sound]</ref>{{mdash}}about 35 times as fast as in air{{mdash}}which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.\n\nSound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a [[S-wave|shear wave]], which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in [[seismology]]. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]], [[shear modulus]] and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's [[Mach number]]. Objects moving at speeds greater than ''{{gaps|Mach|1}}'' are said to be traveling at [[supersonic]] speeds.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' includes a computation of the speed of sound in air as {{convert|979|ft/s|m/s|0}}.

Sound passes through the system by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting the acoustic energy to neighboring spheres. This helps transmit the energy in-turn to the neighboring sphere's springs (bonds), and so on.\n\nThe speed of sound through the model depends on the [[stiffness]]/rigidity of the [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, and the mass of the spheres. As long as the spacing of the spheres remains constant, stiffer springs/bonds transmit energy quicker, while larger spheres transmit the energy slower.\n\nIn a real material, the stiffness of the springs is known as the \"[[elastic modulus]]\", and the mass corresponds to the material [[density]]. Given that all other things being equal ([[ceteris paribus]]), sound will travel slower in [[Sponge (material)|spongy material]]s, and faster in stiffer ones. Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nFor instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen ([[Hydrogen-1|protium]]) gas than in heavy hydrogen ([[deuterium]]) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, \"compression-type\" sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.\n\nSome textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with density. This notion is illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, they each have vastly different compressibility, which more than makes up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to ''slow'' sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.\n\nA practical example can be observed in Edinburgh when the \"One o' Clock Gun\" is fired at the eastern end of Edinburgh Castle. Standing at the base of the western end of the Castle Rock, the sound of the Gun can be heard through the rock, slightly before it arrives by the air route, partly delayed by the slightly longer route. It is particularly effective if a multi-gun salute such as for \"The Queen's Birthday\" is being fired.\n\n===Compression and shear waves===\n[[File:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|Pressure-pulse or compression-type wave ([[longitudinal wave]]) confined to a plane. This is the only type of sound wave that travels in fluids (gases and liquids). A pressure-type wave may also travel in solids, along with other types of waves ([[transverse wave]]s, see below)|alt=|305x305px]]\n[[File:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|[[Transverse wave]] affecting atoms initially confined to a plane. This additional type of sound wave (additional type of elastic wave) travels only in solids, for it requires a sideways shearing motion which is supported by the presence of elasticity in the solid. The sideways shearing motion may take place in '''any''' direction which is at right-angle to the direction of wave-travel (only one shear direction is shown here, at right angles to the plane). Furthermore, the right-angle shear direction may change over time and distance, resulting in different types of ''[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]'' of shear-waves|alt=|305x305px]]\n\nIn a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A [[longitudinal wave]] is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the [[transverse wave]], also called a [[shear wave]], occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the \"[[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]\" of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of [[orthogonal]] polarizations.\n\nThese different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an [[earthquake]], where sharp compression waves arrive first and rocking transverse waves seconds later.\n\nThe speed of a compression wave in a fluid is determined by the medium's [[compressibility]] and [[density]]. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of [[shear modulus]] which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.\n\n==Equations==\nThe speed of sound in mathematical notation is conventionally represented by ''c'', from the Latin ''celeritas'' meaning \"velocity\".\n\nFor fluids in general, the speed of sound ''c'' is given by the Newton\u2013Laplace equation:\n: <math>c = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_s}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere\n* ''K<sub>s</sub>'' is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic [[bulk modulus]] (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);\n* <math>\\rho</math> is the [[density]].\n\nThus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material and decreases with an increase in density. For ideal gases, the bulk modulus ''K'' is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless [[adiabatic index]], which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.\n\nFor general [[equations of state]], if [[classical mechanics]] is used, the speed of sound ''c'' can be derived<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-osuniversityphysics/chapter/17-2-speed-of-sound/|title=17.2 Speed of Sound {{!}} University Physics Volume 1|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> as follows:\n\nConsider the sound wave propagating through a pipe with cross-sectional area <math>A</math>.

This is because sound wave travels so fast that its propagation can be approximated as [[Adiabatic process#Various applications of the adiabatic assumption|adiabatic process]].\n\nIf [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the [[relativistic Euler equations]].\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|non-dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is independent of [[sound frequency]], so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> which ''is'' a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequencies ({{nobreak|> 28 [[kHz]]}}).<ref>Dean, E. A. (August 1979). [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA076060 Atmospheric Effects on the Speed of Sound], Technical report of Defense Technical Information Center</ref>\n\nIn a [[Acoustic dispersion|dispersive medium]], the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the [[dispersion relation]]. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the [[phase velocity]], while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the [[group velocity]]. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see [[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|optical dispersion]] for a description.\n\n==Dependence on the properties of the medium==\nThe speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the [[shear modulus]]), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on [[compressibility]].\n\nIn fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the [[hot chocolate effect]].\n\nIn gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the [[heat capacity ratio]] (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of ''temperature and molecular structure'' important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).\n\nIn low [[molecular weight]] gases such as [[helium]], sound propagates faster as compared to heavier gases such as [[xenon]]. For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.\n\nFor a given [[ideal gas]] the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its [[temperature]]. At a constant temperature, the gas [[pressure]] has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and [[density]] (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density\u2014just as in liquids\u2014but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.\n\nIn non-ideal gas behavior regimen, for which the [[Van der Waals equation|van der Waals gas]] equation would be used, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.\n\nHumidity has a small but measurable effect on the speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%\u20130.6%), because [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of [[water]]. This is a simple mixing effect.\n\n==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==\n[[File:Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg|thumb|Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it since isolated density and pressure effects on the speed of sound cancel each other. The speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.]]\n\nIn the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the [[temperature]]. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent ''solely'' upon temperature; see [[Speed of sound#Details|Details]] below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.\n\nSince temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to {{nobreak|11 km}}, sound is [[refraction|refracted]] upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an [[acoustic shadow]] at some distance from the source.<ref name=\"Everest2001\">{{cite book\n| last = Everest\n| first = F.\n| title = The Master Handbook of Acoustics\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n| isbn = 978-0-07-136097-5\n| pages = 262\u2013263\n}}</ref> The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative [[sound speed gradient]].\n\nHowever, there are variations in this trend above {{nobreak|11 km}}.

Commonly found values for the speed of sound at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} may vary from 331.2 to 331.6 due to the assumptions made when it is calculated. If ideal gas ''\u03b3'' is assumed to be {{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}} exactly, the {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} speed is calculated (see section below) to be {{nobreak|331.3 m/s}}, the coefficient used above.\n\nThis equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low-pressure conditions, such as the Earth's [[stratosphere]]. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average [[mean free path]] between gas molecule collisions.

His result was missing the factor of ''\u03b3'' but was otherwise correct.\n\nNumerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of {{nobreak|1=''\u03b3'' = 1.4000}} requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy \"partition\" or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode, have energies too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in [[specific heat capacity]] for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.\n\nFor air, we introduce the shorthand\n: <math>R_* = R/M_{\\mathrm{air}}.</math>\nIn addition, we switch to the Celsius temperature {{nobreak|1=''<math>\\vartheta</math>'' = ''T'' \u2212 273.15}}, which is useful to calculate air speed in the region near \n0&nbsp;\u00b0C (about 273 kelvin).

Air is almost an ideal gas.

The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the [[mean free path]] increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.<ref name=\"USSA1976\"/> The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the sound wave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.\n\nThe molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher ''\u03b3'' ({{nobreak|1=5/3 = 1.66}}...) than diatomics do ({{nobreak|1=7/5 = 1.4}}). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of\n: <math>{c_{\\mathrm{gas,monatomic}} \\over c_{\\mathrm{gas,diatomic}}} = \\sqrt{{{{5/3} \\over {7/5}}}} = \\sqrt{25 \\over 21} = 1.091\\ldots</math>\n\nThis gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in [[helium]] vs. [[deuterium]], each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).\n\nNote that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see [[heat capacity]]). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas give the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.\n\n===Practical application to air===\nBy far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about {{nobreak|0.6 m/s}} per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.\n\nThe speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about {{nobreak|1.5 m/s}} at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).\n\nThe dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about {{nobreak|0.1 m/s}} as the frequency rises from {{nobreak|10 Hz}} to {{nobreak|100 Hz}}. For audible frequencies above {{nobreak|100 Hz}} it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/SpeedofSound.html\n| title = Speed of Sound in Air\n| publisher = Phy.mtu.edu\n|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs shown above, the approximate value 1000/3 = 333.33... m/s is exact a little below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C and is a good approximation for all \"usual\" outside temperatures (in temperate climates, at least), hence the usual rule of thumb to determine how far lightning has struck: count the seconds from the start of the lightning flash to the start of the corresponding roll of thunder and divide by 3: the result is the distance in kilometers to the nearest point of the lightning bolt.\n\n==Mach number==\n{{Main|Mach number}}\n[[File:FA-18 Hornet breaking sound barrier (7 July 1999) - filtered.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Navy [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] traveling near the speed of sound.

At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.\nAircraft [[flight instruments]], however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a [[Pitot tube]] is dependent on altitude as well as speed.\n\n==Experimental methods==\nA range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.\n\nThe earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by [[William Derham]] and acknowledged by [[Isaac Newton]]. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the [[Church of St Laurence, Upminster|Church of St Laurence]] in [[Upminster]], England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200\u2013400 metres, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.\n\n===Single-shot timing methods===\nThe simplest concept is the measurement made using two [[microphone]]s and a fast recording device such as a [[Digital data|digital]] storage scope. This method uses the following idea.\n\nIf a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:\n# The distance between the microphones (''x''), called microphone basis.\n# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (''t'').\n\nThen ''v'' = ''x''/''t''.\n\n===Other methods===\nIn these methods, the [[time]] measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time ([[frequency]]).\n\n[[Kundt's tube]] is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the [[Node (physics)|nodes]] and [[antinode]]s visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.\n\nA [[tuning fork]] can be held near the mouth of a long [[pipe (material)|pipe]] which is dipping into a barrel of [[water]]. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to ''(1 + 2''n'')\u03bb/4'' where ''n'' is an integer. As the [[antinode|antinodal]] point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.\n\nHere it is the case that ''v'' = ''f\u03bb''.\n\n===High-precision measurements in air===\nThe effect of impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical [[desiccant]]s can be used to dry the air, but will, in turn, contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review<ref>Zuckerwar, Handbook of the speed of sound in real gases, p. 52</ref> found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave \"the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date.\" The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at {{nobreak|30&nbsp;\u00b0C}} but corrected for temperature in order to report them at {{nobreak|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}}. The result was {{nobreak|331.45 \u00b1 0.01 m/s}} for dry air at STP, for frequencies from {{nobreak|93 Hz}} to {{nobreak|1,500 Hz}}.\n\n==Non-gaseous media==\n\n===Speed of sound in solids===\n\n====Three-dimensional solids====\nIn a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent\non the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In [[earthquake]]s, the corresponding seismic waves are called [[P-wave]]s (primary waves) and [[S-wave]]s (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by<ref name=\"E. Kinsler 2000\">L. E. Kinsler et al.

Note that the speed of pressure waves depends both on the pressure and shear resistance properties of the material, while the speed of shear waves depends on the shear properties only.\n\nTypically, pressure waves travel faster in materials than do shear waves, and in earthquakes this is the reason that the onset of an earthquake is often preceded by a quick upward-downward shock, before arrival of waves that produce a side-to-side motion. For example, for a typical steel alloy, {{nobreak|1=''K'' = 170 GPa}}, {{nobreak|1=''G'' = 80 GPa}} and {{nobreak|1=''\u03c1'' = 7,700&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>}}, yielding a compressional speed ''c''<sub>solid,p</sub> of {{nobreak|6,000 m/s}}.<ref name=\"E.

Krautkr\u00e4mer (1990), ''Ultrasonic testing of materials'', 4th fully revised edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, p. 497</ref> The shear speed ''c''<sub>solid,s</sub> is estimated at {{nobreak|3,200 m/s}} using the same numbers.\n\n====One-dimensional solids====\nThe speed of sound for pressure waves in stiff materials such as metals is sometimes given for \"long rods\" of the material in question, in which the speed is easier to measure. In rods where their diameter is shorter than a wavelength, the speed of pure pressure waves may be simplified and is given by:\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{solid}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere ''E'' is [[Young's modulus]]. This is similar to the expression for shear waves, save that [[Young's modulus]] replaces the [[shear modulus]]. This speed of sound for pressure waves in long rods will always be slightly less than the same speed in homogeneous 3-dimensional solids, and the ratio of the speeds in the two different types of objects depends on [[Poisson's ratio]] for the material.\n\n===Speed of sound in liquids===\n[[File:Speed of sound in water.svg|thumb|right|Speed of sound in water vs temperature.]]\nIn a fluid, the only non-zero [[stiffness]] is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces).\n\nHence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by\n: <math>c_{\\mathrm{fluid}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}},</math>\nwhere ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] of the fluid.\n\n====Water====\nIn fresh water, sound travels at about {{nobreak|1481 m/s}} at {{nobreak|20&nbsp;\u00b0C}} (see the External Links section below for online calculators).<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/sound-speed-water-d_598.html\n| title = Speed of Sound in Water at Temperatures between 32\u2013212 oF (0\u2013100 oC) \u2014 imperial and SI units\n| website = The Engineering Toolbox\n}}</ref> Applications of [[underwater acoustics|underwater sound]] can be found in [[sonar]], [[Underwater acoustics#Underwater communication|acoustic communication]] and [[acoustical oceanography]].\n\n====Seawater====\n{{see also|Sound speed profile}}\n[[File:Underwater speed of sound.svg|thumb|Speed of sound as a function of depth at a position north of Hawaii in the [[Pacific Ocean]] derived from the 2005 [[World Ocean Atlas]].

The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.\n\n==Gradients==\n{{Main|Sound speed gradient}}\nWhen sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean, there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or [[SOFAR channel]] which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.\n\nIn the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher [[refractive index|index]], sound waves will [[refraction|refract]] towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined to a sheet of glass or [[optical fiber]]. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.\n\nA similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. [[Project Mogul]] successfully used this effect to detect a [[nuclear explosion]] at a considerable distance.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Acoustoelastic effect]]\n* [[Elastic wave]]\n* [[Second sound]]\n* [[Sonic boom]]\n* [[Sound barrier]]\n* [[Speeds of sound of the elements]]\n* [[Underwater acoustics]]\n* [[Vibrations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://e6bx.com/speed-of-sound/ Speed of Sound Calculator] \n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-speedsound.htm Calculation: Speed of Sound in Air and the Temperature]\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/SpeedOfSoundPressure.pdf Speed of sound: Temperature Matters, Not Air Pressure]\n* [http://www.pdas.com/atmos.html Properties of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976]\n* [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath109/kmath109.htm The Speed of Sound]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060429062028/http://www.bustertests.co.uk/answer/how-to-measure-the-speed-of-sound-in-a-laboratory/ How to Measure the Speed of Sound in a Laboratory]\n* [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826504.200-did-sound-once-travel-at-light-speed.html Did Sound Once Travel at Light Speed?]\n* [http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Reference%20Information/matproperties.htm Acoustic Properties of Various Materials Including the Speed of Sound]\n* [http://www.dosits.org/ Discovery of Sound in the Sea] (uses of sound by humans and other animals)\n\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Sound]]\n[[Category:Sound measurements]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n[[Category:Velocity]]\n[[Category:Temporal rates]]\n", "name_user": "2601:181:4400:a290:144c:dcd1:b609:5042", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTables)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound"}
{"title_page": "Long take", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\nIn [[filmmaking]], a '''long take''' (also called '''continuous take''' or '''continuous shot''') is a [[shot (filming)|shot]] lasting much longer than the conventional editing pace either of the film itself or of films in general. Significant camera movement and elaborate blocking are often elements in long takes, but not necessarily so. The term \"long take\" should not be confused with the term \"[[long shot]]\", which refers to the distance between the camera and its subject and not to the temporal length of the shot itself. The length of a long take was originally limited to how much film a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]] could hold, but the advent of [[digital video]] has considerably lengthened the maximum potential length of a take.\n\n==Early examples==\nWhen filming ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), [[Alfred Hitchcock]] intended for the film to have the effect of one long continuous take, but the cameras available could hold not more than 1000 feet of [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]]. As a result, each take used up to a whole roll of film and lasts up to 10 minutes. Many takes end with a [[dolly shot]] to a featureless surface (such as the back of a character's jacket), with the following take beginning at the same point by zooming out. The entire film consists of only 11 shots.<ref>Miller, D. A. \"Anal ''Rope''\" in ''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories'', pp. 119\u2013172.

The term is usually used to refer to shots that constitute an entire scene. Such a shot may involve sophisticated camera movement. It is sometimes called by the French term ''plan-s\u00e9quence''. The use of the sequence shot allows for realistic or dramatically significant background and middle ground activity. Actors range about the set transacting their business while the camera shifts focus from one plane of depth to another and back again. Significant off-frame action is often followed with a moving camera, characteristically through a series of pans within a single continuous shot. An example of this is the first scene in the jury room of ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', where the jurors are getting settled into the room.\n\nAnother notable example occurs near the beginning of [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Antonioni]]'s [[The Passenger (1975 film)|''The Passenger'']], when [[Jack Nicholson]] exchanges passport photos while the audience hears a tape recording of an earlier conversation with a now dead man, and then the camera pans (no cut) to that earlier scene. \n\nAnother example is the famous \"Copacabana shot\" featured in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), in which Henry Hill ([[Ray Liotta]]) takes his girlfriend to a nightclub passing through the kitchen.\n\n==Average shot length==\nFilms can be quantitatively analyzed using the \"ASL\" (''[[average shot length]]''), a statistical measurement which divides the total length of the film by the number of shots.

Significant camera movement and elaborate blocking are often elements in long takes, but not necessarily so. The term \"long take\" should not be confused with the term \"[[long shot]]\", which refers to the distance between the camera and its subject and not to the temporal length of the shot itself. The length of a long take was originally limited to how much film a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]] could hold, but the advent of [[digital video]] has considerably lengthened the maximum potential length of a take.\n\n==Early examples==\nWhen filming ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), [[Alfred Hitchcock]] intended for the film to have the effect of one long continuous take, but the cameras available could hold not more than 1000 feet of [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]]. As a result, each take used up to a whole roll of film and lasts up to 10 minutes. Many takes end with a [[dolly shot]] to a featureless surface (such as the back of a character's jacket), with the following take beginning at the same point by zooming out. The entire film consists of only 11 shots.<ref>Miller, D. A. \"Anal ''Rope''\" in ''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories'', pp. 119\u2013172.

The shot begins with the bikers arriving to the drug den with McConaughey's character reluctantly in tow. The six-minute shot moves in and out of various residences, through several blocks and over a fence while shots are fired by shouting gangsters, bikers and police as they arrive on the scene. McConaughey at first assists the biker gang, then turns on them to abduct the leader, dragging him along for more than half of the continuous shot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/02/seitz-on-true-detectives-6-minute-tracking-shot.html|title=Seitz: Why True Detective\u2019s 6-Minute Tracking Shot Is More Than Just \u2018Awesome\u2019|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}</ref> Director [[Cary Joji Fukunaga|Cary Fukunaga]] commented to ''The Guardian'', \"We required the involvement of every single department, like a live theatre show.

The term is usually used to refer to shots that constitute an entire scene. Such a shot may involve sophisticated camera movement. It is sometimes called by the French term ''plan-s\u00e9quence''. The use of the sequence shot allows for realistic or dramatically significant background and middle ground activity. Actors range about the set transacting their business while the camera shifts focus from one plane of depth to another and back again. Significant off-frame action is often followed with a moving camera, characteristically through a series of pans within a single continuous shot. An example of this is the first scene in the jury room of ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', where the jurors are getting settled into the room.\n\nAnother notable example occurs near the beginning of [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Antonioni]]'s [[The Passenger (1975 film)|''The Passenger'']], when [[Jack Nicholson]] exchanges passport photos while the audience hears a tape recording of an earlier conversation with a now dead man, and then the camera pans (no cut) to that earlier scene. \n\nAnother example is the famous \"Copacabana shot\" featured in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), in which Henry Hill ([[Ray Liotta]]) takes his girlfriend to a nightclub passing through the kitchen.\n\n==Average shot length==\nFilms can be quantitatively analyzed using the \"ASL\" (''[[average shot length]]''), a statistical measurement which divides the total length of the film by the number of shots. For example, [[B\u00e9la Tarr]]'s film ''[[Werckmeister Harmonies]]'' is 149 minutes, and made up of 39 shots.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070908/REVIEWS08/70909001/1023 |title=RogerEbert.com : Great Movies: Werckmeister Harmonies |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 8 September 2007|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> Thus its ASL is 229.2 seconds.\n\nThe ASL is a relatively recent measure, devised by film scholar [[Barry Salt]] in the 1970s as a method of statistically analyzing the editing patterns both of individual films and of groups of films (for example, of the films made by a particular director or made in a particular period). Film scholars who have made use of ASL in their work include [[David Bordwell]] and Yuri Tsivian. Tsivian used the ASL as a tool for his analysis of [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (ASL 5.9 seconds) in a 2005 article.<ref>Yuri Tsivian, in ''The Griffith Project: Vol. 9: Films Produced in 1916\u20131918'',  Paolo Cherchi Usai (ed.), text at [http://www.cinemetrics.lv/tsivian.php Cinemetrics].</ref> Tsivian also helped launch a website called [http://www.cinemetrics.lv Cinemetrics], where visitors can measure, record, and read ASL statistics.\n\n==Directors known for long takes==\n<!--\nPlease include a reference for any addition to list.\n-------------------------------------------------------->\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n\n* [[Chantal Akerman]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmref.com/directors/dirpages/akerman.html |title=Chantal Akerman |publisher=Filmref.com |accessdate=29 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203080554/http://www.filmref.com/directors/dirpages/akerman.html |archive-date=3 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[B P Singh]]\n* [[Woody Allen]]\n* [[Robert Altman]]<ref name=\"bostonglobe\">{{cite news|first=Jake\n|last=Coyle\n|title='Atonement' brings the long tracking shot back into focus\n|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/29/atonement_brings_the_long_tracking_shot_back_into_focus/?page=1\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=29 December 2007\n|accessdate=29 December 2007 }}</ref>\n*[[Sanal Kumar Sasidharan]]\n* [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]<ref name=\"bostonglobe\"/>\n* [[Wes Anderson]]\n* [[Roy Andersson]]\n* [[Theo Angelopoulos]]<ref>[http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2016/the-12-best-directors-that-often-use-long-takes/2/ The 12 Best Directors That Often Use Long Takes - Taste of Cinema]</ref>\n* [[Hideaki Anno]]\n* [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]<ref name=\"bostonglobe\"/>\n* [[John Asher]]<ref>Greg Gilman.
