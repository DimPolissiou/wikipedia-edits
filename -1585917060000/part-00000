The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]] on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1.

Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737-300 wearing the airline's former livery, taking off at Leeds Bradford Airport in 2008]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]] on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]]  and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref> In 2007, sister company Jet2holidays was launched offering customers and travel agents [[Air Travel Organisers' Licensing|ATOL]] and [[ABTA \u2013 The Travel Association|ABTA]] protected [[Package tour|package holidays]].\n\nThe airline acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]]. In November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\". This preceded the announcement of opening a hub at [[East Midlands Airport]], the first of the airline's outside the North of England and Scotland.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit.

He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and as a producer at the BBC, where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an [[editing|editor]], as a director of magazines and publishing companies. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.

{"title_page": "Blancmange curve", "text_new": "[[File:Blancmange-function.svg|thumb|right|256px|Graph of the blancmange function]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''blancmange curve''' is a [[self-affinity|self-affine curve]] constructible by midpoint subdivision. It is also known as the  '''Takagi curve''', after [[Teiji Takagi]] who described it in 1901, or as the '''Takagi\u2013Landsberg curve''', a generalization of the curve named after Takagi and [[Georg Landsberg]]. The name ''blancmange'' comes from its resemblance to a [[Blancmange|pudding of the same name]]. It is a special case of the more general [[de Rham curve]].\n\n== Definition ==\nThe blancmange function is defined on the [[unit interval]] by\n\n: <math>{\\rm blanc}(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {s(2^{n}x)\\over 2^n},</math>\n\nwhere <math>s(x)</math> is the [[triangle wave]], defined by <math>s(x)=\\min_{n\\in{\\mathbf Z}}|x-n|</math>,\nthat is, <math>s(x)</math> is the distance from ''x'' to the nearest [[integer]].\n\nThe Takagi\u2013Landsberg curve is a slight generalization, given by\n\n: <math>T_w(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty w^n s(2^{n}x)</math>\n\nfor a parameter <math>w</math>; thus the blancmange curve is the case <math>w=1/2</math>.

Because the action is linear, it can be described in terms of a [[vector space]], with the [[vector space basis]]:\n\n:<math>1 \\mapsto e_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n:<math>x \\mapsto e_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n:<math>T_w \\mapsto e_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nIn this [[Group representation|representation]], the action of ''g'' and ''r'' are given by\n\n:<math>g=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 & w \\end{bmatrix}</math>\nand\n:<math>r=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThat is, the action of a general element <math>\\gamma</math> maps the blancmange curve on the unit interval [0,1] to a sub-interval <math>[m/2^p, n/2^p]</math> for some integers ''m'', ''n'', ''p''. The mapping is given exactly by <math>[\\gamma \\cdot T_w](x) = a + bx + cT_w(x)</math> where the values of ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be obtained directly by multiplying out the above matrices. That is:\n\n:<math>\\gamma=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\frac{m}{2^p} & a \\\\ 0 & \\frac{n-m}{2^p} & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nNote that <math>p=a_1+a_2+\\cdots +a_n</math> is immediate.\n\nThe monoid generated by ''g'' and ''r'' is sometimes called the '''dyadic monoid'''; it is a sub-monoid of the [[modular group]].  When discussing the modular group, the more common notation for ''g'' and ''r'' is ''T'' and ''S'', but that notation conflicts with the symbols used here.\n\nThe above three-dimensional representation is just one of many representations it can have; it shows that the blancmange curve is one possible realization of the action.  That is, there are representations for  any dimension, not just 3; some of these give the [[de Rham curve]]s.\n\n==Integrating the Blancmange curve==\nGiven that the [[integral]] of <math>{\\rm blanc}(x)</math> from 0 to 1 is 1/2, the identity <math>{\\rm blanc}(x)= {\\rm blanc}(2x)/2+s(x)</math> allows the integral over any interval to be computed by the following relation. The computation is recursive with computing time on the order of log of the accuracy required. Defining\n\n:<math>I(x) = \\int_0^x{\\rm blanc}(y)\\,dy</math>\none has that\n:<math>I(x) =\\begin{cases}\nI(2x)/4+x^2/2 & \\text{if } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1/2  \\\\\n1/2-I(1-x) & \\text{if } 1/2 \\le x \\le 1 \\\\\nn/2+I(x-n) & \\text{if } n \\le x \\le (n+1) \\\\\n\\end{cases}</math>\nThe [[definite integral]] is given by:\n:<math>\\int_a^b{\\rm blanc}(y)\\,dy = I(b) - I(a).</math>\n\nA more general expression can be obtained by defining\n:<math>S(x)=\\int_0^x s(y)dy = \\begin{cases} \n  x^2/ 2,  & 0 \\le x \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \n  - x^2 / 2 +x - 1/4,  & \\frac{1}{2} \\le x \\le 1 \\\\\n  n/4 + S(x-n), & (n \\le x \\le n+1)\n\\end{cases}</math>\nwhich, combined with the series representation, gives\n\n:<math>I_w(x)= \\int_0^x T_w(y) dy = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (w/2)^n S(2^n x)</math>\n\nNote that\n:<math>I_w(1)=\\frac{1}{4(1-w)}</math>\n\nThis integral is also self-similar on the unit interval, under an action of the dyadic monoid described in the section ''[[#Self similarity|Self similarity]]''. Here, the representation is 4-dimensional, having the basis <math>\\{1, x, x^2, I(x)\\}</math>.  Re-writing the above to make the action of ''g'' more clear: on the unit interval, one has\n\n:<math>[g\\cdot I_w](x) =  I_w\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = \\frac{x^2}{8} + \\frac{w}{2}I_w(x)</math>.\n\nFrom this, one can then immediately read off the [[generating set of a group|generators]] of the four-dimensional representation:\n\n:<math>g=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n  0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{8} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\frac{w}{2} \\end{bmatrix}</math>\nand\n:<math>r=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & \\frac{1}{4(1-w)} \\\\ 0 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\ \n      0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nRepeated integrals transform under a 5,6,... dimensional representation.\n\n== Relation to simplicial complexes ==\nLet\n: <math> N=\\binom{n_t}{t}+\\binom{n_{t-1}}{t-1}+\\ldots+\\binom{n_j}{j},\\quad\nn_t > n_{t-1} > \\ldots > n_j \\geq j\\geq 1. </math>\n\nDefine the Kruskal\u2013Katona function\n\n:<math>\n\\kappa_t(N)={n_t \\choose t+1} + {n_{t-1} \\choose t} + \\dots + {n_j \\choose j+1}.\n</math>\n\nThe [[Kruskal\u2013Katona theorem]] states that this is the minimum number of (''t''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-simplexes that are faces of a set of ''N'' ''t''-simplexes.\n\nAs ''t'' and ''N'' approach infinity,\n<math> \\kappa_t(N)-N </math> (suitably normalized) approaches the blancmange curve.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cantor function]] (also known as the Devil's staircase)\n* [[Minkowski's question mark function]]\n* [[Weierstrass function]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{mathworld|urlname=BlancmangeFunction|title=Blancmange Function}}\n* {{citation|first=Teiji |last=Takagi|title=A Simple Example of the Continuous Function without Derivative|journal= Proc.
