While he was walking through the territory of the Sosnovsky Park, he noticed two brothers, 11 and 12 years old respectively. Threatening them with a knife, the criminal took the children to a quiet, secluded place where he raped them, forcing them to drink something from a jar beforehand. As the boys later said, \"the liquid had a strange taste and an unpleasant smell.\" Both victims received serious bodily injuries.<ref name=\"\u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\">{{cite book| author = \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u041d. \u0421. | chapter = \u0412\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0430| title = \u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\u2026 \u0421\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044c: \u0425\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432 | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =   |location=  |year=  |publisher=  |at=  |volume=  |issue = | pages = | page =  | series =  | isbn = | ref = }}</ref>\n\nThe next attack occurred in the [[Kolpinsky District]] of St. Petersburg. While violently abusing a boy, Irtyshov squeezed his throat too much, causing him to die from suffocation. Igor himself later said that he did want to kill him, but simply did not calculate the strength, because he was drunk. After this, an active search was conducted to catch the serial rapist. Many criminals who were brought to criminal responsibility for such offenses were tried.\n\nThe next child Irtyshov raped was in May 1984. He dragged a 10-year-old boy into the attic of a house along the Riga Avenue and brutally raped him. After the act of violence, Igor broke the boy's hands, leaving him permanently disabled. It is noteworthy that all the attacks were committed in the daytime, approximately between 12 and 18 hours, but the perpetrator managed to escape unnoticed. A month later he raped two more boys, 11 and 12 years old, on the banks of the Neva River.\n\nThe seventh victim of the pedophile almost became a 15-year-old teenager, whom the criminal attacked in an elevator. However, the boy managed to fight back and escaped. On the same day, Igor, who was angry because of his failure, committed his eighth, and final, crime. After brutally raping a 9-year-old boy, he left the crime scene. The boy miraculously survived and was able to give a detailed description of the criminal. After that, he was put in a hospital in the [[United States]], with calls for financial help on the television for the necessary operation, but in spite of the fact that the necessary amount of intestines were collected for a [[organ transplantation]], the boy died. This crime, like the many others of Irtyshov, were committed in front of the victim's residence.<ref name=\"\u041f\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\">{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | url = | title = \u0423\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0441\u043a. \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u00a0\u2014 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u00a0\u2014 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 | orig-year = | agency = \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442.

Irtyshov was frightened: the composite was very similar to him, which forced him to fly to [[Murmansk]]. A month later, having decided that everything had quieted down, Igor returned to St. Petersburg, where on November 28, 1994, he was detained by law enforcement agencies, which by that time had amassed a vast amount of evidence against him.\n\nIrtyshov was \"given up\" by one of his lovers. After the last rape, Igor brought the boy's briefcase home and boasted about it to his roommate. He suspected something was amiss and turned to the police.

While he was walking through the territory of the Sosnovsky Park, he noticed two brothers, 11 and 12 years old respectively. Threatening them with a knife, the criminal took the children to a quiet, secluded place where he raped them, forcing them to drink something from a jar beforehand. As the boys later said, \"the liquid had a strange taste and an unpleasant smell.\" Both victims received serious bodily injuries.<ref name=\"\u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\">{{cite book| author = \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u041d. \u0421. | chapter = \u0412\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0430| title = \u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\u2026 \u0421\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044c: \u0425\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432 | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =   |location=  |year=  |publisher=  |at=  |volume=  |issue = | pages = | page =  | series =  | isbn = | ref = }}</ref>\n\nThe next attack occurred in the [[Kolpinsky District]] of St. Petersburg. While violently abusing a boy, Irtyshov squeezed his throat too much, causing him to die from suffocation. Igor himself later said that he did want to kill him, but simply did not calculate the strength, because he was drunk. After this, an active search was conducted to catch the serial rapist. Many criminals who were brought to criminal responsibility for such offenses were tried.\n\nThe next child Irtyshov raped was in May 1984. He dragged a 10-year-old boy into the attic of a house along the Riga Avenue and brutally raped him. After the act of violence, Igor broke the boy's hands, leaving him permanently disabled. It is noteworthy that all the attacks were committed in the daytime, approximately between 12 and 18 hours, but the perpetrator managed to escape unnoticed. A month later he raped two more boys, 11 and 12 years old, on the banks of the Neva River.\n\nThe seventh victim of the pedophile almost became a 15-year-old teenager, whom the criminal attacked in an elevator. However, the boy managed to fight back and escaped. On the same day, Igor, who was angry because of his failure, committed his eighth, and final, crime. After brutally raping a 9-year-old boy, he left the crime scene. The boy miraculously survived and was able to give a detailed description of the criminal. After that, he was put in a hospital in the [[United States]], with calls for financial help on the television for the necessary operation, but in spite of the fact that the necessary amount of intestines were collected for a [[organ transplantation]], the boy died. This crime, like the many others of Irtyshov, were committed in front of the victim's residence.<ref name=\"\u041f\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\">{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | url = | title = \u0423\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0441\u043a. \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u00a0\u2014 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u00a0\u2014 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 | orig-year = | agency = \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442.

Irtyshov was frightened: the composite was very similar to him, which forced him to fly to [[Murmansk]]. A month later, having decided that everything had quieted down, Igor returned to St. Petersburg, where on November 28, 1994, he was detained by law enforcement agencies, which by that time had amassed a vast amount of evidence against him.\n\nIrtyshov was \"given up\" by one of his lovers. After the last rape, Igor brought the boy's briefcase home and boasted about it to his roommate. He suspected something was amiss and turned to the police.
