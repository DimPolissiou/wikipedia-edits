{"title_page": "List of The Dark Tower characters", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Dark Tower'' characters}}\n[[The Dark Tower (series)|''The Dark Tower'']] is a series of eight novels written by American author [[Stephen King]], which incorporate multiple genres including fantasy, science fantasy, horror and western. Below are '''''The Dark Tower'' characters''' that come into play as the series progresses.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Protagonists==\n===Ka-tet of the Nineteen and/or Ninety and Nine===\n\n====Roland Deschain====\n{{Main|Roland Deschain}}\nRoland Deschain, son of Steven Deschain, was born in the Barony of Gilead, in In-World. Roland is the last surviving gunslinger, a man whose goal is finding and climbing to the top of the Dark Tower, purported to be the very center of existence, so that he may right the wrongs in his land. This quest is his obsession, monomania and [[geas]] to Roland: In the beginning the success of the quest is more important than the lives of his family and friends. He is a man who lacks imagination, and this is one of the stated reasons for his survival against all odds: he can not imagine anything other than surviving to find the Tower.\n\n====Eddie Dean====\nEdward Cantor \"Eddie\" Dean first appears in ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three|The Drawing of the Three]]'', in which Roland encounters three doors that open into the [[New York City]] of our world in different times. Through these doors, Roland draws companions who will join him on his quest, as the Man In Black foretold. The first to be drawn is Eddie Dean, a [[drug addict]] and a first-time [[cocaine]] [[drug mule|mule]]. Eddie lives with his older brother and fellow junkie Henry, whom Eddie reveres despite the corrupting influence Henry has had upon his life. Roland helps Eddie fight off a gang of mobsters for whom he was transporting the cocaine, but not before Eddie discovers that Henry has died from an overdose of [[heroin]] in the company of the aforementioned mobsters (after which the mobsters decide to chop off Henry's head). It is because of Eddie's heroin addiction that he is termed 'The Prisoner' (the inscription above the door Roland draws Eddie from).\n\nRoland also acquires medicine for his infection during the trip to Eddie's world, but this only temporarily quells the fever.\n\nEddie passes through the door into Roland's world, and faces heroin [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms, but despite his suffering, he also shows an affinity for the way of the gun\u2014and a good deal of what Roland calls 'steel'. Unwillingly at first, Eddie becomes Roland's companion through Mid-World, and he soon falls in love with Susannah, the next member of Roland's [[ka-tet]]. Eddie and Susannah consider themselves husband and wife, although they never formally marry.\n\nIn the final novel, during the attack on Algul Siento, Eddie is shot and killed by Pimli Prentiss, the master of the establishment.\n\nRoland also notes that Eddie's character strongly resembles that of Cuthbert, a gunslinger of Roland's past, and one of Roland's greatest friends. The character of Cuthbert is mentioned in Browning's poem and is described most fully in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass]]'', although he is first mentioned in ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]''.\n\n====Susannah Dean====\nAlso hailing from New York City, Susannah is a black woman (although as a woman of 1964, she prefers the term \"[[Negro]]\" over the term considered appropriate in Eddie's time, \"[[Black people|Black]]\") with two major afflictions: her legs below the knees were severed in a subway accident, and a childhood head injury left her with [[dissociative identity disorder|dual personalities]], which Eddie incorrectly labels [[schizophrenia]]. She is \"The Lady of Shadows\", the second companion predicted by Walter to be drawn into Roland's world via the mysterious doors.\n\nInitially, her dominant personality is that of Odetta Susannah Holmes, a well-mannered but priggish woman active in the [[civil rights]] movement. At times, however, she is taken over by Detta Susannah Walker\u2014murderously psychotic, incredibly crafty, completely unbreakable\u2014whom neither Eddie nor Roland can control. Neither Odetta nor Detta are aware of the existence of the other, and [[Confabulation|confabulate]] memories for the periods when they are not the dominant personality. Roland manages to resolve these personalities by forcing Detta to look through the third door while he himself looks out of it, forcing Detta and Odetta to see themselves for what they really are, and almost kill each other upon realising their presence. However, Odetta chooses to embrace Detta, and the personalities are integrated into a single, far more balanced individual, known as Susannah Dean, Eddie's wife, although they were never formally married. Susannah has access to the memories and personalities of both Holmes and Walker, and can call upon their skills and temperaments at will.\n\nDuring the drawing of Jake, she submits to sex with the demon of the doorway in order to distract it and afterwards, she becomes pregnant. Susannah shares the experience of her pregnancy with a demon-turned-mortal named Mia, resulting in Susannah housing yet another personality in her mind. Mia takes over Susannah's body (and melds with it, giving her legs for a short while) and runs in it to yet another ''when'' of New York, this one circa 1999, to give birth to the demon child.\n\nSusannah is the last member of Roland's ''ka-tet'' to leave him (and the only one to survive in a Keystone world), having been given the chance to return to another form of Eddie and Jake in a parallel world.\n\n====Jake Chambers====\nJake Chambers is an eleven-year-old boy from the New York of 1977, and is considered by Roland to be his \"true son\". Jake's given name is John, but he prefers to be known by Jake, and is called \"'Bama\" by his housekeeper, who is far closer to him than his parents. In his home world, he dies at the hands of Jack Mort (who Jake initially believes is [[Randall Flagg|Walter]]) and ends up in Roland's world as a result. The gunslinger and the boy travel together in pursuit of the Man in Black, developing a strong bond along the way. However, in order to reach the Man in Black, Roland lets Jake fall to his death.\n\nThe child Roland allowed to die reappears in Roland's mind in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]'' resulting in a [[paradox]]. Since Roland (in ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three|The Drawing of the Three]]'') prevented Mort from shoving Jake into traffic, he never died, therefore he never appeared in Mid-World and was never left to die under the mountains. Jake and Roland, however, can remember both timelines, and the knowledge is slowly driving them insane.\n\nIn the first half of ''The Waste Lands'', Roland's ka-tet figure out a way to draw Jake into Mid-world, where he belongs (an action which finishes the real Drawing of the Three, Jack Mort never having been intended to join the ka-tet). Eddie is driven to whittle a key out of wood as they approach a Speaking Ring, where Eddie draws another door into the ground, this one guarded by an invisible demon. Susannah distracts the demon by allowing it to copulate with her, while Eddie perfects the key and uses it to open the door. On the other side, Jake has been led by the younger version of Eddie who lived in that ''when'' to a [[haunted house]] (indeed, Eddie has vague memories of the encounter himself), filled with evil spirits and a horrendous gate-keeper. Jake, with some timely assistance from Roland, fights through them to reach the door. Once the boy is in Mid-World again, Roland's and Jake's memories are merged and their descent into insanity abated.\n\nOn the journey, Jake befriends a billy-bumbler who he calls Oy, who provides comfort for the boy on his quest. While crossing the desolate city of Lud, Jake is kidnapped by a deranged resident of the city. He allows himself to be taken in exchange for the rest of the group's safe passage, and Roland promises to come for Jake, despite having to abandon him temporarily. Despite the danger it poses, he rescues Jake with the help of Oy, reaffirming the father-son bond that has grown between them. Like Eddie and Susannah, Jake shows amazing aptitude to the way of a gunslinger.\n\nJake is the second member of the ka-tet to die, when he sacrifices himself to save Stephen King (as a character in the series) from certain death by putting himself between King and the van meant to take his life. By the end of the tale Jake has died a total of three times. An alternate version of Jake is encountered later by Susannah Dean; in this world, he and Eddie are brothers, with the last name Toren.\n\nRoland also notes that Jake strongly resembles Alain, another gunslinger, in his stable, reserved personality and talent with a [[psychic]] skill referred to as \"the touch.\" Alain is described mostly by his time with Roland as a teen in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''.\n\n====Oy====\nOy is a \"billy-bumbler,\" a strange creature found in [[Roland Deschain]]'s world. King describes Oy in the \"Argument\", or foreword, of the fourth book, ''[[Wizard and Glass]]''\u2014\"Bumblers, which look like a combination of badger, raccoon, and dog, have a limited speaking ability\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=XIII }}</ref> Elsewhere, bumblers are described as \"a combination raccoon and woodchuck, with a little dachshund thrown in.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 221] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 }}</ref> At one point, Eddie calls Oy \"a fucked-up weasel\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=636 }}</ref> Oy's voice is described as \"low and deep, almost a bark; the voice of an English footballer with a bad cold in his throat.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 221] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 }}</ref>\n\nRegarding Oy's appearance, by far the most frequently described feature throughout the series is his large, \"bright\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=60 }}</ref> almost glowing, \"intelligent, gold-ringed eyes\",<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=652 }}</ref> though King also frequently refers to the creature's \"disproportionately long,<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=16 }}</ref>\" \"surprisingly graceful neck\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 222] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 }}</ref> The creature has \"black- and grey-striped fur<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/220 220] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/220 }}</ref>\" and a \"furry corkscrew tail\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 222] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of their meeting, Roland concedes that Oy may quite possibly be meant as another member of their ka-tet. Later, in the 6th book, this is confirmed when the [[Tet Corporation]] forms as the association of \"Deschain, Dean, Dean, Chambers, and Oy.\"\n\nOy develops emotions and even a sense of humanity beyond that of his ability to replicate some words that the others speak. Oy is often referred as the smartest bumbler that characters have seen since the world had moved on. Oy provides a much-needed shelter from the harsh nature of the quest for Jake, often playing with him or providing moments of lightheartedness to the ka-tet. His deep loyalty to his friend saves Jake's life several times, and he remains part of Roland's ka-tet even after the boy dies, as a final request from Jake.\n\nOy is killed in the last Dark Tower book. He saves Roland's life by attacking Mordred, who came to kill Roland in his sleep. Mordred snaps Oy's back and impales him on a tree limb while the bumbler is defending his friend, but Oy finds enough strength to lick Roland's hand one time before he dies. Stephen King hints that Oy will be found in the same universe that Susannah travels to and will be in some form of a dog with \"odd, gold-ringed eyes and a bark that eerily resembles human speech.\"\n\n===Roland's original Ka-tet===\n====Cuthbert Allgood====\nCuthbert is Roland Deschain's childhood best friend, and a member of his original ka-tet. Roland and Cuthbert are described as having been playing together since they were toddlers. Cuthbert, often called Bert, is first featured in The Gunslinger, but he does not play a major role in the series until Wizard and Glass, the fourth volume in the series.\nCuthbert is characterized by his outwardly flippant, care-free view of the world. He constantly makes jokes, often testing the nerves of his companions. He is notably skilled with a sling-shot: it is said that he could 'take a bird on the wing at 50 yards' with it. This is a skill that comes in handy on many occasions in Mejias when the boys cannot openly carry their guns.\nCuthbert is quick-witted and sometimes has a way with words\u2014his proclivity for words can be noticed as he often stops to repeat and muse over phrases he finds to be nice and 'round'.\nPhysically, Cuthbert is described as being trim and tall with shoulder-length dark hair and dark eyes.\nDuring the battle of Jericho Hill, Cuthbert is shot through the eye by an arrow fired by Randall Flagg.\nIn Song of Susannah, Eddie Dean is revealed to be a reincarnation, or at least a \"twinner\" of Cuthbert Allgood.\n\n====Alain Johns====\nAlain is one of Roland's original [[ka-tet]], and along with the gunslinger and Cuthbert is evacuated to Mejias in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard, and Glass]]'' for safety, due to the ongoing war against [[John Farson]]. Alain is strong in the 'touch', which is the mid-world term for a combination of telepathy, precognition, and hypersensitivity to the guiding hand of Ka.\n\nAlain is described as being stout with blond hair. He is calm, reserved and often plays the role of level-headed mediator between ever pragmatic Roland and ostensibly care-free Cuthbert\u2014particularly when Susan Delgado is seen to be interfering with Roland's decision making.\n\nAfter Mejias, Alain joined Roland, Cuthbert, and Jamie on their quest for the Dark Tower.\n\nShortly before the battle of Jericho Hill, the last stand by the gunslingers of Gilead against Farson's men, Alain was accidentally killed by Roland and Cuthbert, who mistook him for an assassin in the night.\n\n====Jamie De Curry====\nJamie De Curry was a member of Roland Deschain's original ka-tet. He grew up and trained with Roland under Cort and Vannay in Gilead. He was the first to discover Roland's plan to attempt to finish his training (by fighting Cort, their veteran teacher) at the unprecedented age of 14. He is characterized by a birthmark on his face, leading some in Gilead to refer to him as \"Jamie of the marked face.\" He was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Jericho Hill while pushing Roland from the line of fire. It's stated by Roland that as a child he excelled in archery\u2014the use of a bow and 'bah' (crossbow)\u2014far more so than Roland himself, although by the time of the Battle of Jericho Hill he is a Gunslinger, like the rest of Roland's ka-tet.\n\nJamie figures prominently in the novel ''[[The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'', traveling with Roland to investigate rumors of a shape-changing \"skin-man\" that is attacking a frontier town. In this novel, his birthmark is described as being a deep red one on his hand, making it appear as if it has been dipped in blood, and he has the nickname \"Jamie Red-Hand.\"\n\n====Thomas Whitman====\nNot much is known about Thomas Whitman. He is only briefly mentioned in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' as one of Roland Deschain's childhood friends who studied under Cort. He is shown in several installments of the Gunslinger comics. He is shown to have a lean build with short, black hair. In the Battle of Jericho Hill, he and several other Gunslingers are killed by a flamethrower.\n\n===Allies of the Ka-tet===\n====Susan Delgado====\nSusan Delgado appears in ''Wizard and Glass'', the fourth book of the Dark Tower series. She is a resident of Hambry, in the Barony of Mejis, where the 14-year-old Roland and his ''ka-tet'' have been sent for their own safety. Susan's father was purportedly killed in a horseback riding accident, which Susan later learned was a murder premeditated by the town's leadership. Shortly before Roland's arrival Susan has been cajoled by her aunt Cordelia into becoming a concubine, or \"gilly\", for Mejis' mayor, Hart Thorin. Although Susan is to be paid for her services, she is a recognized consort and any heir she bears to the heretofore-childless Thorin will be considered legitimate. Before consummating her relationship with Thorin, however, she falls in love with Roland and becomes involved in the young gunslinger's plans to prevent [[John Farson]] from using an oilfield near Hambry to supply his troops with crude oil. When Roland and his friends are framed for Thorin's murder and arrested, she breaks them out of jail and helps them escape Hambry. Before she can flee, however, she is captured, brought back to town, and publicly burned at the stake as an alleged accomplice in the murder. At the time, she is already pregnant with Roland's first child. Roland is devastated by her death\u2014not just because of his love for her\u2014but because, when confronted with the choice of returning for her or setting out for the Dark Tower and thus saving all of creation, he chose the Tower, thus condemning her to death.\n\nRoland believes that Susan Delgado was the only ''true'' love of his life.\n\n====Ted Brautigan====\nTed Stevens Brautigan was introduced in the Stephen King novella \"Low Men in Yellow Coats\" from ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]''. He is a powerful \"Breaker\", a psychic, whose extraordinary powers as a facilitator are sought by the Crimson King so he can hasten the destruction of the beams and Dark Tower. Ted arrives in the [[Devar-Toi]], the prison camp where the Breakers are held, in 1955, and with help from Roland's old friend from Mejis, Sheemie Ruiz, soon escapes the Devar-Toi and enters the [[Connecticut]] of 1960, which is when the story of \"Low Men in Yellow Coats\" takes place. After his adventure in Connecticut, the low men capture and smuggle him back to the Devar-Toi via the Dixie Pig and Thunderclap Station. Ted meets Roland and his ka-tet in the final novel of the series, and he, Dinky Earnshaw, and the newly revealed psychic Sheemie assist the ka-tet in the attack on the Devar-Toi and ultimately succeed in obliterating the low men and the taheen. After Roland, Jake, and Oy travel to the Maine of 1999 to prevent [[#Stephen King|Stephen King]] from dying, Ted and his friends escort Susannah Dean to Fedic Station, and Ted, along with a handful of the other Breakers depart for the Callas, where they hope to first find redemption from the Calla folken and then return to America via the Doorway Cave.\n\n====Sheemie Ruiz====\nSheemie, introduced in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', was a mildly [[Mental retardation|mentally handicapped]] tavern boy at a saloon in Hambry. Sheemie assisted Roland and his first ka-tet in preventing the followers of [[John Farson]], and more specifically, the Crimson King, from reviving the Great Old Ones' war machines, later following the group back to Gilead. Sheemie joined Roland's ka-tet briefly and helped the gunslingers ward off the Crimson King's followers until he and his mule Capi mysteriously disappeared. However, while Roland assumes Sheemie is dead, he is not; he had been captured by the low men and taken to the Devar-Toi, the Breaker prison, because of his telepathic abilities, which remained unknown to Roland's ka-tet. He reappears in the series' final novel and assists the new ka-tet in defeating the low men and the taheen. However, during the battle, he steps on a piece of glass, causing an infection (accelerated by the \"poison air\" around Thunderclap). While escorting Susannah to Fedic on the train, he dies of blood poisoning. Although Susannah never learns this, she is indirectly responsible for his death, as it is her bullet that breaks the glass out of his window, causing it to be there for him to step on.\n\n====Dinky Earnshaw====\nRichard \"Dinky\" Earnshaw is the psychic assassin from Stephen King's short story \"[[Everything's Eventual (short story)|Everything's Eventual]].\" He was hired by a man named Mr. Sharpton who was the head of a [[List of The Dark Tower characters#North Central Positronics|North Central Positronics]] subsidiary. However, when Dinky discovered what Sharpton was truly using him for, he killed Sharpton. Unfortunately, the low men captured him and transported him to the Devar-Toi, where he later met Ted Brautigan and Sheemie Ruiz. The three joined forces with Roland and his ka-tet in the final novel of the series and they helped to defeat the Devar-Toi's guards.\n\n====Pere Donald Callahan====\n{{Main|Father Callahan}}\nDonald Frank Callahan is the \"damned\" priest who first appeared in the novel ''[['Salem's Lot]]''. He makes his first appearance in the Dark Tower series in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'', although his involvement in the series was hinted at in the afterword to ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''. After being marked by the vampire [[Kurt Barlow]], and therefore forced out of his church, Father Callahan spends time volunteering in a homeless shelter. Callahan made it a goal to get even with the vampires for what they did to him and his friend, who contracted [[HIV]] after being bitten by a vampire. He is aided in this by his ability to spot the vampires; since Jerusalem's Lot (and the forced ingestion of some of the vampire Barlow's blood) he has been able to recognize vampires on sight. Like Jake Chambers, Callahan enters Mid-World after dying in his own world, although in Callahan's case the death is his own doing; he jumps from a window to escape agents of the Crimson King, then arrives at the Way Station from ''The Gunslinger'', shortly after Jake & Roland left it. He becomes a partial member of the ka-tet, assisting the ka-tet in the Battle against the Wolves and Susannah's rescue mission from 1999 New York, and sacrificing himself so that Jake may live in the final stand in ''The Dark Tower VII'' against the can-toi (low men) and vampires. For the second time, Callahan kills himself before allowing himself to fall at the hands of the vampires.\n\n====Patrick Danville====\nPatrick appears in ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'' as a promising child artist, then again at the end of the Dark Tower series as a young adult artist with enough talent to shape the real world as he sees fit. As a young boy, he was prophesied to save two men in the future. He drew pictures of Roland and the roses as well. In the Dark Tower series, he was kept imprisoned for an unknown amount of time by the psychic vampire Dandelo and was rescued by Susannah and Roland. Patrick draws a door that allows Susannah to enter a parallel world, and later draws and erases a picture of the Crimson King, causing him to disappear from the Tower so that Roland can safely enter it.\n\n====Aunt Talitha Unwin====\n\"Aunt\" Talitha Unwin is a resident of River Crossing, near the city of Lud. When Roland Deschain came to River Crossing, she was 105 years old.\nShe and the people of River Crossing provided food and shelter for the ka-tet while they were on their way to Lud. Talitha gave her cross to Roland to lay at the base of the Dark Tower. It was given to John Cullum to act as a sigul and was later returned to Roland by Moses Carver.\n\nWhen Roland came to the Dark Tower, Talitha Unwin was one of the names that he called out and he remembered to place her cross at its base.\n\n====Cortland \"Cort\" Andrus====\nTeacher of Roland's original ka-tet. Roland earned his guns by defeating him with the hawk David, who was mortally wounded in that battle. After Roland's challenge, Cort laid in his cabin for a week in a coma, being tended by two nurses. Cort was often rough handed with his students, using physical punishment and denial of food to punish mistakes. He also fancied calling the prospective gunslingers \"maggots\". According to Roland, he is murdered soon after Roland's class graduates. He acts as a sort of a spiritual guide to Roland throughout the series, his voice and teachings popping up in the Gunslinger's mind every so often as Roland needs to reflect upon his training.\n\n====Abel Vannay====\nAlso known as \"Vannay the Wise\", he was the other primary tutor of Roland's ka-tet and of apprentice gunslingers. Known mostly for his wisdom and forbearance, Vannay's analytical method of instruction and pacifistic nature serve as strong counterpoints to the ruthless application of force and cynical thought process exercised by Cort. It is mentioned that he walks with the assistance of a black ironwood cane. His only known relative was his son Wallace, who played with Roland as a toddler; however, he died very young of an illness. Vannay would become one of the many victims to fall prey to the forces of [[John Farson]] in the battle for [[Gilead]].\n\n====Stephen King====\n{{See also|Stephen King}}\nStephen King (as a fictionalized character) appears in the final two Dark Tower books. Roland and his ka-tet learn of his existence when Roland comes across a copy of ''[[Salem's Lot]]'', after first meeting Father Callahan in the fifth book ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''. Roland and Eddie later confront King in his Maine home at a time when he has written ''<nowiki/>'Salem's Lot'' and ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' but no further Dark Tower books. Roland hypnotizes King and it is revealed that the author did not in fact \"create\" the characters of Father Callahan, or Roland, or any others involved with the Dark Tower, but Stephen King is in this reality a channel (another servant of the Beam / ka / Gan) that records their ongoing quest. It is also revealed that at a very young age, the Crimson King attempted to claim Stephen King as one of his own. King fears death and retaliation from the Crimson King if he continues to write Roland's tale but the Gunslinger's hypnosis encourages him to continue. The eventual attempt on King's life that would end his chronicling of Roland's quest comes in the form of his [[Stephen King#Car accident and thoughts of retirement|1999 automobile incident]].\n\nMany elements of Stephen King's real life are presented through his character (such as his 1999 accident) but are further fictionalized; King notes in the afterword to ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]'' that he took particular liberties with the geography of Maine to obscure the real-life location of his home and preserve what privacy he still has. Although he does not appear as a character until ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'', he is alluded to as early as ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three|The Drawing of the Three]]'' when Eddie recalls having seen ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' in movie theaters.\n\n====Stuttering Bill====\nStuttering Bill is a robot (full name '''William D-746541-M Maintenance Robot''' with many other functions) appearing in ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''. He plowed Tower Road all the way up to the edge of the white lands, where the snow ended and the roses began. He gave Roland, Susannah and Patrick a ride on his snowplow for many miles, taking them closer to the Dark Tower.\n\nStuttering Bill was also the nickname of [[Bill Denbrough (character)|William Denbrough]], one of the central characters in King's novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]''.\n\n====Calvin Tower====\nCalvin Tower is the lease holder of the Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind bookstore in the series. He makes his first appearance in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]'', where he sells Jake two books which later prove vital to the Ka-tet's survival of their encounter with Blaine the Mono. In later volumes, it is revealed that Tower owns the lot containing the rose, and is being pressured by mobsters to sell the property to the Sombra Corporation. Eddie saves Tower from a beating, and convinces Tower to sell the land to the ka-tet in the guise of the \"Tet Corporation\". Tower is an extremely reluctant recruit to the Ka-tet's cause, and his selfishness, obsessive addiction to acquiring rare books nearly derail the Ka-tet's efforts on several occasions. His eventual\u2014and reluctant\u2014decision to do the right thing comes largely thanks to the influence of his much more selfless, heroic friend, Aaron Deepneau. In the end, he sells the lot to Tet Corporation, and serves on the board for many years. With Deepneau, he saves Father Callahan from knife-wielding thugs. Tower dies of a heart attack in 1990.\n\n====Aaron Deepneau====\nAaron Deepneau is Calvin Tower's best\u2014and only\u2014friend. He serves as Tower's conscience, and steadily leads his friend to the gunslinger's cause. He later joins the board of Tet Corporation, and proves to be one of the rose's most ardent defenders. His grand-niece Nancy, a gunslinger in her own right, works for the Tet Corporation. Deepneau dies of cancer in 1992.\n\n====John Cullum====\nMet Roland and Eddie during the ambush in Stoneham, 1977. He leads the pair to safety, ferries them to his home, and provides a vehicle for them to use. He also becomes a member of Tet Corp's board and tireless champion of the rose, and dies for the cause, assassinated by Sombra/NCP in 1989.\n\n====Maturin====\nThe Guardians of the Beams keep watch over either end of the six beams that support The Dark Tower. Of the twelve Guardians the ones that are mentioned are Turtle, Bear, Fish, Wolf, Elephant, Rat, Bat, Lion, Horse, and Eagle; Maturin, the Turtle (also a character in ''It''), is considered the most powerful, or significant, of these. Throughout the series the reader repeatedly comes across a simple, nursery-rhyme style poem about Maturin:\n\n<blockquote><poem>See the TURTLE of enormous girth!\nOn his shell he holds the Earth,\nHis thought is slow but always kind;\nHe holds us all within his mind.\n\nOn his back the truth is carried,\nAnd there are love and duty married.\nHe loves the earth and loves the sea,\nAnd even loves a child like me.</poem></blockquote>\n\nMaturin guards the same beam as Shardik from the opposite end. Whereas Shardik runs amok in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]'', nearly killing Eddie before it can be destroyed, Maturin is a totally benevolent (and incredibly powerful) presence in the story, helping the ka-tet at several points along their journey.\n\nIn ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]'', a small ivory [[scrimshaw]] sculpture of Maturin comes into the ka-tet's possession, and with it, Susannah/Mia hypnotizes a stranger, forcing him to get Susannah/Mia a hotel room. Susannah leaves the turtle where Jake will find it, enabling him (and, through his own martyrdom, Pere Callahan) to track Susannah and escape the low men, taheen, and vampires in the Dixie Pig. The sculpture essentially holds any human (or can-toi) totally enrapt and compliant upon seeing it in the hands of its wielder. The carving is said to have a question-mark shaped scratch on its shell.\n\nAlso in books VI and VII, multiple characters stumble upon a small park near #2 Hammarskjold Plaza containing a fountain beside a bronze sculpture of a turtle. The park\u2014and the sculpture\u2014actually exist, although King places the park across the street from #2 Hammarskjold Plaza: In fact, the turtle is in a larger park directly alongside the building, part of the Katharine Hepburn Memorial Garden. The sculpture is a nod to the neighborhood's centuries-old nickname, Turtle Bay.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Turtle_fountain_-_Hammarskjold_Plaza_NYC.jpg]\n\nBoth Turtle Bay and Maturin the turtle appear in King's earlier novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', serving much the same benevolent supernatural guardian role.\n\nThe name Maturin itself is a reference to [[Stephen Maturin]], a naturalist from the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]] of novels who discovers a new species of tortoise.\n\n====Moses Carver====\nOdetta/Susannah's godfather and guardian, retired president of the Tet Corporation, and protector of the rose. When he finally appears in ''The Dark Tower'', he is 100 years old, with a fiery, mischievous, and extremely likable character. He has little gold framed glasses, a bad case of rheumatism, and a stooped posture; upon seeing him, Roland estimates that if he could stand straight, the two would be the same height (roughly 6'3\"). He is the last living founder of the corporation, and his daughter Marian serves as its president since his retirement in 1997.\n\n====Irene Tassenbaum====\nIrene is a middle-aged housewife from Staten Island, somewhat neglected by her wealthy husband, who meets Roland, Jake, and Oy in Stoneham, Maine of the Keystone World in the year 1999. She volunteers to drive the gunslinger's party to Lovell, where they narrowly manage to save Stephen King's life, with Jake sacrificing his own life in the process. Tassenbaum then drives Roland and Oy to New York (making love with Roland along the way), where the gunslinger and the bumbler meet with the board of Tet Corp. before returning to Mid-World. Irene promises Roland that she will plant a rose at Jake's grave.\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===John Farson===\nFarson, a.k.a. the Good Man, was a former thief, murderer, and harrier in the lands west of Gilead in Roland's youth, later becoming a general of rebellious people from the lesser classes of Mid-World. Followers, at his command, occupied Downland Baronies such as the Barony of Cressia, and after allying with the blue-faced barbarians of Grissom, they finally overwhelmed Gilead and the gunslingers. After the fall of Gilead and Farson's triumph, Roland and his old ka-tet fought for nine years against the remainder of Farson's forces, eventually leading to the battle of Jericho Hill. Farson sends his Generals Grissom and Walter O\u00b4Dim with the last two thousand soldiers and mutants against Roland, who was the only survivor.\nFarson is tall and slim, he has short, straight, black hair, brown eyes and wears black armor. He wears a terrible fright mask around his men.\n\nIn ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', a then-teenage Roland and his ''ka-tet'' uncover and stop a plot by Farson to use crude oil from fields in the Barony of Mejis to fuel his rebellion. Farson has recruited most of the Barony's elite to his cause. Roland later reflects that his actions only delayed the eventual fall of Gilead.\n\n===Randall Flagg===\n{{Main|Randall Flagg}}\n<!-- Please keep this brief, there is a main article for a reason... --->The Man in Black, and a character with numerous aliases, including: the Ageless Stranger, the Walking Dude, Walter O'Dim, Marten Broadcloak, Richard Faninn, Rudin Filaro, Legion, Covenant Man, and his given name, Walter Padick, son of Sam; he appears in many books of Stephen King, most notably in ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' and in ''[[The Stand]]'', always as a nearly demonic sorcerer. He is the [[Crimson King]]'s chief agent.\n\n===The Crimson King===\n{{Main|Crimson King}}\n<!-- Please keep this brief, there is a main article for a reason... --->\nThe ultimate in evil, this mysterious figure wishes to conquer the Dark Tower and raze it to the ground. Since this will destroy the entire multiverse, the Crimson King is naturally cast as the villain in ''The Dark Tower'' books. He is also known as Ram Aballah, and once ruled from his castle in End-World, but now is imprisoned on a balcony on the Dark Tower, to which he ran while in a fit of madness. He believes that when the Tower falls, he will rule the Todash darkness that was once the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. He is the one whom Walter/Flagg serves, whom the low men and taheen serve, and he has opposed Roland of Gilead from the beginning. The Crimson King is known by a number of names, including Los' the Red, Ram Aballah, The Aballah, The Kingfish, The Red King, The Lord of Spiders, and The Lord of Discordia. He also appears in [[Insomnia (novel)|''Insomnia'']] as a higher being trying to murder Patrick Danville as a child.\n\nThe Crimson King is also named in the Stephen King/Peter Straub novel [[Black House (novel)|''Black House'']], the sequel to [[The Talisman (King and Straub novel)|''The Talisman'']].\n\n===Jack Mort===\nJack Mort (whose name means \"Death\" in French) is a fictional character who makes a brief appearance in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'', and a more detailed appearance in ''[[The Drawing of the Three]]''. The third door that Roland encounters on the beach leads to Mort and New York in the mid-1970s. Roland finds himself inside the mind of \"The Pusher\", a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] named Jack Mort, whose [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] acts of random violence have shaped the lives of Roland's companions. Mort, an accountant, thrives on being a meticulous planner when it comes to murder. This, and his style of execution, leads him to be an anonymous and therefore very effective killer. For example, Mort will drop bricks (and presumably other heavy items) on people's heads from tall places (what he calls \"depth charging\"), will push people in front of cars, and will also push people in front of subway trains. His methods allow a complete lack of direct confrontation, and thus allow him to continue his secret life quietly and with deadly effectiveness. He acts as a linking point between Susannah (both Odetta and Detta), Jake, and ultimately Roland. When Odetta was five, Mort dropped a brick on her head (which led to the emergence of her [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]); he also pushed Odetta in front of a subway car when she was a teenager (neither knowing nor caring that she was a previous victim of his cruelty). On the day Roland enters him, he is planning to shove a young boy (who turns out to be Jake Chambers) into traffic. Unwilling to let Jake die once again through his inaction, Roland takes control of Mort's body and stops him. This death was the means that forced Jake into Roland's world the first time; when Roland prevented it, it had caused a [[time paradox]], though it was resolved later, or rather, undermined, when Jake entered into Roland's world again, but through a door. Later, Roland purposefully forces Jack Mort to throw himself burning in front of a subway train, while telling him that he deserves a far worse fate. In the midst of this struggle, Roland manages to trick Detta into looking through the door, which forces both Odetta and Detta to acknowledge their dual personalities and the cause of them. Mort is described as tall, thin, and having blonde hair in ''The Drawing of the Three'', yet is said by Roland to have had dark hair when mentioned in ''[[The Waste Lands]]''.\n\n===Blaine the Mono===\nBlaine the Mono is a demented monorail train appearing in ''[[The Waste Lands]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''. Originally serving as public transit in the city of Lud with his partner Patricia, another monorail with female characteristics, he slowly went insane after the world went into decline and the despondent female monorail committed suicide. Roland and his ka-tet have to ride this psychopathic train in order to travel safely from Lud to [[Topeka]] so they can continue their journey toward the Dark Tower. The train seems to be connected to the children's book found by Jake, Charlie the Choo-Choo. Before Blaine lets Roland and his ka-tet on board, he kills every single living thing in the city of Lud with poison gas.\n\nBlaine reveals to the ka-tet that he plans to derail in Topeka, destroying himself and killing them, but accepts Roland's challenge to a riddle contest for a chance at the survival of the ka-tet. If Blaine cannot answer every riddle put to him by the ka-tet, he will let them depart safely once they reach Topeka. It becomes clear that Blaine has a huge library of riddles from many different levels of the tower at his disposal, and programs to decipher plays on words or hidden clues, so the game seems doomed. Eddie eventually stumps Blaine with unsolvable \"riddles\" that are actually stupid jokes sometimes told by humans. This forces Blaine to try to \"lower\" his intelligence to levels necessary to answer, which ends up driving him completely insane and causes his computer to crash. Eddie then proceeds to shoot Blaine's main computer, causing a crash that destroys Blaine but leaves the ka-tet with only minor injuries.\n\n===Shardik===\n'''Shardik''' is a character encountered by [[Roland of Gilead|Roland]] and his [[Ka (Dark Tower)|ka-tet]] in the novel ''[[The Waste Lands]]''.\n\nShardik, while appearing to be a massive [[bear]], is actually a mechanical construct of [[List of The Dark Tower characters#North Central Positronics|North Central Positronics]]. A [[cyborg]], Shardik was built by North Central Positronics to serve as one of the twelve Guardians of the Beams. At the time that he is encountered by Roland, he is several thousand years old, malfunctioning, slowly dying, and infested with parasites (a reference to [[Richard Adams]]'s novel ''[[Shardik]]''). Driven insane by his illness, he attacks Roland and his ka-tet, and they are forced to kill him.\n\nThe Guardians of the Beams keep watch over either end of the six beams that support The Dark Tower. Of the twelve Guardians the ones that are mentioned are Turtle, Bear, Fish, Wolf, Elephant, Rat, Bat, Lion, Horse, and Eagle; Maturin, the Turtle (also a character in ''[[It (novel)|It]]''), is considered the most powerful, or significant, of these. By the time Roland was growing up, the Guardians had reached a near-mythic status, and he wasn't sure whether they even existed before running into Shardik.\n\nThe original Guardians, like so many other elements of Roland's world, may have been [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] entities that were replaced by North Central Positronic's technological constructs. The death of Shardik represents another failure of technology and is one more step in the dismantling of not only Roland's world, but the entire [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of existence.\n\n''[[Shardik]]'' is also a novel by [[Richard Adams]]; King took the name from this book, something some members of Roland's ka-tet recognize: Susannah realizes the source of the name (although the book was published a decade after the year she was drawn from), while Eddie mentions that he thinks of rabbits when he hears the name Shardik\u2014a reference to ''[[Watership Down]]'', another of Adams' books. Adams' Shardik, like King's, is a giant bear.\n\n===Rhea===\nA decrepit old witch, Rhea Dubativo, also known as Rhea of the C\u00f6os, was the one responsible for the death of Roland's true love, Susan Delgado. She owned a 6 legged mutant cat called Musty and a venomous snake called Ermot. She was entrusted with the pink Wizard's Glass (known as Merlin's Grapefruit), which slowly drained her and drove her insane, similar to the deterioration of [[Gollum|Smeagol/Gollum]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Readers never find out what happens to her; although Roland implies that he killed her, nothing more is elaborated upon beyond that. She is seen in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''; however, is mentioned in ''[[The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger|The Gunslinger]]'' prior to her appearance in the series.\n\n===Eldred Jonas===\nThe main antagonist of ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', Eldred is a failed gunslinger now in service to the Crimson King. He leads a gang called the Big Coffin Hunters. Eldred, though in charge of the Red's operations in Mejis, is answerable to George Latigo (one of John Farson's chief lieutenants) and [[Randall Flagg]] (at this time known as Walter), Farson's personal wizard. Briefly mentioned by Sheb in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''.\n\n===Roy Depape===\nArguably the shortest-tempered of the Big Coffin Hunters, Roy Depape's hot-headedness is one of the major catalysts for events in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''; through threatening Sheemie Ruiz following a mishap in the local tavern, Roy sets off a multi-layered [[Mexican standoff]] between [[Roland Deschain|Roland's]] original ka-tet and the Big Coffin Hunters. Though the situation is initially resolved with diplomacy, the event reveals to Jonas the true nature of Roland and his friends (who were hiding incognito in Mejis under aliases) and blows their cover. When the Big Coffin Hunters frame the young Gunslingers for murder he kills mayor Hart Thorin and plants the rook's skull that ties Cuthbert and by extension Roland and Alain to the crime. He was killed by Roland when the three young gunslingers attacked Eldred and his thirty men, who were riding to meet George Latigo.\n\n===Clay Reynolds===\nClay Reynolds is Eldred Jonas' right-hand man and the quietest of the Big Coffin Hunters. He is described as red-haired and especially handsome, and has a reputation as a ladies' man. His most notable accessory (besides his pistol) is a long red cloak. When the Hunters are framing Roland and his friends he volunteers to kill Kimba Rimer with a long dagger he bought for the occasion, in revenge for a comment Rimer made about his cloak. During the ensuing confusion that transpires near the end of ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', Clay escapes from Mejis with Coral Thorin, and the two become a bandit couple. King first cites Reynolds as having red hair, then changes it to dark (brown/black), then references Depape as being \"be-spectacled and red-haired\" several times. Roland mentions that both Reynolds and Coral Thorin were killed in a failed robbery several years after the events of Mejis. In the comic series ''[[The Dark Tower: The Long Road Home]]'', Reynolds is seen leading a possee of Mejis citizens in pursuit of Roland's Ka-tet, which they break off when Cuthbert Allgood cuts a rope bridge over a wild river. In the one shot issue ''[[The Dark Tower: The Sorcerer]]'', Reynolds is seen being whipped by John Farson for losing Maerlyn's Grapefruit while Coral Thorin waits outside Farson's tent.\n\n===Coral Thorin===\nCoral is the traitorous sister of Mejis' mayor, Hart Thorin. Mature and slender, she catches the eye of both Eldred Jonas and Clay Reynolds. Crafty and intelligent, Coral is able to ascertain that Jonas is indeed working for John Farson and, not wanting to be on the losing side, conspires with and aids Jonas in his dealing in Mejis. The two enter into a sexual relationship, but following Jonas' death Coral becomes the lover and cohort of Clay Reynolds.\n\n===Cordelia Delgado===\nCordelia Delgado was Susan Delgado's aunt, who sold her to Mayor Thorin as a \"gilly\". She has no problem selling Susan for money. Cordelia has a short temper and has fits where she becomes enraged and screams at Susan. When Cordelia learns that Susan has lost her virginity to Roland and not Hart Thorin, she becomes enraged and slowly loses her mind. Towards the end of the book, she has gone completely insane and joins Rhea in killing Susan. Cordelia is the first person to light the pyre that sets Susan on fire; Rhea is second. Shortly after killing Susan Delgado, Cordelia has a stroke and dies.\n\n===Mia===\nAn invading spirit who [[Spirit possession|possesses]] Susannah Dean's body in ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''. Originally an immortal spirit similar to a [[succubus]], she saw and fell in love with a baby and longed to have one of her own (an unknown force kept her from coming too close to the child she loved and taking it for herself). Long after a plague ravaged the town of Fedic and the child was taken away, Mia struck a bargain with Walter/Flagg. If she would give up her formless immortality, Walter would give her a baby. Mia's purpose in Walter's and the Crimson King's plan is to bear Roland's child; prophecy has foretold that this child will be Roland's doom.\n\nMia called the child her \"chap\", and it was carried by both Susannah and Mia. Susannah had become pregnant with Roland's seed from the demon she copulated with in ''[[The Waste Lands]]'', during Jake's Drawing. The demon, a hermaphrodite able to change its sex, had copulated previously with Roland as a female in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' while Roland protected Jake and queried it for information. The demon had somehow preserved Roland's semen (and allowed it to be somehow mixed with that of the Crimson King's seed) and impregnated Susannah with it while male. Mia possessed Susannah in order to take over the birthing of her \"chap\".\n\nMia is killed and eaten by her child, Mordred, shortly after giving birth.\n\n===Mordred Deschain===\nSon of two fathers and two mothers, Mordred was born of Susannah's egg fertilized by the seed of both Roland of Gilead and the Crimson King, and carried to term by Mia. Mordred is half-human, half-spider, able to transform between the two, and if his fate is fulfilled, he will both kill Roland and topple the Dark Tower itself. He is both very powerful and extremely arrogant. Growing at a rapid speed, Mordred passes from childhood through adolescence in a matter of months. His abilities include the ability to change between human form and spider form at will and absorbing a victim's knowledge and experience by devouring them. Mordred becomes deathly ill after eating poisoned horse meat, and when he makes a final attempt to kill Roland, he is attacked by Oy. Oy is able to distract Mordred long enough to allow Roland to wake up and kill his son at the threshold of the Dark Tower.\n\n===Richard Patrick Sayre===\nRichard Patrick Sayre is a high-ranking can-toi and a member of the Sombra Corporation. Like the other members of his race, he dresses in garishly colored clothing and has a raw spot on his forehead that continually wells up with blood without scabbing or spilling down his face.\n \nAs revealed in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'', Sayre lured Father Callahan to Sombra's offices by offering a million dollars to the charity he was working for. It was a trap, where Sayre intended to use Type Three vampires to give Callahan AIDS. His plan failed when Callahan committed suicide by jumping out the window.\n\nIn ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]'', Sayre is the man in charge of delivering Mia's baby. He calls Susannah/Mia in their hotel room, telling them to go to the Dixie Pig. He takes them through the door into Fedic, where Mia is placed on a bed to deliver Mordred Deschain. After his birth, Susannah grabs a gun and shoots Sayre in the head.\n\nIn the [[The Dark Tower (2017 film)|film adaptation of The Dark Tower]] from 2017, Sayre is played by [[Jackie Earl Haley]].\n\n===Finli O'Tego===\nFinli O'Tego is a weasel-headed [[Taheen]] that appeared in the fifth and seventh ''Dark Tower'' books; he was referred to briefly in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'', before reemerging as a fully fleshed out character in ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nFinli is an assistant and close friend to [[Pimli Prentiss]] and helped in the running of [[Devar-Toi]]. Like most Taheen, he has psychic abilities; he also enjoys eating pus, offered by Prentiss as he breaks the pimples that erupt on his face. He is credited with orchestrating the re-capture of [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Ted Brautigan]], an event described in [[Hearts in Atlantis]]. During the siege of Algul Siento by Roland's ka-tet, Finli was mortally injured and ultimately put out of his misery by [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]].\n\n===Enrico Balazar===\nEnrico Balazar is a New York criminal kingpin first introduced in ''[[The Drawing of the Three]]''. He manages a club called \"The Leaning Tower\" and has a fascination with building houses of cards on his desk. Among his actions in the series are: kidnapping Eddie Dean's older brother, Henry (who in turn overdoses on heroin before he can be saved), running over Jake with his car and killing him for the first time, and hiring out his musclemen to the Sombra Corporation. Enrico is killed by Eddie and Roland in Dark Tower II, but a parallel-earth version of him is alive and mentioned in books VI and VII.\n\n===Jack Andolini===\nJack Andolini is a New York gangster and affiliate of Enrico Balazar, whom readers first met in ''[[The Drawing of the Three]]''. In that novel, he followed Eddie and Roland from Earth to Mid-World (via magic door) and was promptly eaten alive by lobstrosities (after suffering major wounds to his face and arm during gunplay with Roland). He reappears, first in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'' and later in ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'' as a representative of the Sombra Corporation, in a parallel-earth, 1977. When Roland and Eddie enter the Maine of 1977, Andolini and his gang ambush them at the East Stoneham General Store. This version of Andolini meets a less horrible fate: he is imprisoned in a Maine county jail.\n\n===Dandelo===\nDandelo is a psychic vampire who feeds on emotions. He makes an appearance in the final book in the series, ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''. Using the name of 'Joe Collins', he lures Roland and Susannah into his cottage on Odd Lane (the street that crosses Tower Road in the White Lands of Empathica, and an anagram of \"Dandelo\") and treats them to a feast. Afterward, he tells them that before entering All-World, he was a stand-up comedian. Roland asks to hear some of his act, during which Dandelo comes close to making Roland laugh to death. Susannah avoids entrapment because she is in the bathroom at the time, tending to a troublesome sore on her face. There she discovers a note apparently left by Stephen King himself (the note even acknowledges itself as a [[deus ex machina]]) that helps her puzzle out Joe's true identity. Before he can sap all of Roland's life force, Dandelo is killed by Susannah with two shots to the head.\n\nIt is later revealed that he had kept [[Patrick Danville]] captive as a 'food source' to drain of emotions; at one point Dandelo ripped out Danville's tongue, preventing him from speaking.\n\n===Lippy===\nDandelo had a stable behind his house, in which he kept a blind [[horse]] named Lippy. Lippy whinnied when she sensed Roland, Susannah and Oy approach. She was very old, ragged, and had holes in her coat. When Dandelo is slain by the gunslingers, Lippy flees her stable, but returns to seek shelter from a winter storm\u2014only to be shot down by Roland. After the gunslingers have moved on, [[Mordred Deschain]], starving after weathering the storm out in the wilderness, fed on Lippy's corpse, which poisoned him and eventually contributed to his downfall.\n\n===Tick-Tock Man===\nThe Tick-Tock Man (real name Andrew Quick) is the leader of the Grays of Lud. He first appears in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]''.\n\nHe is the great-grandson of David Quick. His left eye was punctured by Oy during a fight, and Jake shot him in the leg, and then in the head with a .22 pistol. He was left for dead, but survived, the bullet having only grazed his skull and torn off a flap of skin. In ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', Randall Flagg rescues him and takes him to the Emerald Palace, where he attacks Roland's ka-tet, and is shot and killed by Eddie and Susannah. He seems to be a successor to the Trashcan Man from ''[[The Stand]]'', as both were followers of Flagg who repeated the mantra \"My life for you\" in regard to their loyalty to him.\n\n===Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions)===\nAndy was one of the main antagonists in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]''. Andy was created by Lamerk Industries (the same company that made the Twelve Guardians) and had lived in the Calla for thousands of years. He was obsessed with telling people their horoscopes, like Blaine the Mono was obsessed with riddles. Andy played music from a speaker in his chest and was loved by all the children in the Calla. He used this closeness with children to gather information and the whereabouts of the children of the Calla to Finli O'Tego. The information was used so that the Wolves, who were really robots disguised as monsters, could locate the children and take them into the Thunderclap. Andy's sinister nature was uncovered by [[Jake Chambers]], who hid in an ancient control center and overheard Andy talking to Ben Slightman Sr. about the Wolves. Andy claimed he didn't know much about the Wolves (under Directive Nineteen), but he always told the townsfolk when they were coming a month in advance. Andy was finally put to rest by Eddie, who blinded him by shooting his eyes out and then ordering him to shut down under Directive Nineteen. Andy was buried underneath a pile of manure in an outhouse.\n\n===Pimli Prentiss===\nPimli Prentiss is the warden of [[Devar-Toi|Algul Siento]]. He is described as being tall, overweight, and balding. Pimli Prentiss (born \"Paul Prentiss\"; he adopted the taheen name Pimli during his induction ceremony) was recruited by the Crimson King to run Algul Siento, the Crimson King's prison for [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Breakers]]. He got the job by replying to a help wanted advertisement in a daily newspaper. Pimli was not a resident of the plane that Algul Siento existed on, but a parallel Earth very similar to our own, where he worked as a prison guard.\n\nPimli is shown to be cautious and restrained in his approach to his service to the Crimson King. He relies on his humanity and spirituality to guide him in his endeavors. He is portrayed as being a newly devout Catholic. This devotion to Catholicism is apparently triggered by his experiences in [[All-World|End-World]].\n\nPimli was killed by [[Roland Deschain|Roland Deschain's]] ka-tet during the raid on Algul Siento. Before dying, he was able to inflict a mortal gunshot wound on [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]], thus breaking Roland's ka-tet.\n\n==Neutral==\n\n===Gan===\nThe being ''Gan'' is first mentioned by name in ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'', the sixth installment in the series. He is described as speaking \"through the voices of the can-calah, who men call [[angel]]s,\" and as \"denying the [[Crimson King]] and denying [[Eris (mythology)|Discordia]] itself.\" Gan's role in the novels is very much in line with the concept of [[God]]. In the cosmology of Stephen King's multiverse, Gan is that which the High Speech term [[Glossary of The Dark Tower#The Red, the White, and the Black|\"The White\"]] refers to. Gan rose from the Prim (implied as being the darkness behind everything) and created the universes and infinite alternate universes that the Dark Tower (a building that serves as a microcosm of all of the multiple realities of the ''Dark Tower'' series) holds in place.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Alice===\n\nA barmaid in Tull seen in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. She befriended Roland and told him about the story of Nort. Roland knew she would eventually ask Nort about the number Nineteen and knew this was a trap set up by The Man in Black. After she had asked Nort about the number Nineteen, Roland shot her in the head as she wished, as she could not bear what she was told. She was briefly recognised by Jake in ''[[The Waste Lands]]'' in New York.\n \n===Hart Thorin===\n\nMayor of Mejis first seen in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', brother of Coral Thorin and husband of Olive Thorin. Murdered by Roy Depape.\n\n===James Farson===\nFarson's nephew is a young, slim musician. He has short, straight, black hair and dark eyes. He is a high-ranking soldier or henchmen of Farson's Revolutionary Army, and one who met Gabrielle Deschain in their plans for the murder of Steven Deschain. He is always seen near his uncle, not directly in battle.\n\n===Nort===\n\nAppeared in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. Nort dies twice: once prior to Roland's stay in Tull, and once later at Roland's hand. Alice retells the story of Nort's first death\u2014and subsequent resurrection\u2014to Roland. Nort dies in Sheb's bar. He is described as a drunk and a user of devil-grass\u2014one who has graduated from smoking it to chewing it, to Roland's shock and disgust. On the afternoon that he dies, The Man in Black appears and revives him in front of the regulars in the bar. He then hands Alice a note which states that if she speaks the code word \"nineteen\" to Nort, he will tell her of the secrets beyond Death. The note is intended as a trap; Alice eventually falls prey to it and says the word, triggering a town-wide frenzy against Roland in which he kills the entire population. Nort is last seen hanging above Sheb's bar, spread-eagled and crucified with wooden pegs, with a large and purple cloven hoof on his forehead. It is unclear who committed this crime, but it is likely the work of either Sylvia Pittston\u2014who had referenced the cloven hoof in her sermon\u2014or one of her followers, over whom she had a high degree of control.\n\n===Olive Thorin===\n\nWife of Hart Thorin first seen in ''[[Wizard and Glass]]''. Despite being pushed aside by her husband in favour of Susan Delgado, she was kind to Susan and tried to help her escape Mejis. Out of the original meeting between the townspeople and Roland, Cuthbert and Alain, she was the only one who Roland liked. Helped Susan escape from Mejis; however, was killed by Clay Reynolds before Susan was returned by Rhea for the reaping.\n\n===Sheb===\n\nSheb was a piano player first seen in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. He was in Mejis at some point of his life before ending up in Tull. He originally did not recognise Roland until Roland prompts him by mentioning Susan Delgado. He is killed by Roland. He is seen again in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'' in a minor role during Roland's tale from Mejis.\n\n===Sylvia Pittston===\n\nA preacher seen in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' and preaches to the town of Tull about \"The Interloper\" and how the town should cast him down. She implies this to be Roland. She is killed by Roland. Coral Thorin briefly mentions Sylvia Pittston in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'' about how she passed through the town a year prior to events of the story.\n\n===Tim Ross===\n\nAppears in ''[[The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'' as part of Roland's story to Bill. Tim Ross lives with his mother Nell in a forgotten village that fears the annual collection of property taxes by a man named The Covenant Man. Tim recently lost his father, who was said to have been killed by a dragon while in the woods chopping trees. After the death of his father, Nell, no longer able to pay the taxes to keep their home, marries his father's best friend and business partner Bern Kells, who moves in with them. Kells is a mean man, prone to heavy drinking, who begins to abuse both Tim and Nell. One day The Covenant Man comes to collect the taxes, and he secretly tells Tim to meet him later in the woods. During this meeting, The Covenant Man reveals to Tim that it was actually Kells who killed his father, not a dragon, and with help of a scrying bowl shows Kells beating his mother, causing her to go blind. Later, The Covenant Man sends Tim a vision telling him that if Tim again visits The Covenant Man in the woods, he will give Tim magic that will allow his mother to see again. Tim, armed with a gun given to him by his school teacher, journeys into the dangerous woods, and is led into a swamp by the mischievous fairy, Armaneeta. Here, Tim almost becomes victim to a dragon and other mysterious swamp creatures, but he is saved by his gun as well as a group of friendly swamp people, who mistake him for a gunslinger. The swamp people guide him to the far side of the swamp, and equip him with a small mechanical talking device from the 'Old People' that helps guide him on his journey. Eventually, Tim arrives at a Dogan where he finds a caged 'tyger' and befriends the tyger. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket. Returning home, Tim brings sight back to his mother. Tim is attacked by Kells, who had secretly entered the home as Tim tended to his mother, but the boy is saved by his mother, who kills Kells with her late husband's ax.\n\nLater in life, Tim becomes a gunslinger in his own right, known first as Lefty Ross and then as Tim Stoutheart.\n\n===Tyger===\n\nA Tyger seen in ''[[The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'' as part of Roland's story to Bill and implied to be the guardian of the Beam of the Cat. Tim Ross arrives at a Dogan where he finds Tyger, which wears the key to the Dogan around its neck. A starkblast approaches, and Tim, realizing this is likely a trap set for him by The Covenant Man (also known as Randall Flagg and the Man in Black) befriends the tyger. Tim and the tyger ride out the storm under a magical protective blanket. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket.\n\n==Other==\n\n===North Central Positronics===\nNorth Central Positronics appears in multiple works of Stephen King, in the Dark Tower series and related works. It is a huge corporation which manufactures technologically advanced items such as [[robot]]s, [[computer]]s, and weapons. Many of the products are prominent in the [[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]] series, where the few remaining North Central Positronics products still functioning have gone [[insane]], preying upon life and the remnants of [[civilization]]. This is related to the phenomenon affecting much of reality; everything is falling apart. As stated in the books, the world has \"moved on\".\n\nBy the time it is encountered by [[Roland of Gilead|Roland]] and his [[Ka (Dark Tower)|ka-tet]], North Central Positronics is part of the [[Sombra Corporation|Sombra Group]], owned by the [[Crimson King]], the personification of [[evil]] in the world of the Dark Tower. LaMerk Industries and LaMerk Foundry are two other entities which appear to be subsidiaries of the Sombra Group. The Crimson King's stated goal is the destruction of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]/all reality.\n\nAmong NCP's creations in the books are dipolar computers, a number of [[Android (robot)|android]]s and [[cyborg]]s (namely the Guardians of the beams, including [[Shardik (Dark Tower)#Shardik|Shardik]] the Bear and Maturin the Turtle), Stuttering Bill (one of the few robots the Ka-Tet encounter that is not hostile and actually aids them in their quest), Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions), and [[Blaine the Mono]], a highly intelligent and sadistic monorail system that enjoys riddles. In \"The Waste Lands,\" Jake and Gasher, and later Roland, enter the underworld of the city of Lud via an iron manhole which is protected by a cover stamped with the label \"LaMerk Foundry.\"\n\nIn ''The Dark Tower: End-World Almanac'' published by [[Marvel Comics]], one of North Central Positronics' major products is said to be the \"[[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]-class robot\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{DarkTower}}\n{{Characters created by Stephen King}}\n\n[[Category:The Dark Tower characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters|Dark Tower, The]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Dark Tower'' characters}}\n[[The Dark Tower (series)|''The Dark Tower'']] is a series of eight novels written by American author [[Stephen King]], which incorporate multiple genres including fantasy, science fantasy, horror and western. Below are '''''The Dark Tower'' characters''' that come into play as the series progresses.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Protagonists==\n===Ka-tet of the Nineteen and/or Ninety and Nine===\n\n====Roland Deschain====\n{{Main|Roland Deschain}}\nRoland Deschain, son of Steven Deschain, was born in the Barony of Gilead, in In-World. Roland is the last surviving gunslinger, a man whose goal is finding and climbing to the top of the Dark Tower, purported to be the very center of existence, so that he may right the wrongs in his land. This quest is his obsession, monomania and [[geas]] to Roland: In the beginning the success of the quest is more important than the lives of his family and friends. He is a man who lacks imagination, and this is one of the stated reasons for his survival against all odds: he can not imagine anything other than surviving to find the Tower.\n\n====Eddie Dean====\nEdward Cantor \"Eddie\" Dean first appears in ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three|The Drawing of the Three]]'', in which Roland encounters three doors that open into the [[New York City]] of our world in different times. Through these doors, Roland draws companions who will join him on his quest, as the Man In Black foretold. The first to be drawn is Eddie Dean, a [[drug addict]] and a first-time [[cocaine]] [[drug mule|mule]]. Eddie lives with his older brother and fellow junkie Henry, whom Eddie reveres despite the corrupting influence Henry has had upon his life. Roland helps Eddie fight off a gang of mobsters for whom he was transporting the cocaine, but not before Eddie discovers that Henry has died from an overdose of [[heroin]] in the company of the aforementioned mobsters (after which the mobsters decide to chop off Henry's head). It is because of Eddie's heroin addiction that he is termed 'The Prisoner' (the inscription above the door Roland draws Eddie from).\n\nRoland also acquires medicine for his infection during the trip to Eddie's world, but this only temporarily quells the fever.\n\nEddie passes through the door into Roland's world, and faces heroin [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms, but despite his suffering, he also shows an affinity for the way of the gun\u2014and a good deal of what Roland calls 'steel'. Unwillingly at first, Eddie becomes Roland's companion through Mid-World, and he soon falls in love with Susannah, the next member of Roland's [[ka-tet]]. Eddie and Susannah consider themselves husband and wife, although they never formally marry.\n\nIn the final novel, during the attack on Algul Siento, Eddie is shot and killed by Pimli Prentiss, the master of the establishment.\n\nRoland also notes that Eddie's character strongly resembles that of Cuthbert, a gunslinger of Roland's past, and one of Roland's greatest friends. The character of Cuthbert is mentioned in Browning's poem and is described most fully in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass]]'', although he is first mentioned in ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]''.\n\n====Susannah Dean====\nAlso hailing from New York City, Susannah is a black woman (although as a woman of 1964, she prefers the term \"[[Negro]]\" over the term considered appropriate in Eddie's time, \"[[Black people|Black]]\") with two major afflictions: her legs below the knees were severed in a subway accident, and a childhood head injury left her with [[dissociative identity disorder|dual personalities]], which Eddie incorrectly labels [[schizophrenia]]. She is \"The Lady of Shadows\", the second companion predicted by Walter to be drawn into Roland's world via the mysterious doors.\n\nInitially, her dominant personality is that of Odetta Susannah Holmes, a well-mannered but priggish woman active in the [[civil rights]] movement. At times, however, she is taken over by Detta Susannah Walker\u2014murderously psychotic, incredibly crafty, completely unbreakable\u2014whom neither Eddie nor Roland can control. Neither Odetta nor Detta are aware of the existence of the other, and [[Confabulation|confabulate]] memories for the periods when they are not the dominant personality. Roland manages to resolve these personalities by forcing Detta to look through the third door while he himself looks out of it, forcing Detta and Odetta to see themselves for what they really are, and almost kill each other upon realising their presence. However, Odetta chooses to embrace Detta, and the personalities are integrated into a single, far more balanced individual, known as Susannah Dean, Eddie's wife, although they were never formally married. Susannah has access to the memories and personalities of both Holmes and Walker, and can call upon their skills and temperaments at will.\n\nDuring the drawing of Jake, she submits to sex with the demon of the doorway in order to distract it and afterwards, she becomes pregnant. Susannah shares the experience of her pregnancy with a demon-turned-mortal named Mia, resulting in Susannah housing yet another personality in her mind. Mia takes over Susannah's body (and melds with it, giving her legs for a short while) and runs in it to yet another ''when'' of New York, this one circa 1999, to give birth to the demon child.\n\nSusannah is the last member of Roland's ''ka-tet'' to leave him (and the only one to survive in a Keystone world), having been given the chance to return to another form of Eddie and Jake in a parallel world.\n\n====Jake Chambers====\nJake Chambers is an eleven-year-old boy from the New York of 1977, and is considered by Roland to be his \"true son\". Jake's given name is John, but he prefers to be known by Jake, and is called \"'Bama\" by his housekeeper, who is far closer to him than his parents. In his home world, he dies at the hands of Jack Mort (who Jake initially believes is [[Randall Flagg|Walter]]) and ends up in Roland's world as a result. The gunslinger and the boy travel together in pursuit of the Man in Black, developing a strong bond along the way. However, in order to reach the Man in Black, Roland lets Jake fall to his death.\n\nThe child Roland allowed to die reappears in Roland's mind in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]'' resulting in a [[paradox]]. Since Roland (in ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three|The Drawing of the Three]]'') prevented Mort from shoving Jake into traffic, he never died, therefore he never appeared in Mid-World and was never left to die under the mountains. Jake and Roland, however, can remember both timelines, and the knowledge is slowly driving them insane.\n\nIn the first half of ''The Waste Lands'', Roland's ka-tet figure out a way to draw Jake into Mid-world, where he belongs (an action which finishes the real Drawing of the Three, Jack Mort never having been intended to join the ka-tet). Eddie is driven to whittle a key out of wood as they approach a Speaking Ring, where Eddie draws another door into the ground, this one guarded by an invisible demon. Susannah distracts the demon by allowing it to copulate with her, while Eddie perfects the key and uses it to open the door. On the other side, Jake has been led by the younger version of Eddie who lived in that ''when'' to a [[haunted house]] (indeed, Eddie has vague memories of the encounter himself), filled with evil spirits and a horrendous gate-keeper. Jake, with some timely assistance from Roland, fights through them to reach the door. Once the boy is in Mid-World again, Roland's and Jake's memories are merged and their descent into insanity abated.\n\nOn the journey, Jake befriends a billy-bumbler who he calls Oy, who provides comfort for the boy on his quest. While crossing the desolate city of Lud, Jake is kidnapped by a deranged resident of the city. He allows himself to be taken in exchange for the rest of the group's safe passage, and Roland promises to come for Jake, despite having to abandon him temporarily. Despite the danger it poses, he rescues Jake with the help of Oy, reaffirming the father-son bond that has grown between them. Like Eddie and Susannah, Jake shows amazing aptitude to the way of a gunslinger.\n\nJake is the second member of the ka-tet to die, when he sacrifices himself to save Stephen King (as a character in the series) from certain death by putting himself between King and the van meant to take his life. By the end of the tale Jake has died a total of three times. An alternate version of Jake is encountered later by Susannah Dean; in this world, he and Eddie are brothers, with the last name Toren.\n\nRoland also notes that Jake strongly resembles Alain, another gunslinger, in his stable, reserved personality and talent with a [[psychic]] skill referred to as \"the touch.\" Alain is described mostly by his time with Roland as a teen in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''.\n\n====Oy====\nOy is a \"billy-bumbler,\" a strange creature found in [[Roland Deschain]]'s world. King describes Oy in the \"Argument\", or foreword, of the fourth book, ''[[Wizard and Glass]]''\u2014\"Bumblers, which look like a combination of badger, raccoon, and dog, have a limited speaking ability\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=XIII }}</ref> Elsewhere, bumblers are described as \"a combination raccoon and woodchuck, with a little dachshund thrown in.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 221] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 }}</ref> At one point, Eddie calls Oy \"a fucked-up weasel\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=636 }}</ref> Oy's voice is described as \"low and deep, almost a bark; the voice of an English footballer with a bad cold in his throat.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 221] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/221 }}</ref>\n\nRegarding Oy's appearance, by far the most frequently described feature throughout the series is his large, \"bright\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=60 }}</ref> almost glowing, \"intelligent, gold-ringed eyes\",<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=652 }}</ref> though King also frequently refers to the creature's \"disproportionately long,<ref>{{cite book |title=Wizard and Glass |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27917-8 |page=16 }}</ref>\" \"surprisingly graceful neck\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 222] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 }}</ref> The creature has \"black- and grey-striped fur<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/220 220] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/220 }}</ref>\" and a \"furry corkscrew tail\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wastelands |last=King |first=Stephen |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26740-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 222] |url=https://archive.org/details/wastelands00king_0/page/222 }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of their meeting, Roland concedes that Oy may quite possibly be meant as another member of their ka-tet. Later, in the 6th book, this is confirmed when the [[Tet Corporation]] forms as the association of \"Deschain, Dean, Dean, Chambers, and Oy.\"\n\nOy develops emotions and even a sense of humanity beyond that of his ability to replicate some words that the others speak. Oy is often referred as the smartest bumbler that characters have seen since the world had moved on. Oy provides a much-needed shelter from the harsh nature of the quest for Jake, often playing with him or providing moments of lightheartedness to the ka-tet. His deep loyalty to his friend saves Jake's life several times, and he remains part of Roland's ka-tet even after the boy dies, as a final request from Jake.\n\nOy is killed in the last Dark Tower book. He saves Roland's life by attacking Mordred, who came to kill Roland in his sleep. Mordred snaps Oy's back and impales him on a tree limb while the bumbler is defending his friend, but Oy finds enough strength to lick Roland's hand one time before he dies. Stephen King hints that Oy will be found in the same universe that Susannah travels to and will be in some form of a dog with \"odd, gold-ringed eyes and a bark that eerily resembles human speech.\"\n\n===Roland's original Ka-tet===\n====Cuthbert Allgood====\nCuthbert is Roland Deschain's childhood best friend, and a member of his original ka-tet. Roland and Cuthbert are described as having been playing together since they were toddlers. Cuthbert, often called Bert, is first featured in The Gunslinger, but he does not play a major role in the series until Wizard and Glass, the fourth volume in the series.\nCuthbert is characterized by his outwardly flippant, care-free view of the world. He constantly makes jokes, often testing the nerves of his companions. He is notably skilled with a sling-shot: it is said that he could 'take a bird on the wing at 50 yards' with it. This is a skill that comes in handy on many occasions in Mejias when the boys cannot openly carry their guns.\nCuthbert is quick-witted and sometimes has a way with words\u2014his proclivity for words can be noticed as he often stops to repeat and muse over phrases he finds to be nice and 'round'.\nPhysically, Cuthbert is described as being trim and tall with shoulder-length dark hair and dark eyes.\nDuring the battle of Jericho Hill, Cuthbert is shot through the eye by an arrow fired by Randall Flagg.\nIn Song of Susannah, Eddie Dean is revealed to be a reincarnation, or at least a \"twinner\" of Cuthbert Allgood.\n\n====Alain Johns====\nAlain is one of Roland's original [[ka-tet]], and along with the gunslinger and Cuthbert is evacuated to Mejias in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard, and Glass]]'' for safety, due to the ongoing war against [[John Farson]]. Alain is strong in the 'touch', which is the mid-world term for a combination of telepathy, precognition, and hypersensitivity to the guiding hand of Ka.\n\nAlain is described as being stout with blond hair. He is calm, reserved and often plays the role of level-headed mediator between ever pragmatic Roland and ostensibly care-free Cuthbert\u2014particularly when Susan Delgado is seen to be interfering with Roland's decision making.\n\nAfter Mejias, Alain joined Roland, Cuthbert, and Jamie on their quest for the Dark Tower.\n\nShortly before the battle of Jericho Hill, the last stand by the gunslingers of Gilead against Farson's men, Alain was accidentally killed by Roland and Cuthbert, who mistook him for an assassin in the night.\n\n====Jamie De Curry====\nJamie De Curry was a member of Roland Deschain's original ka-tet. He grew up and trained with Roland under Cort and Vannay in Gilead. He was the first to discover Roland's plan to attempt to finish his training (by fighting Cort, their veteran teacher) at the unprecedented age of 14. He is characterized by a birthmark on his face, leading some in Gilead to refer to him as \"Jamie of the marked face.\" He was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Jericho Hill while pushing Roland from the line of fire. It's stated by Roland that as a child he excelled in archery\u2014the use of a bow and 'bah' (crossbow)\u2014far more so than Roland himself, although by the time of the Battle of Jericho Hill he is a Gunslinger, like the rest of Roland's ka-tet.\n\nJamie figures prominently in the novel ''[[The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'', traveling with Roland to investigate rumors of a shape-changing \"skin-man\" that is attacking a frontier town. In this novel, his birthmark is described as being a deep red one on his hand, making it appear as if it has been dipped in blood, and he has the nickname \"Jamie Red-Hand.\"\n\n====Thomas Whitman====\nNot much is known about Thomas Whitman. He is only briefly mentioned in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' as one of Roland Deschain's childhood friends who studied under Cort. He is shown in several installments of the Gunslinger comics. He is shown to have a lean build with short, black hair. In the Battle of Jericho Hill, he and several other Gunslingers are killed by a flamethrower.\n\n===Allies of the Ka-tet===\n====Susan Delgado====\nSusan Delgado appears in ''Wizard and Glass'', the fourth book of the Dark Tower series. She is a resident of Hambry, in the Barony of Mejis, where the 14-year-old Roland and his ''ka-tet'' have been sent for their own safety. Susan's father was purportedly killed in a horseback riding accident, which Susan later learned was a murder premeditated by the town's leadership. Shortly before Roland's arrival Susan has been cajoled by her aunt Cordelia into becoming a concubine, or \"gilly\", for Mejis' mayor, Hart Thorin. Although Susan is to be paid for her services, she is a recognized consort and any heir she bears to the heretofore-childless Thorin will be considered legitimate. Before consummating her relationship with Thorin, however, she falls in love with Roland and becomes involved in the young gunslinger's plans to prevent [[John Farson]] from using an oilfield near Hambry to supply his troops with crude oil. When Roland and his friends are framed for Thorin's murder and arrested, she breaks them out of jail and helps them escape Hambry. Before she can flee, however, she is captured, brought back to town, and publicly burned at the stake as an alleged accomplice in the murder. At the time, she is already pregnant with Roland's first child. Roland is devastated by her death\u2014not just because of his love for her\u2014but because, when confronted with the choice of returning for her or setting out for the Dark Tower and thus saving all of creation, he chose the Tower, thus condemning her to death.\n\nRoland believes that Susan Delgado was the only ''true'' love of his life.\n\n====Ted Brautigan====\nTed Stevens Brautigan was introduced in the Stephen King novella \"Low Men in Yellow Coats\" from ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]''. He is a powerful \"Breaker\", a psychic, whose extraordinary powers as a facilitator are sought by the Crimson King so he can hasten the destruction of the beams and Dark Tower. Ted arrives in the [[Devar-Toi]], the prison camp where the Breakers are held, in 1955, and with help from Roland's old friend from Mejis, Sheemie Ruiz, soon escapes the Devar-Toi and enters the [[Connecticut]] of 1960, which is when the story of \"Low Men in Yellow Coats\" takes place. After his adventure in Connecticut, the low men capture and smuggle him back to the Devar-Toi via the Dixie Pig and Thunderclap Station. Ted meets Roland and his ka-tet in the final novel of the series, and he, Dinky Earnshaw, and the newly revealed psychic Sheemie assist the ka-tet in the attack on the Devar-Toi and ultimately succeed in obliterating the low men and the taheen. After Roland, Jake, and Oy travel to the Maine of 1999 to prevent [[#Stephen King|Stephen King]] from dying, Ted and his friends escort Susannah Dean to Fedic Station, and Ted, along with a handful of the other Breakers depart for the Callas, where they hope to first find redemption from the Calla folken and then return to America via the Doorway Cave.\n\n====Sheemie Ruiz====\nSheemie, introduced in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', was a mildly [[Mental retardation|mentally handicapped]] tavern boy at a saloon in Hambry. Sheemie assisted Roland and his first ka-tet in preventing the followers of [[John Farson]], and more specifically, the Crimson King, from reviving the Great Old Ones' war machines, later following the group back to Gilead. Sheemie joined Roland's ka-tet briefly and helped the gunslingers ward off the Crimson King's followers until he and his mule Capi mysteriously disappeared. However, while Roland assumes Sheemie is dead, he is not; he had been captured by the low men and taken to the Devar-Toi, the Breaker prison, because of his telepathic abilities, which remained unknown to Roland's ka-tet. He reappears in the series' final novel and assists the new ka-tet in defeating the low men and the taheen. However, during the battle, he steps on a piece of glass, causing an infection (accelerated by the \"poison air\" around Thunderclap). While escorting Susannah to Fedic on the train, he dies of blood poisoning. Although Susannah never learns this, she is indirectly responsible for his death, as it is her bullet that breaks the glass out of his window, causing it to be there for him to step on.\n\n====Dinky Earnshaw====\nRichard \"Dinky\" Earnshaw is the psychic assassin from Stephen King's short story \"[[Everything's Eventual (short story)|Everything's Eventual]].\" He was hired by a man named Mr. Sharpton who was the head of a [[List of The Dark Tower characters#North Central Positronics|North Central Positronics]] subsidiary. However, when Dinky discovered what Sharpton was truly using him for, he killed Sharpton. Unfortunately, the low men captured him and transported him to the Devar-Toi, where he later met Ted Brautigan and Sheemie Ruiz. The three joined forces with Roland and his ka-tet in the final novel of the series and they helped to defeat the Devar-Toi's guards.\n\n====Pere Donald Callahan====\n{{Main|Father Callahan}}\nDonald Frank Callahan is the \"damned\" priest who first appeared in the novel ''[['Salem's Lot]]''. He makes his first appearance in the Dark Tower series in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'', although his involvement in the series was hinted at in the afterword to ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''. After being marked by the vampire [[Kurt Barlow]], and therefore forced out of his church, Father Callahan spends time volunteering in a homeless shelter. Callahan made it a goal to get even with the vampires for what they did to him and his friend, who contracted [[HIV]] after being bitten by a vampire. He is aided in this by his ability to spot the vampires; since Jerusalem's Lot (and the forced ingestion of some of the vampire Barlow's blood) he has been able to recognize vampires on sight. Like Jake Chambers, Callahan enters Mid-World after dying in his own world, although in Callahan's case the death is his own doing; he jumps from a window to escape agents of the Crimson King, then arrives at the Way Station from ''The Gunslinger'', shortly after Jake & Roland left it. He becomes a partial member of the ka-tet, assisting the ka-tet in the Battle against the Wolves and Susannah's rescue mission from 1999 New York, and sacrificing himself so that Jake may live in the final stand in ''The Dark Tower VII'' against the can-toi (low men) and vampires. For the second time, Callahan kills himself before allowing himself to fall at the hands of the vampires.\n\n====Patrick Danville====\nPatrick appears in ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]'' as a promising child artist, then again at the end of the Dark Tower series as a young adult artist with enough talent to shape the real world as he sees fit. As a young boy, he was prophesied to save two men in the future. He drew pictures of Roland and the roses as well. In the Dark Tower series, he was kept imprisoned for an unknown amount of time by the psychic vampire Dandelo and was rescued by Susannah and Roland. Patrick draws a door that allows Susannah to enter a parallel world, and later draws and erases a picture of the Crimson King, causing him to disappear from the Tower so that Roland can safely enter it.\n\n====Aunt Talitha Unwin====\n\"Aunt\" Talitha Unwin is a resident of River Crossing, near the city of Lud. When Roland Deschain came to River Crossing, she was 105 years old.\nShe and the people of River Crossing provided food and shelter for the ka-tet while they were on their way to Lud. Talitha gave her cross to Roland to lay at the base of the Dark Tower. It was given to John Cullum to act as a sigul and was later returned to Roland by Moses Carver.\n\nWhen Roland came to the Dark Tower, Talitha Unwin was one of the names that he called out and he remembered to place her cross at its base.\n\n====Cortland \"Cort\" Andrus====\nTeacher of Roland's original ka-tet. Roland earned his guns by defeating him with the hawk David, who was mortally wounded in that battle. After Roland's challenge, Cort laid in his cabin for a week in a coma, being tended by two nurses. Cort was often rough handed with his students, using physical punishment and denial of food to punish mistakes. He also fancied calling the prospective gunslingers \"maggots\". According to Roland, he is murdered soon after Roland's class graduates. He acts as a sort of a spiritual guide to Roland throughout the series, his voice and teachings popping up in the Gunslinger's mind every so often as Roland needs to reflect upon his training.\n\n====Abel Vannay====\nAlso known as \"Vannay the Wise\", he was the other primary tutor of Roland's ka-tet and of apprentice gunslingers. Known mostly for his wisdom and forbearance, Vannay's analytical method of instruction and pacifistic nature serve as strong counterpoints to the ruthless application of force and cynical thought process exercised by Cort. It is mentioned that he walks with the assistance of a black ironwood cane. His only known relative was his son Wallace, who played with Roland as a toddler; however, he died very young of an illness. Vannay would become one of the many victims to fall prey to the forces of [[John Farson]] in the battle for [[Gilead]].\n\n====Stephen King====\n{{See also|Stephen King}}\nStephen King (as a fictionalized character) appears in the final two Dark Tower books. Roland and his ka-tet learn of his existence when Roland comes across a copy of ''[[Salem's Lot]]'', after first meeting Father Callahan in the fifth book ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''. Roland and Eddie later confront King in his Maine home at a time when he has written ''<nowiki/>'Salem's Lot'' and ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' but no further Dark Tower books. Roland hypnotizes King and it is revealed that the author did not in fact \"create\" the characters of Father Callahan, or Roland, or any others involved with the Dark Tower, but Stephen King is in this reality a channel (another servant of the Beam / ka / Gan) that records their ongoing quest. It is also revealed that at a very young age, the Crimson King attempted to claim Stephen King as one of his own. King fears death and retaliation from the Crimson King if he continues to write Roland's tale but the Gunslinger's hypnosis encourages him to continue. The eventual attempt on King's life that would end his chronicling of Roland's quest comes in the form of his [[Stephen King#Car accident and thoughts of retirement|1999 automobile incident]].\n\nMany elements of Stephen King's real life are presented through his character (such as his 1999 accident) but are further fictionalized; King notes in the afterword to ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]'' that he took particular liberties with the geography of Maine to obscure the real-life location of his home and preserve what privacy he still has. Although he does not appear as a character until ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'', he is alluded to as early as ''[[The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three|The Drawing of the Three]]'' when Eddie recalls having seen ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' in movie theaters.\n\n====Stuttering Bill====\nStuttering Bill is a robot (full name '''William D-746541-M Maintenance Robot''' with many other functions) appearing in ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''. He plowed Tower Road all the way up to the edge of the white lands, where the snow ended and the roses began. He gave Roland, Susannah and Patrick a ride on his snowplow for many miles, taking them closer to the Dark Tower.\n\nStuttering Bill was also the nickname of [[Bill Denbrough (character)|William Denbrough]], one of the central characters in King's novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]''.\n\n====Calvin Tower====\nCalvin Tower is the lease holder of the Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind bookstore in the series. He makes his first appearance in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]'', where he sells Jake two books which later prove vital to the Ka-tet's survival of their encounter with Blaine the Mono. In later volumes, it is revealed that Tower owns the lot containing the rose, and is being pressured by mobsters to sell the property to the Sombra Corporation. Eddie saves Tower from a beating, and convinces Tower to sell the land to the ka-tet in the guise of the \"Tet Corporation\". Tower is an extremely reluctant recruit to the Ka-tet's cause, and his selfishness, obsessive addiction to acquiring rare books nearly derail the Ka-tet's efforts on several occasions. His eventual\u2014and reluctant\u2014decision to do the right thing comes largely thanks to the influence of his much more selfless, heroic friend, Aaron Deepneau. In the end, he sells the lot to Tet Corporation, and serves on the board for many years. With Deepneau, he saves Father Callahan from knife-wielding thugs. Tower dies of a heart attack in 1990.\n\n====Aaron Deepneau====\nAaron Deepneau is Calvin Tower's best\u2014and only\u2014friend. He serves as Tower's conscience, and steadily leads his friend to the gunslinger's cause. He later joins the board of Tet Corporation, and proves to be one of the rose's most ardent defenders. His grand-niece Nancy, a gunslinger in her own right, works for the Tet Corporation. Deepneau dies of cancer in 1992.\n\n====John Cullum====\nMet Roland and Eddie during the ambush in Stoneham, 1977. He leads the pair to safety, ferries them to his home, and provides a vehicle for them to use. He also becomes a member of Tet Corp's board and tireless champion of the rose, and dies for the cause, assassinated by Sombra/NCP in 1989.\n\n====Maturin====\nThe Guardians of the Beams keep watch over either end of the six beams that support The Dark Tower. Of the twelve Guardians the ones that are mentioned are Turtle, Bear, Fish, Wolf, Elephant, Rat, Bat, Lion, Horse, and Eagle; Maturin, the Turtle (also a character in ''It''), is considered the most powerful, or significant, of these. Throughout the series the reader repeatedly comes across a simple, nursery-rhyme style poem about Maturin:\n\n<blockquote><poem>See the TURTLE of enormous girth!\nOn his shell he holds the Earth,\nHis thought is slow but always kind;\nHe holds us all within his mind.\n\nOn his back the truth is carried,\nAnd there are love and duty married.\nHe loves the earth and loves the sea,\nAnd even loves a child like me.</poem></blockquote>\n\nMaturin guards the same beam as Shardik from the opposite end. Whereas Shardik runs amok in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]'', nearly killing Eddie before it can be destroyed, Maturin is a totally benevolent (and incredibly powerful) presence in the story, helping the ka-tet at several points along their journey.\n\nIn ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]'', a small ivory [[scrimshaw]] sculpture of Maturin comes into the ka-tet's possession, and with it, Susannah/Mia hypnotizes a stranger, forcing him to get Susannah/Mia a hotel room. Susannah leaves the turtle where Jake will find it, enabling him (and, through his own martyrdom, Pere Callahan) to track Susannah and escape the low men, taheen, and vampires in the Dixie Pig. The sculpture essentially holds any human (or can-toi) totally enrapt and compliant upon seeing it in the hands of its wielder. The carving is said to have a question-mark shaped scratch on its shell.\n\nAlso in books VI and VII, multiple characters stumble upon a small park near #2 Hammarskjold Plaza containing a fountain beside a bronze sculpture of a turtle. The park\u2014and the sculpture\u2014actually exist, although King places the park across the street from #2 Hammarskjold Plaza: In fact, the turtle is in a larger park directly alongside the building, part of the Katharine Hepburn Memorial Garden. The sculpture is a nod to the neighborhood's centuries-old nickname, Turtle Bay.[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Turtle_fountain_-_Hammarskjold_Plaza_NYC.jpg]\n\nBoth Turtle Bay and Maturin the turtle appear in King's earlier novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', serving much the same benevolent supernatural guardian role.\n\nThe name Maturin itself is a reference to [[Stephen Maturin]], a naturalist from the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]] of novels who discovers a new species of tortoise.\n\n====Moses Carver====\nOdetta/Susannah's godfather and guardian, retired president of the Tet Corporation, and protector of the rose. When he finally appears in ''The Dark Tower'', he is 100 years old, with a fiery, mischievous, and extremely likable character. He has little gold framed glasses, a bad case of rheumatism, and a stooped posture; upon seeing him, Roland estimates that if he could stand straight, the two would be the same height (roughly 6'3\"). He is the last living founder of the corporation, and his daughter Marian serves as its president since his retirement in 1997.\n\n====Irene Tassenbaum====\nIrene is a middle-aged housewife from Staten Island, somewhat neglected by her wealthy husband, who meets Roland, Jake, and Oy in Stoneham, Maine of the Keystone World in the year 1999. She volunteers to drive the gunslinger's party to Lovell, where they narrowly manage to save Stephen King's life, with Jake sacrificing his own life in the process. Tassenbaum then drives Roland and Oy to New York (making love with Roland along the way), where the gunslinger and the bumbler meet with the board of Tet Corp. before returning to Mid-World. Irene promises Roland that she will plant a rose at Jake's grave.\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===John Farson===\nFarson, a.k.a. the Good Man, was a former thief, murderer, and harrier in the lands west of Gilead in Roland's youth, later becoming a general of rebellious people from the lesser classes of Mid-World. Followers, at his command, occupied Downland Baronies such as the Barony of Cressia, and after allying with the blue-faced barbarians of Grissom, they finally overwhelmed Gilead and the gunslingers. After the fall of Gilead and Farson's triumph, Roland and his old ka-tet fought for nine years against the remainder of Farson's forces, eventually leading to the battle of Jericho Hill. Farson sends his Generals Grissom and Walter O\u00b4Dim with the last two thousand soldiers and mutants against Roland, who was the only survivor.\nFarson is tall and slim, he has short, straight, black hair, brown eyes and wears black armor. He wears a terrible fright mask around his men.\n\nIn ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', a then-teenage Roland and his ''ka-tet'' uncover and stop a plot by Farson to use crude oil from fields in the Barony of Mejis to fuel his rebellion. Farson has recruited most of the Barony's elite to his cause. Roland later reflects that his actions only delayed the eventual fall of Gilead.\n\n===Randall Flagg===\n{{Main|Randall Flagg}}\n<!-- Please keep this brief, there is a main article for a reason... --->The Man in Black, and a character with numerous aliases, including: the Ageless Stranger, the Walking Dude, Walter O'Dim, Marten Broadcloak, Richard Faninn, Rudin Filaro, Legion, Covenant Man, and his given name, Walter Padick, son of Sam; he appears in many books of Stephen King, most notably in ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' and in ''[[The Stand]]'', always as a nearly demonic sorcerer. He is the [[Crimson King]]'s chief agent.\n\n===The Crimson King===\n{{Main|Crimson King}}\n<!-- Please keep this brief, there is a main article for a reason... --->\nThe ultimate in evil, this mysterious figure wishes to conquer the Dark Tower and raze it to the ground. Since this will destroy the entire multiverse, the Crimson King is naturally cast as the villain in The Dark Tower books. He is also known as Ram Aballah, and once ruled from his castle in End-World, but now is imprisoned on a balcony on the Dark Tower, to which he ran while in a fit of madness. He believes that when the Tower falls, he will rule the Todash darkness that was once the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. He is the one whom Walter/Flagg serves, whom the low men and taheen serve, and he has opposed Roland of Gilead from the beginning. The Crimson King is known by a number of names, including Los' the Red, Ram Aballah, The Aballah, The Kingfish, The Red King, The Lord of Spiders, and The Lord of Discordia. He also appears in [[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]] as a higher being trying to murder Patrick Danville as a child.\n\nThe Crimson King is also named in the Stephen King/Peter Straub novel [[Black House (novel)|Black House]], the sequel to [[The Talisman (King and Straub novel)|The Talisman]].\n\n===Jack Mort===\nJack Mort (whose name means \"Death\" in French) is a fictional character who makes a brief appearance in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'', and a more detailed appearance in ''[[The Drawing of the Three]]''. The third door that Roland encounters on the beach leads to Mort and New York in the mid-1970s. Roland finds himself inside the mind of \"The Pusher\", a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] named Jack Mort, whose [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] acts of random violence have shaped the lives of Roland's companions. Mort, an accountant, thrives on being a meticulous planner when it comes to murder. This, and his style of execution, leads him to be an anonymous and therefore very effective killer. For example, Mort will drop bricks (and presumably other heavy items) on people's heads from tall places (what he calls \"depth charging\"), will push people in front of cars, and will also push people in front of subway trains. His methods allow a complete lack of direct confrontation, and thus allow him to continue his secret life quietly and with deadly effectiveness. He acts as a linking point between Susannah (both Odetta and Detta), Jake, and ultimately Roland. When Odetta was five, Mort dropped a brick on her head (which led to the emergence of her [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]); he also pushed Odetta in front of a subway car when she was a teenager (neither knowing nor caring that she was a previous victim of his cruelty). On the day Roland enters him, he is planning to shove a young boy (who turns out to be Jake Chambers) into traffic. Unwilling to let Jake die once again through his inaction, Roland takes control of Mort's body and stops him. This death was the means that forced Jake into Roland's world the first time; when Roland prevented it, it had caused a [[time paradox]], though it was resolved later, or rather, undermined, when Jake entered into Roland's world again, but through a door. Later, Roland purposefully forces Jack Mort to throw himself burning in front of a subway train, while telling him that he deserves a far worse fate. In the midst of this struggle, Roland manages to trick Detta into looking through the door, which forces both Odetta and Detta to acknowledge their dual personalities and the cause of them. Mort is described as tall, thin, and having blonde hair in ''The Drawing of the Three'', yet is said by Roland to have had dark hair when mentioned in ''[[The Waste Lands]]''.\n\n===Blaine the Mono===\nBlaine the Mono is a demented monorail train appearing in ''[[The Waste Lands]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''. Originally serving as public transit in the city of Lud with his partner Patricia, another monorail with female characteristics, he slowly went insane after the world went into decline and the despondent female monorail committed suicide. Roland and his ka-tet have to ride this psychopathic train in order to travel safely from Lud to [[Topeka]] so they can continue their journey toward the Dark Tower. The train seems to be connected to the children's book found by Jake, Charlie the Choo-Choo. Before Blaine lets Roland and his ka-tet on board, he kills every single living thing in the city of Lud with poison gas.\n\nBlaine reveals to the ka-tet that he plans to derail in Topeka, destroying himself and killing them, but accepts Roland's challenge to a riddle contest for a chance at the survival of the ka-tet. If Blaine cannot answer every riddle put to him by the ka-tet, he will let them depart safely once they reach Topeka. It becomes clear that Blaine has a huge library of riddles from many different levels of the tower at his disposal, and programs to decipher plays on words or hidden clues, so the game seems doomed. Eddie eventually stumps Blaine with unsolvable \"riddles\" that are actually stupid jokes sometimes told by humans. This forces Blaine to try to \"lower\" his intelligence to levels necessary to answer, which ends up driving him completely insane and causes his computer to crash. Eddie then proceeds to shoot Blaine's main computer, causing a crash that destroys Blaine but leaves the ka-tet with only minor injuries.\n\n===Shardik===\n'''Shardik''' is a character encountered by [[Roland of Gilead|Roland]] and his [[Ka (Dark Tower)|ka-tet]] in the novel ''[[The Waste Lands]]''.\n\nShardik, while appearing to be a massive [[bear]], is actually a mechanical construct of [[List of The Dark Tower characters#North Central Positronics|North Central Positronics]]. A [[cyborg]], Shardik was built by North Central Positronics to serve as one of the twelve Guardians of the Beams. At the time that he is encountered by Roland, he is several thousand years old, malfunctioning, slowly dying, and infested with parasites (a reference to [[Richard Adams]]'s novel ''[[Shardik]]''). Driven insane by his illness, he attacks Roland and his ka-tet, and they are forced to kill him.\n\nThe Guardians of the Beams keep watch over either end of the six beams that support The Dark Tower. Of the twelve Guardians the ones that are mentioned are Turtle, Bear, Fish, Wolf, Elephant, Rat, Bat, Lion, Horse, and Eagle; Maturin, the Turtle (also a character in ''[[It (novel)|It]]''), is considered the most powerful, or significant, of these. By the time Roland was growing up, the Guardians had reached a near-mythic status, and he wasn't sure whether they even existed before running into Shardik.\n\nThe original Guardians, like so many other elements of Roland's world, may have been [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] entities that were replaced by North Central Positronic's technological constructs. The death of Shardik represents another failure of technology and is one more step in the dismantling of not only Roland's world, but the entire [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of existence.\n\n''[[Shardik]]'' is also a novel by [[Richard Adams]]; King took the name from this book, something some members of Roland's ka-tet recognize: Susannah realizes the source of the name (although the book was published a decade after the year she was drawn from), while Eddie mentions that he thinks of rabbits when he hears the name Shardik\u2014a reference to ''[[Watership Down]]'', another of Adams' books. Adams' Shardik, like King's, is a giant bear.\n\n===Rhea===\nA decrepit old witch, Rhea Dubativo, also known as Rhea of the C\u00f6os, was the one responsible for the death of Roland's true love, Susan Delgado. She owned a 6 legged mutant cat called Musty and a venomous snake called Ermot. She was entrusted with the pink Wizard's Glass (known as Merlin's Grapefruit), which slowly drained her and drove her insane, similar to the deterioration of [[Gollum|Smeagol/Gollum]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Readers never find out what happens to her; although Roland implies that he killed her, nothing more is elaborated upon beyond that. She is seen in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''; however, is mentioned in ''[[The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger|The Gunslinger]]'' prior to her appearance in the series.\n\n===Eldred Jonas===\nThe main antagonist of ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', Eldred is a failed gunslinger now in service to the Crimson King. He leads a gang called the Big Coffin Hunters. Eldred, though in charge of the Red's operations in Mejis, is answerable to George Latigo (one of John Farson's chief lieutenants) and [[Randall Flagg]] (at this time known as Walter), Farson's personal wizard. Briefly mentioned by Sheb in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''.\n\n===Roy Depape===\nArguably the shortest-tempered of the Big Coffin Hunters, Roy Depape's hot-headedness is one of the major catalysts for events in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]''; through threatening Sheemie Ruiz following a mishap in the local tavern, Roy sets off a multi-layered [[Mexican standoff]] between [[Roland Deschain|Roland's]] original ka-tet and the Big Coffin Hunters. Though the situation is initially resolved with diplomacy, the event reveals to Jonas the true nature of Roland and his friends (who were hiding incognito in Mejis under aliases) and blows their cover. When the Big Coffin Hunters frame the young Gunslingers for murder he kills mayor Hart Thorin and plants the rook's skull that ties Cuthbert and by extension Roland and Alain to the crime. He was killed by Roland when the three young gunslingers attacked Eldred and his thirty men, who were riding to meet George Latigo.\n\n===Clay Reynolds===\nClay Reynolds is Eldred Jonas' right-hand man and the quietest of the Big Coffin Hunters. He is described as red-haired and especially handsome, and has a reputation as a ladies' man. His most notable accessory (besides his pistol) is a long red cloak. When the Hunters are framing Roland and his friends he volunteers to kill Kimba Rimer with a long dagger he bought for the occasion, in revenge for a comment Rimer made about his cloak. During the ensuing confusion that transpires near the end of ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', Clay escapes from Mejis with Coral Thorin, and the two become a bandit couple. King first cites Reynolds as having red hair, then changes it to dark (brown/black), then references Depape as being \"be-spectacled and red-haired\" several times. Roland mentions that both Reynolds and Coral Thorin were killed in a failed robbery several years after the events of Mejis. In the comic series ''[[The Dark Tower: The Long Road Home]]'', Reynolds is seen leading a possee of Mejis citizens in pursuit of Roland's Ka-tet, which they break off when Cuthbert Allgood cuts a rope bridge over a wild river. In the one shot issue ''[[The Dark Tower: The Sorcerer]]'', Reynolds is seen being whipped by John Farson for losing Maerlyn's Grapefruit while Coral Thorin waits outside Farson's tent.\n\n===Coral Thorin===\nCoral is the traitorous sister of Mejis' mayor, Hart Thorin. Mature and slender, she catches the eye of both Eldred Jonas and Clay Reynolds. Crafty and intelligent, Coral is able to ascertain that Jonas is indeed working for John Farson and, not wanting to be on the losing side, conspires with and aids Jonas in his dealing in Mejis. The two enter into a sexual relationship, but following Jonas' death Coral becomes the lover and cohort of Clay Reynolds.\n\n===Cordelia Delgado===\nCordelia Delgado was Susan Delgado's aunt, who sold her to Mayor Thorin as a \"gilly\". She has no problem selling Susan for money. Cordelia has a short temper and has fits where she becomes enraged and screams at Susan. When Cordelia learns that Susan has lost her virginity to Roland and not Hart Thorin, she becomes enraged and slowly loses her mind. Towards the end of the book, she has gone completely insane and joins Rhea in killing Susan. Cordelia is the first person to light the pyre that sets Susan on fire; Rhea is second. Shortly after killing Susan Delgado, Cordelia has a stroke and dies.\n\n===Mia===\nAn invading spirit who [[Spirit possession|possesses]] Susannah Dean's body in ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]''. Originally an immortal spirit similar to a [[succubus]], she saw and fell in love with a baby and longed to have one of her own (an unknown force kept her from coming too close to the child she loved and taking it for herself). Long after a plague ravaged the town of Fedic and the child was taken away, Mia struck a bargain with Walter/Flagg. If she would give up her formless immortality, Walter would give her a baby. Mia's purpose in Walter's and the Crimson King's plan is to bear Roland's child; prophecy has foretold that this child will be Roland's doom.\n\nMia called the child her \"chap\", and it was carried by both Susannah and Mia. Susannah had become pregnant with Roland's seed from the demon she copulated with in ''[[The Waste Lands]]'', during Jake's Drawing. The demon, a hermaphrodite able to change its sex, had copulated previously with Roland as a female in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' while Roland protected Jake and queried it for information. The demon had somehow preserved Roland's semen (and allowed it to be somehow mixed with that of the Crimson King's seed) and impregnated Susannah with it while male. Mia possessed Susannah in order to take over the birthing of her \"chap\".\n\nMia is killed and eaten by her child, Mordred, shortly after giving birth.\n\n===Mordred Deschain===\nSon of two fathers and two mothers, Mordred was born of Susannah's egg fertilized by the seed of both Roland of Gilead and the Crimson King, and carried to term by Mia. Mordred is half-human, half-spider, able to transform between the two, and if his fate is fulfilled, he will both kill Roland and topple the Dark Tower itself. He is both very powerful and extremely arrogant. Growing at a rapid speed, Mordred passes from childhood through adolescence in a matter of months. His abilities include the ability to change between human form and spider form at will and absorbing a victim's knowledge and experience by devouring them. Mordred becomes deathly ill after eating poisoned horse meat, and when he makes a final attempt to kill Roland, he is attacked by Oy. Oy is able to distract Mordred long enough to allow Roland to wake up and kill his son at the threshold of the Dark Tower.\n\n===Richard Patrick Sayre===\nRichard Patrick Sayre is a high-ranking can-toi and a member of the Sombra Corporation. Like the other members of his race, he dresses in garishly colored clothing and has a raw spot on his forehead that continually wells up with blood without scabbing or spilling down his face.\n \nAs revealed in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'', Sayre lured Father Callahan to Sombra's offices by offering a million dollars to the charity he was working for. It was a trap, where Sayre intended to use Type Three vampires to give Callahan AIDS. His plan failed when Callahan committed suicide by jumping out the window.\n\nIn ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]'', Sayre is the man in charge of delivering Mia's baby. He calls Susannah/Mia in their hotel room, telling them to go to the Dixie Pig. He takes them through the door into Fedic, where Mia is placed on a bed to deliver Mordred Deschain. After his birth, Susannah grabs a gun and shoots Sayre in the head.\n\nIn the [[The Dark Tower (2017 film)|film adaptation of The Dark Tower]] from 2017, Sayre is played by [[Jackie Earl Haley]].\n\n===Finli O'Tego===\nFinli O'Tego is a weasel-headed [[Taheen]] that appeared in the fifth and seventh ''Dark Tower'' books; he was referred to briefly in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'', before reemerging as a fully fleshed out character in ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nFinli is an assistant and close friend to [[Pimli Prentiss]] and helped in the running of [[Devar-Toi]]. Like most Taheen, he has psychic abilities; he also enjoys eating pus, offered by Prentiss as he breaks the pimples that erupt on his face. He is credited with orchestrating the re-capture of [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Ted Brautigan]], an event described in [[Hearts in Atlantis]]. During the siege of Algul Siento by Roland's ka-tet, Finli was mortally injured and ultimately put out of his misery by [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]].\n\n===Enrico Balazar===\nEnrico Balazar is a New York criminal kingpin first introduced in ''[[The Drawing of the Three]]''. He manages a club called \"The Leaning Tower\" and has a fascination with building houses of cards on his desk. Among his actions in the series are: kidnapping Eddie Dean's older brother, Henry (who in turn overdoses on heroin before he can be saved), running over Jake with his car and killing him for the first time, and hiring out his musclemen to the Sombra Corporation. Enrico is killed by Eddie and Roland in Dark Tower II, but a parallel-earth version of him is alive and mentioned in books VI and VII.\n\n===Jack Andolini===\nJack Andolini is a New York gangster and affiliate of Enrico Balazar, whom readers first met in ''[[The Drawing of the Three]]''. In that novel, he followed Eddie and Roland from Earth to Mid-World (via magic door) and was promptly eaten alive by lobstrosities (after suffering major wounds to his face and arm during gunplay with Roland). He reappears, first in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'' and later in ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'' as a representative of the Sombra Corporation, in a parallel-earth, 1977. When Roland and Eddie enter the Maine of 1977, Andolini and his gang ambush them at the East Stoneham General Store. This version of Andolini meets a less horrible fate: he is imprisoned in a Maine county jail.\n\n===Dandelo===\nDandelo is a psychic vampire who feeds on emotions. He makes an appearance in the final book in the series, ''[[The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower|The Dark Tower]]''. Using the name of 'Joe Collins', he lures Roland and Susannah into his cottage on Odd Lane (the street that crosses Tower Road in the White Lands of Empathica, and an anagram of \"Dandelo\") and treats them to a feast. Afterward, he tells them that before entering All-World, he was a stand-up comedian. Roland asks to hear some of his act, during which Dandelo comes close to making Roland laugh to death. Susannah avoids entrapment because she is in the bathroom at the time, tending to a troublesome sore on her face. There she discovers a note apparently left by Stephen King himself (the note even acknowledges itself as a [[deus ex machina]]) that helps her puzzle out Joe's true identity. Before he can sap all of Roland's life force, Dandelo is killed by Susannah with two shots to the head.\n\nIt is later revealed that he had kept [[Patrick Danville]] captive as a 'food source' to drain of emotions; at one point Dandelo ripped out Danville's tongue, preventing him from speaking.\n\n===Lippy===\nDandelo had a stable behind his house, in which he kept a blind [[horse]] named Lippy. Lippy whinnied when she sensed Roland, Susannah and Oy approach. She was very old, ragged, and had holes in her coat. When Dandelo is slain by the gunslingers, Lippy flees her stable, but returns to seek shelter from a winter storm\u2014only to be shot down by Roland. After the gunslingers have moved on, [[Mordred Deschain]], starving after weathering the storm out in the wilderness, fed on Lippy's corpse, which poisoned him and eventually contributed to his downfall.\n\n===Tick-Tock Man===\nThe Tick-Tock Man (real name Andrew Quick) is the leader of the Grays of Lud. He first appears in ''[[The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands|The Waste Lands]]''.\n\nHe is the great-grandson of David Quick. His left eye was punctured by Oy during a fight, and Jake shot him in the leg, and then in the head with a .22 pistol. He was left for dead, but survived, the bullet having only grazed his skull and torn off a flap of skin. In ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', Randall Flagg rescues him and takes him to the Emerald Palace, where he attacks Roland's ka-tet, and is shot and killed by Eddie and Susannah. He seems to be a successor to the Trashcan Man from ''[[The Stand]]'', as both were followers of Flagg who repeated the mantra \"My life for you\" in regard to their loyalty to him.\n\n===Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions)===\nAndy was one of the main antagonists in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]''. Andy was created by Lamerk Industries (the same company that made the Twelve Guardians) and had lived in the Calla for thousands of years. He was obsessed with telling people their horoscopes, like Blaine the Mono was obsessed with riddles. Andy played music from a speaker in his chest and was loved by all the children in the Calla. He used this closeness with children to gather information and the whereabouts of the children of the Calla to Finli O'Tego. The information was used so that the Wolves, who were really robots disguised as monsters, could locate the children and take them into the Thunderclap. Andy's sinister nature was uncovered by [[Jake Chambers]], who hid in an ancient control center and overheard Andy talking to Ben Slightman Sr. about the Wolves. Andy claimed he didn't know much about the Wolves (under Directive Nineteen), but he always told the townsfolk when they were coming a month in advance. Andy was finally put to rest by Eddie, who blinded him by shooting his eyes out and then ordering him to shut down under Directive Nineteen. Andy was buried underneath a pile of manure in an outhouse.\n\n===Pimli Prentiss===\nPimli Prentiss is the warden of [[Devar-Toi|Algul Siento]]. He is described as being tall, overweight, and balding. Pimli Prentiss (born \"Paul Prentiss\"; he adopted the taheen name Pimli during his induction ceremony) was recruited by the Crimson King to run Algul Siento, the Crimson King's prison for [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Breakers]]. He got the job by replying to a help wanted advertisement in a daily newspaper. Pimli was not a resident of the plane that Algul Siento existed on, but a parallel Earth very similar to our own, where he worked as a prison guard.\n\nPimli is shown to be cautious and restrained in his approach to his service to the Crimson King. He relies on his humanity and spirituality to guide him in his endeavors. He is portrayed as being a newly devout Catholic. This devotion to Catholicism is apparently triggered by his experiences in [[All-World|End-World]].\n\nPimli was killed by [[Roland Deschain|Roland Deschain's]] ka-tet during the raid on Algul Siento. Before dying, he was able to inflict a mortal gunshot wound on [[Eddie Dean (The Dark Tower)|Eddie Dean]], thus breaking Roland's ka-tet.\n\n==Neutral==\n\n===Gan===\nThe being ''Gan'' is first mentioned by name in ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah|Song of Susannah]]'', the sixth installment in the series. He is described as speaking \"through the voices of the can-calah, who men call [[angel]]s,\" and as \"denying the [[Crimson King]] and denying [[Eris (mythology)|Discordia]] itself.\" Gan's role in the novels is very much in line with the concept of [[God]]. In the cosmology of Stephen King's multiverse, Gan is that which the High Speech term [[Glossary of The Dark Tower#The Red, the White, and the Black|\"The White\"]] refers to. Gan rose from the Prim (implied as being the darkness behind everything) and created the universes and infinite alternate universes that the Dark Tower (a building that serves as a microcosm of all of the multiple realities of the ''Dark Tower'' series) holds in place.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Alice===\n\nA barmaid in Tull seen in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. She befriended Roland and told him about the story of Nort. Roland knew she would eventually ask Nort about the number Nineteen and knew this was a trap set up by The Man in Black. After she had asked Nort about the number Nineteen, Roland shot her in the head as she wished, as she could not bear what she was told. She was briefly recognised by Jake in ''[[The Waste Lands]]'' in New York.\n \n===Hart Thorin===\n\nMayor of Mejis first seen in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'', brother of Coral Thorin and husband of Olive Thorin. Murdered by Roy Depape.\n\n===James Farson===\nFarson's nephew is a young, slim musician. He has short, straight, black hair and dark eyes. He is a high-ranking soldier or henchmen of Farson's Revolutionary Army, and one who met Gabrielle Deschain in their plans for the murder of Steven Deschain. He is always seen near his uncle, not directly in battle.\n\n===Nort===\n\nAppeared in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. Nort dies twice: once prior to Roland's stay in Tull, and once later at Roland's hand. Alice retells the story of Nort's first death\u2014and subsequent resurrection\u2014to Roland. Nort dies in Sheb's bar. He is described as a drunk and a user of devil-grass\u2014one who has graduated from smoking it to chewing it, to Roland's shock and disgust. On the afternoon that he dies, The Man in Black appears and revives him in front of the regulars in the bar. He then hands Alice a note which states that if she speaks the code word \"nineteen\" to Nort, he will tell her of the secrets beyond Death. The note is intended as a trap; Alice eventually falls prey to it and says the word, triggering a town-wide frenzy against Roland in which he kills the entire population. Nort is last seen hanging above Sheb's bar, spread-eagled and crucified with wooden pegs, with a large and purple cloven hoof on his forehead. It is unclear who committed this crime, but it is likely the work of either Sylvia Pittston\u2014who had referenced the cloven hoof in her sermon\u2014or one of her followers, over whom she had a high degree of control.\n\n===Olive Thorin===\n\nWife of Hart Thorin first seen in ''[[Wizard and Glass]]''. Despite being pushed aside by her husband in favour of Susan Delgado, she was kind to Susan and tried to help her escape Mejis. Out of the original meeting between the townspeople and Roland, Cuthbert and Alain, she was the only one who Roland liked. Helped Susan escape from Mejis; however, was killed by Clay Reynolds before Susan was returned by Rhea for the reaping.\n\n===Sheb===\n\nSheb was a piano player first seen in ''[[The Gunslinger]]''. He was in Mejis at some point of his life before ending up in Tull. He originally did not recognise Roland until Roland prompts him by mentioning Susan Delgado. He is killed by Roland. He is seen again in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'' in a minor role during Roland's tale from Mejis.\n\n===Sylvia Pittston===\n\nA preacher seen in ''[[The Gunslinger]]'' and preaches to the town of Tull about \"The Interloper\" and how the town should cast him down. She implies this to be Roland. She is killed by Roland. Coral Thorin briefly mentions Sylvia Pittston in ''[[The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass|Wizard and Glass]]'' about how she passed through the town a year prior to events of the story.\n\n===Tim Ross===\n\nAppears in ''[[The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'' as part of Roland's story to Bill. Tim Ross lives with his mother Nell in a forgotten village that fears the annual collection of property taxes by a man named The Covenant Man. Tim recently lost his father, who was said to have been killed by a dragon while in the woods chopping trees. After the death of his father, Nell, no longer able to pay the taxes to keep their home, marries his father's best friend and business partner Bern Kells, who moves in with them. Kells is a mean man, prone to heavy drinking, who begins to abuse both Tim and Nell. One day The Covenant Man comes to collect the taxes, and he secretly tells Tim to meet him later in the woods. During this meeting, The Covenant Man reveals to Tim that it was actually Kells who killed his father, not a dragon, and with help of a scrying bowl shows Kells beating his mother, causing her to go blind. Later, The Covenant Man sends Tim a vision telling him that if Tim again visits The Covenant Man in the woods, he will give Tim magic that will allow his mother to see again. Tim, armed with a gun given to him by his school teacher, journeys into the dangerous woods, and is led into a swamp by the mischievous fairy, Armaneeta. Here, Tim almost becomes victim to a dragon and other mysterious swamp creatures, but he is saved by his gun as well as a group of friendly swamp people, who mistake him for a gunslinger. The swamp people guide him to the far side of the swamp, and equip him with a small mechanical talking device from the 'Old People' that helps guide him on his journey. Eventually, Tim arrives at a Dogan where he finds a caged 'tyger' and befriends the tyger. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket. Returning home, Tim brings sight back to his mother. Tim is attacked by Kells, who had secretly entered the home as Tim tended to his mother, but the boy is saved by his mother, who kills Kells with her late husband's ax.\n\nLater in life, Tim becomes a gunslinger in his own right, known first as Lefty Ross and then as Tim Stoutheart.\n\n===Tyger===\n\nA Tyger seen in ''[[The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole]]'' as part of Roland's story to Bill and implied to be the guardian of the Beam of the Cat. Tim Ross arrives at a Dogan where he finds Tyger, which wears the key to the Dogan around its neck. A starkblast approaches, and Tim, realizing this is likely a trap set for him by The Covenant Man (also known as Randall Flagg and the Man in Black) befriends the tyger. Tim and the tyger ride out the storm under a magical protective blanket. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket.\n\n==Other==\n\n===North Central Positronics===\nNorth Central Positronics appears in multiple works of Stephen King, in the Dark Tower series and related works. It is a huge corporation which manufactures technologically advanced items such as [[robot]]s, [[computer]]s, and weapons. Many of the products are prominent in the [[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]] series, where the few remaining North Central Positronics products still functioning have gone [[insane]], preying upon life and the remnants of [[civilization]]. This is related to the phenomenon affecting much of reality; everything is falling apart. As stated in the books, the world has \"moved on\".\n\nBy the time it is encountered by [[Roland of Gilead|Roland]] and his [[Ka (Dark Tower)|ka-tet]], North Central Positronics is part of the [[Sombra Corporation|Sombra Group]], owned by the [[Crimson King]], the personification of [[evil]] in the world of the Dark Tower. LaMerk Industries and LaMerk Foundry are two other entities which appear to be subsidiaries of the Sombra Group. The Crimson King's stated goal is the destruction of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]/all reality.\n\nAmong NCP's creations in the books are dipolar computers, a number of [[Android (robot)|android]]s and [[cyborg]]s (namely the Guardians of the beams, including [[Shardik (Dark Tower)#Shardik|Shardik]] the Bear and Maturin the Turtle), Stuttering Bill (one of the few robots the Ka-Tet encounter that is not hostile and actually aids them in their quest), Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions), and [[Blaine the Mono]], a highly intelligent and sadistic monorail system that enjoys riddles. In \"The Waste Lands,\" Jake and Gasher, and later Roland, enter the underworld of the city of Lud via an iron manhole which is protected by a cover stamped with the label \"LaMerk Foundry.\"\n\nIn ''The Dark Tower: End-World Almanac'' published by [[Marvel Comics]], one of North Central Positronics' major products is said to be the \"[[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]-class robot\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{DarkTower}}\n{{Characters created by Stephen King}}\n\n[[Category:The Dark Tower characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters|Dark Tower, The]]\n", "name_user": "Packer1028", "label": "safe", "comment": "italics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Dark_Tower_characters"}

Whilst walking home from an errand late at night, Naru comes across a blonde haired girl dancing in the moonlight, believing her to be a fairy and asking her to take her to another world. The girl invites Naru to dance with her, but Naru isn't confident enough and runs off, inadvertently taking a paddle with her. The next day, the girl, who turns out to be an American transfer student named Hana N. Fountainstand, starts asking Naru if she would like to partake in [[yosakoi]] with her, but Naru is too intimidated by her forwardness and rejects her. The next day, as Hana continues to try to find members for a yosakoi club, she explains to Naru that even though she's having no luck in finding any members, she wants to pursue her dream of becoming a true yosakoi dancer because it is her decision. Naru laments that she has no such interests to speak of and considers herself empty, but Hana tells her that it simply means she has plenty of room to discover new things. Moved by her words and admitting she had fun dancing with her, Naru offers to help Hana recruit members for her club and becomes friends with her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Jealousy Rose\n| TranslitTitle       = Jerash\u012b r\u014dzu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b8\u30a7\u30e9\u30b7\u30fc\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Kinsei Nakamura\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2014|7|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hana comes over to Naru's house to discuss how to attract more club members, where she reveals a bit more about herself and teaches Naru about the paddle yosakoi dancers use, the [[Yosakoi#Costumes and naruko|naruko]].

When Yaya's jealousy leads her to inadvertently insult Naru, questioning her ability to take yosakoi seriously, Naru argues back at her, determined to prove she is capable of learning yosakoi within a week. Wanting the two to make up, Hana takes Yaya to watch Naru's practice, showing that even though Naru is struggling to get the moves down, she continues to try hard in order to meet Yaya's approval.

Naru laments that she has no such interests to speak of and considers herself empty, but Hana tells her that it simply means she has plenty of room to discover new things.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on a rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K.

Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on a rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill  on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharshtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both side of the Hill. Further down the southern slopes of the hill resided the Late Nagris Dutt and her husband the late Sunil Dutt, the two besides been thespians were also connected politically Mr Sunil Dutt, a politician, after he joined the Indian National Congress party, he had the unique distinction of getting elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the Mumbai North West constituency.\nOn the bend is the Residence of the famous Dilip Kumar whose thespian wife Saira Banu live therein.\n\nDown towards Union Park & Golf Links at the North end if the hill is the residence of the former chief minister of Maharashtra Mr Narayan Rane.\nThe Golf Course today is no more, it is filed by high rise buildings over seeing the nets of The \"Danda' fishing Village.\n\nOther landmarks include Kangaroo Kids Nursery and Playschool, Juice Salon, Sundaram Stores, cozy home apartments. At Union Park lies Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School.\ndown the slope on the eastern side is the Pali Market, now under reconstruction.\nIn the 19th Century Pali Hill was called Pakhari HIll\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n* President of The Indian Music Industry & Phonographic Performance Ltd. and Ex-Chairman of Polygram Music Ltd. and Universal Music India, Vijay Lazarus;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013738/http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |archive-date=18 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[Indian Music Industry]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioandmusic.com/biz/music/representative-bodies/imi/imi-president-vijay-lazarus-differences-radio-industry-need-be-bridged|title=IMI president Vijay Lazarus - Differences with the radio industry need to be bridged|website=www.radioandmusic.com}}</ref>\n* Late politician and actor, [[Sunil Dutt]]'s bungalow, as well as his daughter and Member of Parliament [[Priya Dutt]]'s and her brother [[Sanjay Dutt]]'s building;\n*[[Kripashankar Singh]] EX- Home Minister of Maharashtra, Presidents of [[Mumbai Regional Congress Committee|Mumbai Congress]], & MLA From [[Kalina (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Kalina]] \n* [[Kumar Gaurav]] of Love Story fame\n* Actor [[Dilip Kumar]]'s and [[Saira Banu]]'s bungalow (currently caught in a heritage structure row and in a semi-ruin state);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/We-dont-want-Bollywood-in-our-backyard/articleshow/16119072.cms|title=We don't want Bollywood in our backyard|last=Apr 18|first=Updated|last2=2011|website=Mumbai Mirror|language=en|access-date=2019-07-31|last3=Ist|first3=02:40}}</ref>\n* Film personality Nasir's Hussain's bungalow \u2013 Pali Annexe (now being renovated); with grandson [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]\n* [[Rajendranath Zutshi]] at Summer Palace\n* [[Aamir Khan]]'s flat at Belavista and [[Faisal Khan]] at Marina Apartments near the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School at Union Park;\n* Film maker and director [[Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra]]'s bungalow \u2013 Mamta\n* [[Gulzar]], poet, lyricist, writer, at his bungalow Boskiyana\n* [[Gulshan Bawra]], lyricist<ref name=down>{{cite web |title=Down the memory lane with Gulshan Bawra |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/07/09/2839/index.html |date=9 July 2007 |publisher=Screen Weekly }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]], his wife [[Neetu Kapoor]] at the bungalow Krishna Raj\n*[[Ranbir Kapoor]] at Vastu Apartment with [[Alia Bhatt]]\n* [[Narayan Rane]] at Gautam Apartments\n* Actors [[Sanjeev Kumar]] near Petit School \n* [[Prem Chopra]], [[Moushmi Chatterjee]], [[Vinod Mehra]] and others\n* [[Anil Dhawan]], at Nibbana Apartments; \n* [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] and his family\n* Actor [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] and other eminent Film production icons\n* [[Mahesh Bhatt]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] who used to stay at Green Acres\n* Models [[Tapur Chatterjee]] and [[Kirat Bhattal]] \n* [[Anna Singh]], fashion designer\n* [[Sameer Pitalwalla]], CEO of [[Culture Machine]]\n* [[Haresh Chawla]], CEO of [[CNBC-TV18]]\n* [[Kunal Kapoor]], film director\n* [[Emraan Hashmi]], Bollywood Actor; at Nibhana\n* [[Asha Sachdev]] at Sunset Heights\n* [[A.M.

Players alternate placing markers or stones on unoccupied spaces in an attempt to link their opposite sides of the board in an unbroken chain.  One player must win; there are no draws.  The game has deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]]. It was invented in the 1940s independently by two mathematicians, [[Piet Hein (scientist)|Piet Hein]] and [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]].  The game was first marketed as a board game in [[Denmark]] under the name '''Con-tac-tix''', and [[Parker Brothers]] marketed a version of it in 1952 called '''Hex'''; they are no longer in production.  Hex can also be played with paper and pencil on hexagonally ruled graph paper.\n\nHex-related research is current in the areas of topology, graph and [[matroid]] theory, combinatorics, game theory and artificial intelligence.\n\n==Game type==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nHex is a [[connection game]], and can be classified as a [[Maker-Breaker game]], a particular type of [[positional game]]. The game can never end in a [[draw (tie)]], in other words, Hex is also a \"[[determined game]]\".\n\nHex is a finite, [[perfect information]] game, and an [[abstract strategy game]] that belongs to the general category of ''[[connection game]]s''.  When played on a generalized graph, it is equivalent to the [[Shannon switching game]].\n\nAs a product, Hex is a [[board game]]; it may also be played with [[Paper-and-pencil game|paper and pencil]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Published games===\n[[File:Hex zig-zag.jpg|thumb|A Parker Brothers edition of the game]]\nThe game was invented by the [[Denmark|Danish]] mathematician [[Piet Hein (scientist)|Piet Hein]], who introduced it in 1942 at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]. Although Hein called it Con-tac-tix,<ref name=\"ContactixManual\">{{cite book |title=Con-tac-tix manual |url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Con-Tac-Tix.PDF |year=1968 |publisher= Parker Brothers}}</ref> it became known in Denmark under the name ''Polygon'' due to an article by Hein in the December 26, 1942 edition of the Danish newspaper ''Politiken'', the first published description of the game, in which he used that name. The game was independently re-invented in 1948 by the mathematician [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] at [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"Gardner1\">{{cite book\n|title=The Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles & Diversions|url=https://archive.org/details/scientificameric02gard|url-access=registration|last= Gardner|first= M.|year= 1959|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location=N.Y., N.Y.|isbn= 0-226-28254-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/scientificameric02gard/page/73 73\u201383]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Nasar|first1=Sylvia|title=The Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/14/reviews/nasar-nash.html|accessdate=23 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 13, 1994}}</ref>  According to [[Martin Gardner]], who featured Hex in his July 1957 [[Mathematical Games column]], Nash's fellow players called the game either Nash or John, with the latter name referring to the fact that the game could be played on hexagonal bathroom tiles.<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/>  In 1952, [[Parker Brothers]] marketed a version. They called their version \"Hex\" and the name stuck.<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/> [[Parker Brothers]] also sold a version under the \"Con-tac-tix\" name in 1968.<ref name=\"ContactixManual\"/> Hex was also issued as one of the games in the 1974 3M Paper Games Series; the game contained a 5\u00bd \u00d7 8\u00bd inch 50-sheet pad of ruled hex grids.\n\n===Shannon's hex machine===\nAbout 1950, American mathematician and electrical engineer [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Edward F. Moore|E. F. Moore]] constructed an analog Hex playing machine, which was essentially a resistance network with resistors for edges and lightbulbs for vertices.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shannon | first1 = C. | year = 1953 | title = Computers and Automata | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers | volume = 41 | issue = 10| pages = 1234\u201341 | doi=10.1109/jrproc.1953.274273}}</ref>  The move to be made corresponded to a certain specified saddle point in the network. The machine played a reasonably good game of Hex.  Later, researchers attempting to solve the game and develop hex-playing computer algorithms emulated Shannon's network to make strong automatons.<ref>Anshelevich, V. (2002).  A Hierarchical Approach to Computer Hex.</ref>\n\n===Research===\nIn 1952 John Nash expounded an existence proof that on symmetrical boards, the first player has a winning strategy.\n\nIn 1964, mathematician [[Alfred Lehman]] showed that Hex cannot be represented as a [[binary matroid]], so a determinate winning strategy like that for the Shannon switching game on a regular rectangular grid was unavailable.  The game was later shown to be PSPACE-complete.\n\nIn 2002, the first explicit winning strategy (a reduction-type strategy) on a 7\u00d77 board was described.\n\nIn the 2000s, by using [[Brute-force search|brute force]] search computer algorithms, Hex boards up to size 9\u00d79 (as of 2016) have been completely solved.\n\n===Automatons===\nIn the early 1980s Dolphin Microware published ''Hexmaster'', an implementation for [[Atari 8-bit]] computers.<ref name=\"kucherawy198401\">{{Cite magazine |last=Kucherawy |first=Murray |date=January 1984 |title=Hexmaster |url=https://archive.org/details/1984-01-anticmagazine/page/n111 |magazine=Antic |page=112 |access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> Various paradigms resulting from research into the game have been used to create digital computer Hex playing automatons starting about 2000.  The first implementations used evaluation functions that emulated Shannon and Moore's electrical circuit model embedded in an alpha-beta search framework with hand-crafted knowledge-based patterns.  Starting about 2006, Monte Carlo tree search methods borrowed from successful computer implementations of Go were introduced and soon dominated the field.  Later, hand crafted patterns were supplemented by machine learning methods for pattern discovery.  These programs are now competitive against skilled human players. [[Elo rating system|Elo based ratings]] have been assigned to the various programs and can be used to measure technical progress as well as assess playing strength against Elo-rated humans.  Current research is often published in either the quarterly ''[[ICGA Journal]]'' or the annual ''Advances in Computer Games'' series (van den Herik et al. eds.).\n\n==Game play==\n[[File:HEX 11x11 (47).jpg|thumb|Black vs white on a hex board]]\n\nEach player has an allocated color, conventionally Red and Blue or White and Black.<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/>  Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. Once placed, stones are not moved, captured or removed from the board (similar to the game of [[go (game)|go]]). The goal for each player is to form a connected path of their own stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colors, before their opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game. The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.\n\nIt is not necessary to construct a complete chain between sides or fill up the whole board before the game is decided (but if it does by construction, the player placing the last stone will win); usually only 1/3 to 40% of the board is filled before it becomes obvious that one player or the other can force a win.  This is somewhat analogous to chess games ending long before checkmate - the game usually ends with one player or the other resigning.\n\nSince the first player to move in Hex has a distinct advantage, the [[pie rule]] is generally implemented for fairness. This rule allows the second player to choose whether to switch positions with the first player after the first player makes the first move.\n\n==Strategy==\n{{one source|section|date=January 2017}}\n{{missing information|section|diagrams 2 - 3|date=January 2017}}\nFrom the proof of a winning strategy for the first player, it is known that the hex board must have a complex type of connectivity which has never been solved. Play consists of creating small patterns which have a simpler type of connectivity called \"safely connected\", and joining them into sequences that form a \"path\". Eventually, one of the players will succeed in forming a safely connected path of stones and spaces between his sides of the board and win.  The final stage of the game, if necessary, consists of filling in the empty spaces in the path.<ref name=\"Browne p\">Browne p.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Hex situation bridge.svg|thumb|right|Diagram 1: bridge (A <--> C), a safely connected pattern]]\n\nA \"safely connected\" pattern is composed of stones of the player's color and open spaces which can  be joined into a chain, an unbroken sequence of edge-wise adjacent stones, no matter how the opponent plays.<ref>Browne, p.28</ref>  One of the simplest such patterns is the bridge (see diagram 1), which consists of two stones of the same color (A and C), and a pair of open spaces (B and D).<ref>Browne, p.29-30</ref>  If the opponent plays in either space, the player plays in the other, creating a contiguous chain.  There are also safely connected patterns which connect stones to edges.<ref>Browne, p.71-77</ref>  One such pattern, analogous to the bridge, is shown in diagram 2.  There are many more safely connected patterns, some quite complex, built up of simpler ones like those shown. Patterns and paths can be disrupted by the opponent before they are complete, so the configuration of the board during an actual game often looks like a patchwork rather than something planned or designed.<ref name=\"Browne p\"/>\n\nThere are weaker types of connectivity than \"safely connected\" which exist between stones or between safely connected patterns which have multiple spaces between them.<ref name=\"Browne, p\">Browne, p.</ref>  The middle part of the game consists of creating a network of such weakly connected stones and patterns<ref name=\"Browne, p\"/> which hopefully will allow the player, by filling in the weak links, to construct just one safely connected path (see diagram 3) between sides as the game progresses.<ref name=\"Browne, p\"/>\n\nSuccess at hex requires a particular ability to visualize synthesis of complex patterns in a heuristic way, and estimating whether such patterns are 'strongly enough' connected to enable an eventual win.<ref name=\"Browne p\"/> The skill is somewhat similar to the visualization of patterns, sequencing of moves, and evaluating of positions in chess.<ref>Lasker, p.</ref>\n\n==Theory and proofs==\nJohn Nash was the first to prove (c. 1949) that Hex cannot end in a draw, a non-trivial result colloquially called the \"Hex theorem\", which we now know is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.  Apparently, he didn't publish the proof.  The first exposition of it appears in an in-house technical report in 1952,<ref>Nash, John (Feb. 1952). Rand Corp. technical report D-1164: Some Games and Machines for Playing Them. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/documents/2015/D1164.pdf</ref> in which he states that \"connection and blocking the opponent are equivalent acts.\" The earliest published proof of the [[determinacy]] of Hex, by [[David Gale]] in 1979,<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Gale |year=1979|title=The Game of Hex and Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=86 | pages=818\u2013827|doi=10.2307/2320146|jstor=2320146|issue=10|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> also showed that it can be used to prove the two-dimensional [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]], and that the determinacy of higher-dimensional variants proves the fixed-point theorem in general. A brief sketch of the no-draw ending requirement of Hex from that paper is presented below:\n\n# Begin with a Hex board completely filled with hexagons marked with either X or O (indicating which player played on that hexagon).\n# Starting at a hexagon vertex at the corner of the board where the X side and O sides meet, draw a path along the edges between hexagons with different X/O markings.\n# Since every vertex of the path is surrounded by three hexagons, the path cannot self-intersect or loop, since the intersecting portion of the path would have to approach between two hexagons of the same marking. So, the path must terminate.\n# The path cannot terminate in the middle of the board since every edge of the path ends in a node surrounded by three hexagons\u2014two of which have to be differently marked by construction. The third hexagon must be differently marked from the two adjacent to the path, so the path can continue to one side or the other of the third hexagon.\n# Similarly, if the sides of the board are considered to be a solid wall of X or O hexagons, depending on which player is trying to connect there, then the path cannot terminate on the sides.\n# Thus the path can only terminate on another corner.\n# The hexagons on either side of the line form an unbroken chain of X hexagons on one side and O hexagons on the other by construction.\n# The path cannot terminate on the opposite corner because the X and O markings would be reversed at that corner, violating the construction rule of the path.\n# Since the path connects adjacent corners, the side of the board between the two corners (say, an X side) is cut off from the rest of the board by an unbroken chain of the opposite markings (O in this case).

In Hex, the average branching factor is a function of the ply depth. It has been stated that the average branching factor is about 100;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} that implies an average ply depth of 43 (there will be 121 open spaces on the board when the first player is to make his first move, and 79 when he is to make his 22nd move, the 43rd ply - the average number of open spaces, i.e. branching factor, during the game is (121+120+...+79)/43=100).  Therefore, the game tree size has an upper bound of approximately 100<sup>43</sup> = 10<sup>86</sup>.<ref>The exact number of nodes is actually 121*120*...*79=121!/78!=7.4*10<sup>85</sup>.</ref>  The bound includes some number of illegal positions due to playing on when there is a complete chain for one player or the other, as well as excludes legal positions for games longer than 43 ply.  Another researcher obtained a state space estimate of 10<sup>57</sup> and a game tree size of 10<sup>98</sup> using an upper limit of 50 plies for the game.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This compares to 10<sup>123</sup> node game tree size of chess.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nInteresting game tree reductions are available by noting that the board has dual bilateral symmetry as well as 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry: for each position, a topologically identical position is obtained by flipping the board left-right, top-bottom, or rotating it 180\u00b0.\n\n==Variants==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nOther connection games with similar objectives but different structures include [[Shannon switching game]] and [[TwixT]]. All of these games bear varying degrees of similarity to the ancient Asian game of [[Go (board game)|Go]].\n\n===Rectangular grids and paper and pencil===\nThe game may be played on a rectangular grid like a chess, checker or go board, by considering that spaces (intersections in the case of go) are connected in one diagonal direction but not the other. The game may be played with paper and pencil on a rectangular array of dots or graph paper in the same way by using two different colored pencils.\n\n=== Board sizes ===\nPopular dimensions other than the standard 11x11 are 13\u00d713 and 19\u00d719 as a result of the game's relationship to the older game of [[Go (board game)|Go]].  According to the book ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] (one of the game's inventors) advocated 14\u00d714 as the optimal size.\n\n=== [[Mis\u00e8re]] hex ===\nA variation has been described in which each player tries to force his opponent to make a chain.  This is a slow game.  A clever proof has been discovered that the first player can win on a board with an even number of cells per side, and the second player can win on a board with an odd number.<ref>Gardner (1959) p.78</ref><ref>Browne (2000) p.310</ref>\n\n===''Blockbusters''===\nHex had an incarnation as the question board from the television game show ''[[Blockbusters (U.S. game show)|Blockbusters]]''. In order to play a \"move\", contestants had to answer a question correctly. The board had 5 alternating columns of 4 hexagons; the solo player could connect top-to-bottom in 4 moves, while the team of two could connect left-to-right in 5 moves.\n\n===Y===\nThe [[Y (game)|game of Y]] is Hex played on a triangular grid of hexagons; the object is for either player to connect all three sides of the triangle.  Y is a generalization of Hex to the extent that any position on a Hex board can be represented as an equivalent position on a larger Y board.\n\n===Havannah===\n\n[[Havannah]] is a rather broadly defined variant of Hex played on a hexagonal grid of hexagons.  The objective is for either player to complete one of three characteristic patterns.\n\n=== Projex ===\nProjex is a variation of Hex played on a [[real projective plane]], where the players have the goal of creating a non[[contractible]] loop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31805/projex|title=Projex|website=BoardGameGeek|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> Like in Hex, there are no ties, and there is no position in which both players have a winning connection.\n<!-- \n    please don't add arbitrary gamer variants from private websites to the list; see talk page for qualifying criteria.

Players alternate placing markers or stones on unoccupied spaces in an attempt to link their opposite sides of the board in an unbroken chain.  One player must win; there are no draws.  The game has deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]]. It was invented in the 1940s independently by two mathematicians, [[Piet Hein (scientist)|Piet Hein]] and [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]].  The game was first marketed as a board game in [[Denmark]] under the name '''Con-tac-tix''', and [[Parker Brothers]] marketed a version of it in 1952 called '''Hex'''; they are no longer in production.  Hex can also be played with paper and pencil on hexagonally ruled graph paper.\n\nHex-related research is current in the areas of topology, graph and [[matroid]] theory, combinatorics, game theory and artificial intelligence.\n\n==Game type==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nHex is a [[connection game]], and can be classified as a [[Maker-Breaker game]], a particular type of [[positional game]]. The game can never end in a [[draw (tie)]], in other words, Hex is also a \"[[determined game]]\".\n\nHex is a finite, [[perfect information]] game, and an [[abstract strategy game]] that belongs to the general category of ''[[connection game]]s''.  When played on a generalized graph, it is equivalent to the [[Shannon switching game]].\n\nAs a product, Hex is a [[board game]]; it may also be played with [[Paper-and-pencil game|paper and pencil]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Published games===\n[[File:Hex zig-zag.jpg|thumb|A Parker Brothers edition of the game]]\nThe game was invented by the [[Denmark|Danish]] mathematician [[Piet Hein (scientist)|Piet Hein]], who introduced it in 1942 at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]. Although Hein called it Con-tac-tix,<ref name=\"ContactixManual\">{{cite book |title=Con-tac-tix manual |url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Con-Tac-Tix.PDF |year=1968 |publisher= Parker Brothers}}</ref> it became known in Denmark under the name ''Polygon'' due to an article by Hein in the December 26, 1942 edition of the Danish newspaper ''Politiken'', the first published description of the game, in which he used that name. The game was independently re-invented in 1948 by the mathematician [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] at [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"Gardner1\">{{cite book\n|title=The Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles & Diversions|url=https://archive.org/details/scientificameric02gard|url-access=registration|last= Gardner|first= M.|year= 1959|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location=N.Y., N.Y.|isbn= 0-226-28254-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/scientificameric02gard/page/73 73\u201383]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Nasar|first1=Sylvia|title=The Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/14/reviews/nasar-nash.html|accessdate=23 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 13, 1994}}</ref>  According to [[Martin Gardner]], who featured Hex in his July 1957 [[Mathematical Games column]], Nash's fellow players called the game either Nash or John, with the latter name referring to the fact that the game could be played on hexagonal bathroom tiles.<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/>  In 1952, [[Parker Brothers]] marketed a version. They called their version \"Hex\" and the name stuck.<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/> [[Parker Brothers]] also sold a version under the \"Con-tac-tix\" name in 1968.<ref name=\"ContactixManual\"/> Hex was also issued as one of the games in the 1974 3M Paper Games Series; the game contained a 5\u00bd \u00d7 8\u00bd inch 50-sheet pad of ruled hex grids.\n\n===Shannon's hex machine===\nAbout 1950, American mathematician and electrical engineer [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Edward F. Moore|E. F. Moore]] constructed an analog Hex playing machine, which was essentially a resistance network with resistors for edges and lightbulbs for vertices.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shannon | first1 = C. | year = 1953 | title = Computers and Automata | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers | volume = 41 | issue = 10| pages = 1234\u201341 | doi=10.1109/jrproc.1953.274273}}</ref>  The move to be made corresponded to a certain specified saddle point in the network. The machine played a reasonably good game of Hex.  Later, researchers attempting to solve the game and develop hex-playing computer algorithms emulated Shannon's network to make strong automatons.<ref>Anshelevich, V. (2002).  A Hierarchical Approach to Computer Hex.</ref>\n\n===Research===\nIn 1952 John Nash expounded an existence proof that on symmetrical boards, the first player has a winning strategy.\n\nIn 1964, mathematician [[Alfred Lehman]] showed that Hex cannot be represented as a [[binary matroid]], so a determinate winning strategy like that for the Shannon switching game on a regular rectangular grid was unavailable.  The game was later shown to be PSPACE-complete.\n\nIn 2002, the first explicit winning strategy (a reduction-type strategy) on a 7\u00d77 board was described.\n\nIn the 2000s, by using [[Brute-force search|brute force]] search computer algorithms, Hex boards up to size 9\u00d79 (as of 2016) have been completely solved.\n\n===Automatons===\nIn the early 1980s Dolphin Microware published ''Hexmaster'', an implementation for [[Atari 8-bit]] computers.<ref name=\"kucherawy198401\">{{Cite magazine |last=Kucherawy |first=Murray |date=January 1984 |title=Hexmaster |url=https://archive.org/details/1984-01-anticmagazine/page/n111 |magazine=Antic |page=112 |access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> Various paradigms resulting from research into the game have been used to create digital computer Hex playing automatons starting about 2000.  The first implementations used evaluation functions that emulated Shannon and Moore's electrical circuit model embedded in an alpha-beta search framework with hand-crafted knowledge-based patterns.  Starting about 2006, Monte Carlo tree search methods borrowed from successful computer implementations of Go were introduced and soon dominated the field.  Later, hand crafted patterns were supplemented by machine learning methods for pattern discovery.  These programs are now competitive against skilled human players. [[Elo rating system|Elo based ratings]] have been assigned to the various programs and can be used to measure technical progress as well as assess playing strength against Elo-rated humans.  Current research is often published in either the quarterly ''[[ICGA Journal]]'' or the annual ''Advances in Computer Games'' series (van den Herik et al. eds.).\n\n==Game play==\n[[File:HEX 11x11 (47).jpg|thumb|Black vs white on a hex board]]\n\nEach player has an allocated color, conventionally Red and Blue or White and Black.<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/>  Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. Once placed, stones are not moved, captured or removed from the board (similar to the game of [[go (game)|go]]). The goal for each player is to form a connected path of their own stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colors, before their opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game. The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.\n\nIt is not necessary to construct a complete chain between sides or fill up the whole board before the game is decided (but if it does by construction, the player placing the last stone will win); usually only 1/3 to 40% of the board is filled before it becomes obvious that one player or the other can force a win.  This is somewhat analogous to chess games ending long before checkmate - the game usually ends with one player or the other resigning.\n\nSince the first player to move in Hex has a distinct advantage, the [[pie rule]] is generally implemented for fairness. This rule allows the second player to choose whether to switch positions with the first player after the first player makes the first move.\n\n==Strategy==\n{{one source|section|date=January 2017}}\n{{missing information|section|diagrams 2 - 3|date=January 2017}}\nFrom the proof of a winning strategy for the first player, it is known that the hex board must have a complex type of connectivity which has never been solved. Play consists of creating small patterns which have a simpler type of connectivity called \"safely connected\", and joining them into sequences that form a \"path\". Eventually, one of the players will succeed in forming a safely connected path of stones and spaces between his sides of the board and win.  The final stage of the game, if necessary, consists of filling in the empty spaces in the path.<ref name=\"Browne p\">Browne p.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Hex situation bridge.svg|thumb|right|Diagram 1: bridge (A <--> C), a safely connected pattern]]\n\nA \"safely connected\" pattern is composed of stones of the player's color and open spaces which can  be joined into a chain, an unbroken sequence of edge-wise adjacent stones, no matter how the opponent plays.<ref>Browne, p.28</ref>  One of the simplest such patterns is the bridge (see diagram 1), which consists of two stones of the same color (A and C), and a pair of open spaces (B and D).<ref>Browne, p.29-30</ref>  If the opponent plays in either space, the player plays in the other, creating a contiguous chain.  There are also safely connected patterns which connect stones to edges.<ref>Browne, p.71-77</ref>  One such pattern, analogous to the bridge, is shown in diagram 2.  There are many more safely connected patterns, some quite complex, built up of simpler ones like those shown. Patterns and paths can be disrupted by the opponent before they are complete, so the configuration of the board during an actual game often looks like a patchwork rather than something planned or designed.<ref name=\"Browne p\"/>\n\nThere are weaker types of connectivity than \"safely connected\" which exist between stones or between safely connected patterns which have multiple spaces between them.<ref name=\"Browne, p\">Browne, p.</ref>  The middle part of the game consists of creating a network of such weakly connected stones and patterns<ref name=\"Browne, p\"/> which hopefully will allow the player, by filling in the weak links, to construct just one safely connected path (see diagram 3) between sides as the game progresses.<ref name=\"Browne, p\"/>\n\nSuccess at hex requires a particular ability to visualize synthesis of complex patterns in a heuristic way, and estimating whether such patterns are 'strongly enough' connected to enable an eventual win.<ref name=\"Browne p\"/> The skill is somewhat similar to the visualization of patterns, sequencing of moves, and evaluating of positions in chess.<ref>Lasker, p.</ref>\n\n==Theory and proofs==\nJohn Nash was the first to prove (c. 1949) that Hex cannot end in a draw, a non-trivial result colloquially called the \"Hex theorem\", which we now know is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.  Apparently, he didn't publish the proof.  The first exposition of it appears in an in-house technical report in 1952,<ref>Nash, John (Feb. 1952). Rand Corp. technical report D-1164: Some Games and Machines for Playing Them. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/documents/2015/D1164.pdf</ref> in which he states that \"connection and blocking the opponent are equivalent acts.\" The earliest published proof of the [[determinacy]] of Hex, by [[David Gale]] in 1979,<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Gale |year=1979|title=The Game of Hex and Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem | journal=The American Mathematical Monthly | volume=86 | pages=818\u2013827|doi=10.2307/2320146|jstor=2320146|issue=10|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref> also showed that it can be used to prove the two-dimensional [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]], and that the determinacy of higher-dimensional variants proves the fixed-point theorem in general. A brief sketch of the no-draw ending requirement of Hex from that paper is presented below:\n\n# Begin with a Hex board completely filled with hexagons marked with either X or O (indicating which player played on that hexagon).\n# Starting at a hexagon vertex at the corner of the board where the X side and O sides meet, draw a path along the edges between hexagons with different X/O markings.\n# Since every vertex of the path is surrounded by three hexagons, the path cannot self-intersect or loop, since the intersecting portion of the path would have to approach between two hexagons of the same marking. So, the path must terminate.\n# The path cannot terminate in the middle of the board since every edge of the path ends in a node surrounded by three hexagons\u2014two of which have to be differently marked by construction. The third hexagon must be differently marked from the two adjacent to the path, so the path can continue to one side or the other of the third hexagon.\n# Similarly, if the sides of the board are considered to be a solid wall of X or O hexagons, depending on which player is trying to connect there, then the path cannot terminate on the sides.\n# Thus the path can only terminate on another corner.\n# The hexagons on either side of the line form an unbroken chain of X hexagons on one side and O hexagons on the other by construction.\n# The path cannot terminate on the opposite corner because the X and O markings would be reversed at that corner, violating the construction rule of the path.\n# Since the path connects adjacent corners, the side of the board between the two corners (say, an X side) is cut off from the rest of the board by an unbroken chain of the opposite markings (O in this case). That unbroken chain necessarily connects the other two sides adjacent to the corners.\n# Thus, the completely filled Hex board must have a winner.\n\nThere is a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' [[existence proof]] attributed to John Nash c. 1949 that the first player in Hex on a board of any size has a [[Determinacy#Winning strategies|winning strategy]]. Such a proof gives no indication of a correct strategy for play.  The proof is common to a number of games including Hex, and has come to be called the \"strategy-stealing\" argument.  Here is a highly condensed informal statement of the proof:<ref name=\"Gardner1\"/>\n\n# Either the first or second player must win, therefore there must be a winning strategy for either the first or second player.\n# Let us assume that the second player has a winning strategy.\n# The first player can now adopt the following defense.  He makes an arbitrary move.  Thereafter he plays the winning second player strategy assumed above. If in playing this strategy, he is required to play on the cell where an arbitrary move was made, he makes another arbitrary move.  In this way he plays the winning strategy with one extra piece always on the board.\n# This extra piece cannot interfere with the first player's imitation of the winning strategy, for an extra piece is always an asset and never a handicap.  Therefore, the first player can win.\n# Because we have now contradicted our assumption that there is a winning strategy for the second player, we are forced to drop this assumption.\n# Consequently, there must be a winning strategy for the first player.\n\nIn 1976, [[Shimon Even]] and [[Robert Tarjan]] proved that determining whether a position in a game of generalized Hex played on arbitrary graphs is a winning position is [[PSPACE-complete]].<ref>S.

This result limits the efficiency of the best possible algorithms when considering arbitrary positions on boards of unbounded size, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of a simple winning strategy for the initial position (on boards of unbounded size), or a simple winning strategy for all positions on a board of a particular size.\n\nIn 2002, Jing Yang, Simon Liao and Mirek Pawlak found an explicit winning strategy for the first player on Hex boards of size 7\u00d77 using a decomposition method with a set of reusable local patterns.<ref>[http://zernike.uwinnipeg.ca/~s_liao/pdf/adcog21.pdf On a decomposition method for finding winning strategy in Hex game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402234617/http://zernike.uwinnipeg.ca/~s_liao/pdf/adcog21.pdf |date=2 April 2012 }}, Jing Yang, Simon Liao and Mirek Pawlak, 2002</ref> They extended the method to weakly solve the center pair of topologically congruent openings on 8\u00d78 boards in 2002 and the center opening on 9\u00d79 boards in 2003.<ref>Unpublished white papers, formerly @ www.ee.umanitoba.com/~jingyang/</ref>  In 2009, Philip Henderson, Broderick Arneson and Ryan B.

In Hex, the average branching factor is a function of the ply depth. It has been stated that the average branching factor is about 100;{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} that implies an average ply depth of 43 (there will be 121 open spaces on the board when the first player is to make his first move, and 79 when he is to make his 22nd move, the 43rd ply - the average number of open spaces, i.e. branching factor, during the game is (121+120+...+79)/43=100).  Therefore, the game tree size has an upper bound of approximately 100<sup>43</sup> = 10<sup>86</sup>.<ref>The exact number of nodes is actually 121*120*...*79=121!/78!=7.4*10<sup>85</sup>.</ref>  The bound includes some number of illegal positions due to playing on when there is a complete chain for one player or the other, as well as excludes legal positions for games longer than 43 ply.  Another researcher obtained a state space estimate of 10<sup>57</sup> and a game tree size of 10<sup>98</sup> using an upper limit of 50 plies for the game.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This compares to 10<sup>123</sup> node game tree size of chess.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nInteresting game tree reductions are available by noting that the board has dual bilateral symmetry as well as 180\u00b0 rotational symmetry: for each position, a topologically identical position is obtained by flipping the board left-right, top-bottom, or rotating it 180\u00b0.\n\n==Variants==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nOther connection games with similar objectives but different structures include [[Shannon switching game]] and [[TwixT]]. All of these games bear varying degrees of similarity to the ancient Asian game of [[Go (board game)|Go]].\n\n===Rectangular grids and paper and pencil===\nThe game may be played on a rectangular grid like a chess, checker or go board, by considering that spaces (intersections in the case of go) are connected in one diagonal direction but not the other. The game may be played with paper and pencil on a rectangular array of dots or graph paper in the same way by using two different colored pencils.\n\n=== Board sizes ===\nPopular dimensions other than the standard 11x11 are 13\u00d713 and 19\u00d719 as a result of the game's relationship to the older game of [[Go (board game)|Go]].  According to the book ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] (one of the game's inventors) advocated 14\u00d714 as the optimal size.\n\n=== [[Mis\u00e8re]] hex ===\nA variation has been described in which each player tries to force his opponent to make a chain.  This is a slow game.  A clever proof has been discovered that the first player can win on a board with an even number of cells per side, and the second player can win on a board with an odd number.<ref>Gardner (1959) p.78</ref><ref>Browne (2000) p.310</ref>\n\n===''Blockbusters''===\nHex had an incarnation as the question board from the television game show ''[[Blockbusters (U.S. game show)|Blockbusters]]''. In order to play a \"move\", contestants had to answer a question correctly. The board had 5 alternating columns of 4 hexagons; the solo player could connect top-to-bottom in 4 moves, while the team of two could connect left-to-right in 5 moves.\n\n===Y===\nThe [[Y (game)|game of Y]] is Hex played on a triangular grid of hexagons; the object is for either player to connect all three sides of the triangle.  Y is a generalization of Hex to the extent that any position on a Hex board can be represented as an equivalent position on a larger Y board.\n\n===Havannah===\n\n[[Havannah]] is a rather broadly defined variant of Hex played on a hexagonal grid of hexagons.  The objective is for either player to complete one of three characteristic patterns.\n\n=== Projex ===\nProjex is a variation of Hex played on a [[real projective plane]], where the players have the goal of creating a non[[contractible]] loop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31805/projex|title=Projex|website=BoardGameGeek|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref> Like in Hex, there are no ties, and there is no position in which both players have a winning connection.\n<!-- \n    please don't add arbitrary gamer variants from private websites to the list; see talk page for qualifying criteria.
