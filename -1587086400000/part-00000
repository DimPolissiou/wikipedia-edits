Many Americans did not expect Armada to do well, but he shocked the country by reaching the finals of the tournament, upsetting top American players such as Mew2King and Mang0. Armada would eventually lose in Grand Finals to Mang0, but Genesis established Armada as a legitimate contender for best in the world and was the start of a prolific rivalry between Armada and Mang0.<ref>[http://wiki.teamliquid.net/smash/GENESIS/1/Melee]. wiki.teamliquid.net (3 August 2017).

Two spots are awarded to participants in the High Performance Program (HPP), a National program that supports Top United States curlers, and is intended to prepare them for Olympic level play.  Two additional spots are given to the two highest ranked United States teams on the Curling order of Merit (that aren't already qualified via the HPP).  The remaining six positions are determined by the Challenge Round, open to all United States curlers, where the final six teams from this triple elimination tournament get spots in the National tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/USA-Curling/Events-Section/2019/January/02/Mens-Challenge-Round|title=Mens Challenge Round|website=Team USA|language=en|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe current format begins with a complete nine game [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] where each of the ten teams to play every other team. At the end of the round robin the top four teams qualify for the playoffs; if there is a tie for fourth place then a tiebreaker game is played. The playoffs are conducted in the [[Page playoff system|page playoff]] format, a common playoff format in curling. In a page playoff the 1 seed and 2 seed play with the winner advancing straight to the championship game. The 3 seed and 4 seed teams play and the winner of that match plays the loser of the 1 vs 2 game. The winner of this third game advances to the championship to face the winner of the 1 vs 2 game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org/-/media/USA_Curling/Images/Championships-1819/2019-Nationals/Media-Guide.pdf|title=2019 National Championship Media Guide|website=www.teamusa.org|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> \n\n==Past champions==\nThe location and champion of every men's national championship since it began in 1957:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Curling/Events/Championships-microsite/Inside-the-Championships/National-Championship-Events/National-Championships/National-Championships/Champions--and-Awards/Men|title=Men's Champions|website=www.teamusa.org|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!

After signing with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a [[free agent]] in 1995, Gagn\u00e9 began his career as a [[starting pitcher]]. After he struggled in that role, the Dodgers converted Gagn\u00e9 from a starter to a reliever, where for three years (2002\u20132004) he was statistically the most outstanding [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] in the game, winning the [[Cy Young Award]] in 2003. During that period, he set a major league record by converting 84 consecutive [[Save (baseball)|save]] opportunities. The phrase \"Game Over\" was heavily used by the Dodgers and the media in connection with his appearances to finish close games.\n\nGagn\u00e9 played sparingly in 2005 and 2006 due to injury, undergoing elbow surgery in 2005 and back surgery in 2006. The Dodgers did not re-sign him after 2006, and Gagn\u00e9 started the 2007 season with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], where he briefly enjoyed success again as a closer. However, he was less successful in stints with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and was finally released after the 2008 season.\n\nIn December 2007, days after signing a contract for 2008 with the Milwaukee Brewers, he was linked to baseball's steroids scandal after he was named in the [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|Mitchell Report]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nGagn\u00e9 comes from a [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] family and grew up in the town of [[Mascouche]], near [[Montreal]].<ref name=\"LL\">{{cite web|url=http://littleleague.org/media/eric_gagne.htm|title=\"Canadian Little League Graduate \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 Wins NL Cy Young Award\"|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416080030/http://www.littleleague.org/media/eric_gagne.htm|publisher=Little League Online|date=November 13, 2003|access-date=October 20, 2007|archive-date=April 16, 2007}}</ref> As a child, he played baseball and [[ice hockey]]<ref name=\"Gurnick\">Ken Gurnick, [http://www.baseball.ca/eng_news_story.cfm?NewsID=354 \"Batting Around with \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222348/http://www.baseball.ca/eng_news_story.cfm?NewsID=354 |date=September 27, 2007 }}, Baseball Canada, May 14, 2002.</ref> at Montreal's [[Polyvalente \u00c9douard-Montpetit High School]], the same high school that [[Russell Martin]] attended.\n\nHis Little League teams were coached by his father, Richard.<ref name=\"LL\" /> He eventually became a star with Canada's Junior World Championship teams.<ref>[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Gagne/Gagne_bio.html \"\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9\"], JockBio.com, 2003.</ref> He was a fan of the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] throughout his childhood.<ref name=\"NotOver\">{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Shaikin|title=Game (not) over for former Dodger Eric Gagne|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-shaikin5-2009jul05,0,4178092.story|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 5, 2009|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career===\nGagn\u00e9, who spoke only French, went to [[Seminole State College (Oklahoma)|Seminole Junior College]] in [[Seminole, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Gurnick\" /><ref name=\"scary\">Habib, Daniel G.

In his first year in the major leagues, he appeared in only five games as a starting pitcher, with a 1\u20131 record and 2.10 ERA.

He picked up his first career save on April 7 against the [[Colorado Rockies]] and soon became the [[National League]]'s leading reliever. He saved 10 consecutive games before he suffered his first blown save on May 7 against the [[Atlanta Braves]]. During that years All-Star Game he served up a two-run homer to Alfonso Soriano in the fifth, allowing the AL to cut the NL lead in half, to 4\u20132.  Overall, he earned 52 [[save (baseball)|saves]] for the season.\n\nIn 2003, as a [[closer (baseball)|closer]], Gagn\u00e9 was called upon 55 times to save a baseball game and converted every one of them en route to becoming both the first pitcher to record 50 saves in more than one season and also the fastest pitcher to ever reach the 100-save plateau. His 55 saves in 2003 also equalled the National League record set the previous season by [[John Smoltz]].

This translated into 1.66 strikeouts per inning pitched. For his performance, he won the [[Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award]] and became the first relief pitcher in 11 years to win the [[Cy Young Award]]. He and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] are the only two Canadian pitchers to win the most prestigious pitching award in baseball. He is the only pitcher to win the award while having a losing season (his record was 2\u20133).<ref>''Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records'', p.65, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, {{ISBN|978-1-55365-507-7}}</ref> As a result, in the off-season, during contract arbitration he asked for a 14-fold raise from $550,000 to $8&nbsp;million but had to settle for $5&nbsp;million, instead.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/nl/dodgers/2004-02-19-gagne-arbitration_x.htm \"Dodgers take Gagn\u00e9 deep\"], [[Associated Press]], February 19, 2004.</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2004\u2014just ten days after his saves streak ended\u2014Gagn\u00e9 collected his 130th save as a Dodger in a 5\u20132 win over the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] at [[Bank One Ballpark]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], surpassing Jeff Shaw for the most career saves in team history. Gagn\u00e9 threw three shutout innings during his first appearance in the playoffs that year, but the Dodgers lost the division series 3\u20131 to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\nPrior to the 2007 season, Gagn\u00e9 had converted 161 saves out of 168 save opportunities for a conversion rate of 95.8%.<ref name=\"starter\" />\n\n===Injuries===\nGagn\u00e9 battled several injuries in early 2005. Although he was still an effective pitcher, 2.70 ERA and 8 for 8 in save opportunities, Gagn\u00e9 was only able to appear in 14 games that season. On June 21, 2005, it was announced that Gagn\u00e9 would undergo season-ending [[Tommy John surgery]] to repair a sprained ligament in his right elbow. Recovery would take a year or more; furthermore, a return to major league pitching after a ''second'' Tommy John operation (Gagn\u00e9's first was in 1997) is nearly unheard of, having since been achieved by another Dodger reliever, the Taiwanese left-hander [[Hong-Chih Kuo]]. However, as surgeons began to perform the operation, they discovered instead a [[nerve]] entrapped by scar tissue and were able to release it with a less invasive procedure. Gagn\u00e9 was still unable to play for the remainder of the 2005 season.\n\nGagn\u00e9 expressed hope that an accelerated recovery would allow him to pitch for Canada in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|World Baseball Classic]] in March 2006, but he eventually decided that it was not worth the risk, and to focus on preparing to pitch in the regular season.\n\nAfter some encouraging outings in early [[spring training]], pain in Gagn\u00e9's pitching elbow forced him to undergo a second surgery, this time to remove entirely the nerve that doctors had previously attempted to stabilize. More recovery time ensued, but Gagn\u00e9 finally pitched in his first regular-season game of 2006 on June 3. He made two appearances for the Dodgers, pitching two scoreless innings and earning one save, but pain from the nerve in his elbow recurred, and he returned to the [[disabled list]] on June 12. A further (and apparently unrelated) setback occurred on July 4, when Gagn\u00e9 awoke with intense pain in his back. An examination revealed two [[spinal disc herniation|herniated discs]], and Gagn\u00e9 underwent a season-ending back surgery on July 8.<ref name=\"Gagne.surgery\">{{cite news|authorlink=Ken Gurnick|title=Gagne to Have Surgery, Done for Season|url=http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/emailArticleServlet?aid=1046630|publisher=MLB|date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=December 18, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n===Texas Rangers===\n[[File:Gagne.jpg|thumb|upright|\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in [[2007 Texas Rangers season|2007]].]]\nThe Dodgers declined to extend Gagn\u00e9's $12&nbsp;million contract after the season, making him a [[free agent]].<ref name=\"signed\" /> On December 12, 2006 Gagn\u00e9 signed a one-year deal with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] worth $6&nbsp;million, with a possible $5&nbsp;million in performance bonuses.

After a few days, Gagn\u00e9 indicated he was ready to return to his role as closer, and a couple of days later, got his 10th save. However, Gagn\u00e9 continued to struggle as the team's closer and ultimately became the set-up man after losing his closer job to the veteran [[Salom\u00f3n Torres]]. Gagn\u00e9's struggles continued out of the bullpen, however, and he eventually lost his set-up job to [[Guillermo Mota]].

Overall, he earned 52 [[save (baseball)|saves]] for the season.\n\nIn 2003, as a [[closer (baseball)|closer]], Gagn\u00e9 was called upon 55 times to save a baseball game and converted every one of them en route to becoming both the first pitcher to record 50 saves in more than one season and also the fastest pitcher to ever reach the 100-save plateau. His 55 saves in 2003 also equalled the National League record set the previous season by [[John Smoltz]]. Between August 26, 2002 and July 5, 2004, he converted 84 consecutive save chances, a major league record.<ref name=\"record\">{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Gagne agrees to $6M deal with Rangers|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2695054|publisher=ESPN|date=December 12, 2006|accessdate=July 1, 2007}}</ref> More than half (55%) of the batters he retired during the 2003 season came by [[strikeout]].\n\nWhen Gagn\u00e9 entered a game at [[Dodger Stadium]], usually in the eighth or ninth inning with the Dodgers in the lead, the words \"Game Over\" would flash across the scoreboard and the PA system would play the song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\" by [[Guns N' Roses]].\n\nIn addition to his 55 saves, Gagn\u00e9 finished the 2003 season with a 1.20 [[earned run average]] and had 137 strikeouts and 20 [[Base on balls|walks]] in 82\u2153 innings pitched. This translated into 1.66 strikeouts per inning pitched. For his performance, he won the [[Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award]] and became the first relief pitcher in 11 years to win the [[Cy Young Award]]. He and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] are the only two Canadian pitchers to win the most prestigious pitching award in baseball.

Gagn\u00e9 threw three shutout innings during his first appearance in the playoffs that year, but the Dodgers lost the division series 3\u20131 to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\nPrior to the 2007 season, Gagn\u00e9 had converted 161 saves out of 168 save opportunities for a conversion rate of 95.8%.<ref name=\"starter\" />\n\n===Injuries===\nGagn\u00e9 battled several injuries in early 2005. Although he was still an effective pitcher, 2.70 ERA and 8 for 8 in save opportunities, Gagn\u00e9 was only able to appear in 14 games that season. On June 21, 2005, it was announced that Gagn\u00e9 would undergo season-ending [[Tommy John surgery]] to repair a sprained ligament in his right elbow. Recovery would take a year or more; furthermore, a return to major league pitching after a ''second'' Tommy John operation (Gagn\u00e9's first was in 1997) is nearly unheard of, having since been achieved by another Dodger reliever, the Taiwanese left-hander [[Hong-Chih Kuo]]. However, as surgeons began to perform the operation, they discovered instead a [[nerve]] entrapped by scar tissue and were able to release it with a less invasive procedure. Gagn\u00e9 was still unable to play for the remainder of the 2005 season.\n\nGagn\u00e9 expressed hope that an accelerated recovery would allow him to pitch for Canada in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic|World Baseball Classic]] in March 2006, but he eventually decided that it was not worth the risk, and to focus on preparing to pitch in the regular season.\n\nAfter some encouraging outings in early [[spring training]], pain in Gagn\u00e9's pitching elbow forced him to undergo a second surgery, this time to remove entirely the nerve that doctors had previously attempted to stabilize. More recovery time ensued, but Gagn\u00e9 finally pitched in his first regular-season game of 2006 on June 3. He made two appearances for the Dodgers, pitching two scoreless innings and earning one save, but pain from the nerve in his elbow recurred, and he returned to the [[disabled list]] on June 12. A further (and apparently unrelated) setback occurred on July 4, when Gagn\u00e9 awoke with intense pain in his back. An examination revealed two [[spinal disc herniation|herniated discs]], and Gagn\u00e9 underwent a season-ending back surgery on July 8.<ref name=\"Gagne.surgery\">{{cite news|authorlink=Ken Gurnick|title=Gagne to Have Surgery, Done for Season|url=http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/emailArticleServlet?aid=1046630|publisher=MLB|date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=December 18, 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n===Texas Rangers===\n[[File:Gagne.jpg|thumb|upright|\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in [[2007 Texas Rangers season|2007]].]]\nThe Dodgers declined to extend Gagn\u00e9's $12&nbsp;million contract after the season, making him a [[free agent]].<ref name=\"signed\" /> On December 12, 2006 Gagn\u00e9 signed a one-year deal with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] worth $6&nbsp;million, with a possible $5&nbsp;million in performance bonuses.
