{"title_page": "Beno\u00eet Clair", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date= October 2009}}\n{{BLP sources|date=October 2009}}\n}}\n\n'''Benoit Clair''' (born 1953) is a French [[journalist]] and a published [[author]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter studying [[journalism]], sciences politiques and [[law]] in University in [[Paris]] and [[Tours]] (France), Benoit Clair began his career as the French Parliament liaison for Remy Montagne, who was deputy of the 3rd district of [[Louviers]], in the [[Eure]] area. In 1974, Clair was a correspondent for French media like [[Radio France]] and [[Europe 1]]. He was one of the first French journalists to cover the war in [[Lebanon]] (1974\u20131975), with Gabriel Dardaud. Founder of the free radio Paris FM in 1981, which three years later became a subsidiary of Europe 1, Clair was appointed its co-director together with Robert Namias. Located in the [[Montparnasse Tower]], Paris FM later changed its name to 95.2 FM, then Fun Radio Group, which is still in business.\n\nIn 1985, the prestigious French publication ''[[Paris Match]]'' delegated Clair as special envoy to the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], to observe the training of two CNES French spacemen, members of the first Franco-American shuttle crew. A senior writer for ''Paris Match'', Benoit was the first journalist allowed to join the shuttle crew members. He accompanied them 24 hours a day, for the entire training period until their departure for the launch pad at [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]]. A series of reports on the training was published in ''Paris Match'' in 1985 and 1986. ''Paris Match'' sold more than one million copies worldwide covering this major event. Benoit's first book, ''Aujourd'hui le soleil se l\u00e8ve 16 fois'' (''Today, the Sun Rises 16 Times''), was the outcome of this assignment and was published in September 1985 by Carr\u00e8re-Lafon. The book covers the space trip of [[Patrick Baudry]], French payload specialist aboard [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle Discovery]] mission STS-51-G. The book was followed by an audio CD produced by CBS France in January 1986. The series features the narration of the space trip, written by Clair, with voice-over by Michel Chevalet from TF1.\n\nLater, Clair was hired by [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] as head of Communication of their [[Ariane 5]]-Herm\u00e8s [[space program]]. In 1988, Benoit was appointed communications advisor for the political campaign of [[Raymond Barre]], [[presidential election|presidential]] candidate. After the election, he was retained as director of communication and marketing for Europe by the American group [[AlliedSignal]]/[[Bendix Corporation]], headquartered in [[Morristown, New Jersey]].\n\nClair moved to the [[United States]] in 1991, as communication consultant and accredited journalist correspondent of French media entities like ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Prisma-Presse group (''[[VSD (French magazine)|VSD]]'') and [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]]. He was the permanent correspondent of [[Radio Monte Carlo]] from 1995 to 2007. During his tenure at RMC, he was the producer and host of a daily hit broadcast show, live from [[Hollywood, California]]. The show lasted from 1996 to 2000. In 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012, Clair covered the [[2004 United States presidential election|US Presidential Elections]] for different French media, like TV5 and published, in 2004, a second book about Senator [[John Kerry]]'s campaign. The book was ''John F. Kerry targets the White House''; [[Pierre Salinger]], the former press secretary of President [[John F. Kennedy]], wrote the foreword. In 2005, Clair co-wrote the script, produced and directed the film ''The Truth about Black Dahlia'', commissioned by [[NBC Universal]] for French TV sub-channel 13\u00e8me rue using new [[digital cinematography]] cameras, i.e., the RedOne camera from the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company. Clair is currently Senior Correspondent for several french and european media-companies and associate-producer for a series of TV and high profile [[HDTV]] news and documentary videos. In April 2016, he was named Chairman of the Board of BCF & Partners, an international capital venture firm based in Geneva (Switzerland), with major investments in new technologies, news and digital media.\n\n==Films and writings==\n* ''The Dream is alive'' (''Le r\u00eave est vivant''), 1986: Screenplay and voice-over, IMAX Canada \u2013 USA \u2013 Japon \u2013 France (La G\u00e9ode)\n* \"Waiting for Herm\u00e8s\" (\"En attendant Herm\u00e8s\") and \"Children of the mine\", (\"Les enfants de la mine\"), 1998: Special Envoy to Peru TV station FRANCE 2\n* ''Information Mercenaries'' (''Les mercenaires de l'Info''), 52 min.: Screenplay TF1 Prime News\n* ''The Truth about Black Dahlia'' (''La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Dahlia noir''), 52 min., 2007: Screenplay and Director, NBC Universal and 13\u00e8me Rue TV (Paris)\n* Several other contributions for entities such as TV5MONDE, LCI TV (TF1), LCP-Assembl\u00e9e Nationale\n* ''Today, the Sun rises 16 Times'' (''Aujourd'hui le soleil se l\u00e8ve 16 fois''), publisher Carr\u00e8re-Lafon, Paris.\n* ''John F.

It is operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n==History==\nThe beginnings (1986\u20131997)\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled Opportunities in Chemistry. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n===The early years (1997\u20132001)===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n===A maturing program (2001\u20132009)===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world.

It is operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.\n[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|thumb|left|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n==History==\nThe beginnings (1986\u20131997)\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled Opportunities in Chemistry. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n===The early years (1997\u20132001)===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n===A maturing program (2001\u20132009)===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultrasensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n===Building for the future (2009 to present)===\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package, NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students.

For the Royalists, this meant fortifying their new capital in [[Oxford]], and connecting areas of support in England and Wales; Parliament focused on consolidating control of the areas they already held.

Hurry's information revealed Essex had concentrated his troops in the north, to protect the convoy, leaving his southern positions exposed.

Having inflicted 50 casualties, as well as capturing prisoners and stores, Prince Rupert decided to withdraw before his line of retreat was cut; by 6:30 am, his forces were on the road back to Oxford.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=229}} \n\nWhile three troops under Hampden and Major John Gunter maintained contact with the Royalists, the local commander at [[Thame]], Sir [[Philip Stapleton]], hastily pulled together a force to attack them. Several senior officers, supposedly in Thame to collect their regiments' wages, helped him form a number of [[ad hoc]] units; having collected around 700 men, Stapleton set out in pursuit.{{sfn|Lester|Lester|2015|p=34}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:The Bridleway to Chalgrove - geograph.org.uk - 93360.jpg|thumb|right|Route taken by the Royalist infantry along the bridleway from Golder Hill to [[Easington, South Oxfordshire|Easington]]]]\nWith Sir Henry Lunsford's infantry leading the way, the Royalists made slow progress due to their prisoners and loot, with their column spread out along two miles. By 8:30 am, the rearguard was in contact with Hampden and Gunter, who had been joined by 100 dragoons under [[John_Dalbier|Colonel Dalbier]], an experienced German mercenary. Realising he could not outrun his pursuers, Rupert ordered Lunsford to keep moving, and secure the bridge at [[Chiselhampton]].{{sfn|Stevenson|Carter|1973|p=348}} \n\nThis took them along a bridleway, bounded by a \u2018Great Hedge\u2019, a double line of thick, shoulder-high hedgerows that could not be flanked. [[Thomas_Wentworth,_5th_Baron_Wentworth|Lord Wentworth]]'s dragoons set up an ambush further along the hedgerow (see Map), while Rupert's cavalry formed up in an open field. By now, the Parliamentary forces consisted of around 200 cavalry, plus the dragoons.{{sfn|Stevenson|Carter|1973|p=349}}\n\nDalbier moved his dragoons up to the hedge, and opened fire on the Royalist cavalry; this prompted Prince Rupert into an attack, allegedly leaping the hedge while the rest of his men made their way around. Dalbier withdrew, reinforced by Hampden and Gunter; the Parliamentary troops initially held their ground, but were heavily outnumbered, and broke. For once, Rupert's men halted their pursuit, probably since their horses were exhausted, and withdrew to Chiselhampton, where they remained until the next day.{{sfn|Stevenson|Carter|1973|pp=351-353}}   \n[[File:Chalgrove Battle Map.png|thumb|left|Chalgrove Battle Map]]\nMost accounts indicate that by the time Stapleton arrived, the fighting was largely over, although it has been suggested otherwise, primarily by Royalist statesman and historian, the [[Edward_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]].{{sfn|Clarendon|1704|pp=262-263}} The claim that Parliamentary casualties contained a disproportionate number of senior officers also originated with Clarendon.{{sfn|Historic England|2020}}\n   \nCasualty figures are unclear, partly because contemporary reports often fail to distinguish between those incurred at Chinnor, the skirmish with the rearguard, and the battle itself. The Royalists reported a total of 45 for both sides, Essex suggested 50 each, including Gunter, who was killed close to the hedge, and Hampden. Shot twice in the shoulder, the wound became infected, and he died six days later. Later claims that his injuries were caused by the explosion of his own pistol have not been substantiated.{{sfn|Lester|Blackshaw|2000|pp=21-24}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn February, [[Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed in [[Bridlington|Bridlington, Yorkshire]] with an arms consignment from the [[Dutch Republic]]. By mid-June, the convoy was at [[Newark-on-Trent]]; Chalgrove ended any hopes of an interception, and it entered Oxford in early July. More importantly, the Royalists established a psychological edge over their opponents, confirmed on 25 June when Hurry attacked [[High_Wycombe|Wycombe]]. Essex withdrew from [[Oxfordshire]], allowing Prince Rupert to support operations in the west, culminating in the [[Storming_of_Bristol|capture of Bristol]] on 26 July.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=233-234}}\n\nArguably the greatest loss was that of Hampden; his close friend [[Anthony Nicholl]] wrote; \u2018Never Kingdom received a greater loss in one subject, never a man a truer and more faithful friend.\u2019{{sfn|Adair|1979|p=17}} His reputation for honesty and patriotism, and man management skills, had been vital in minimising internal divisions, particularly after the exposure of [[Edmund_Waller#'Waller's_Plot'|Edmund Waller's Plot]] on 31 May, with his links to many Parliamentary leaders, including Essex.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=219}} [[John Pym]]'s death in December meant the two most prominent leaders of the pre-war opposition disappeared from the scene in less than six months, in a period that proved the highpoint of Royalist success.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|p=278}}\n\nFollowing an extensive debate over whether it constituted a 'battle' or 'skirmish', [[English Heritage]] designated it a [[Registered Battlefields (UK)|registered battlefield]] in 1995.{{sfn|Historic England 1000006}} In 1843, [[George_Nugent-Grenville,_2nd_Baron_Nugent|George Nugent-Grenville]], a [[Radical_Whigs|Whig radical]] politician and author of the hagiographic ''Memorials of John Hampden'', paid for the Hampden Monument, located 700 metres south of the main site.{{sfn|Historic England 1059742}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{cite journal |last1=Adair |first1=John |title=The Death of John Hampden |journal=History Today |date=1979 |volume=29 |issue=10 |ref=harv}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Clarendon |first1=Earl of |title=The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England;

It was fought near the villages of [[Kingston, Rhode Island|Kingston]] and [[West Kingston, Rhode Island|West Kingston]] in the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. The combined force of the New England militia included 150 [[Pequot]]s, and they inflicted a huge number of Narragansett casualties, including many hundred women and children. The battle has been described as \"one of the most brutal and lopsided military encounters in all of New England's history.\"<ref name=\"Drake\" /> Since the 1930s, Narragansett and Wampanoag people commemorate the battle annually in a ceremony initiated by Narragansett-Wampanoag scholar [[Princess Red Wing]].\n\n==Historical context==\nThe Pokanoket Indians had helped the original pilgrim settlers to survive,<ref>Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick</ref> under the leadership of [[Massasoit]]. His sons Wamsutta and Metacom took on the English names of Alexander and Philip, respectively. Alexander became [[sachem]] of the Pokanokets on the death of his father, but he died within a year and Philip succeeded him in 1662.\n\nPhilip began laying plans to attack the colonists in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and he slowly built a confederation of neighboring Indian tribes. He also gathered muskets and gunpowder for the eventual attack, but only in small numbers in order that the colonists would not be alarmed.<ref>http://burnpit.us/2012/12/great-swamp-fight-colonial-militia-assault-indian-stronghold</ref>\n\nSeveral Wampanoag men attacked and killed colonists in [[Swansea, Massachusetts]], on June 20, 1675, and that began King Philip's War.  The Indians laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people. A full eclipse of the moon occurred in the New England area on June 27, 1675 (O.S.) (July 7, 1675 N.S.; See [[Old Style and New Style dates]]),<ref>Moon Eclipse calculation [http://www.hermit.org/Eclipse/gen_stats.cgi] Accessed December 22, 2011</ref> and various tribes looked at it as a good omen for attacking the colonists.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward; ''Flintlock and Tomahawk''; p. 46; Parnassus Imprints, East Orleans, Massachusetts; 1954; {{ISBN|0-940160-55-2}}</ref> Officials from the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies responded quickly to the attacks on Swansea; on June 28, they sent a punitive military expedition which destroyed the Wampanoag town at [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope]] in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].\n\nThe Indians waged attacks on settlements in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but Rhode Island was spared at the beginning, as the Narragansetts remained officially neutral.<ref>http://minerdescent.com/2011/11/19/great-swamp-fight/</ref>  In October, the Indians struck again with raids on the towns of Hatfield, Northampton, and Springfield, where almost the entire settlement [[Attack on Springfield|was burned to the ground]]. As winter set in, the attacks diminished.\n\nOn November 2, 1675, [[Josiah Winslow]] led a combined force of over 1,000 colonial militia, including about 150 [[Pequot]] and [[Mohegan]] Indians, against the Narragansetts living around [[Narragansett Bay]]. The Narragansett tribe had not yet been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of King Philip's men, women, and children, and several of their warriors had participated in Indian raiding parties.<ref>David Lindsay, PhD., Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (St. Martins Press, New York, 2002) p. 205-206</ref> The colonists distrusted the Narragansetts and feared that the tribe would join King Philip's cause in the spring, which caused great concern due to the tribe's location. The militia burned several abandoned Narragansett villages as they marched around [[Narragansett Bay]], as the tribe had retreated to a large fort in the center of the Great Swamp near [[Kingston, Rhode Island]].\n[[Image:King Philip C by Revere.jpg|thumb|\"Philip.

Alexander became [[sachem]] of the Pokanokets on the death of his father, but he died within a year and Philip succeeded him in 1662.\n\nPhilip began laying plans to attack the colonists in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and he slowly built a confederation of neighboring Indian tribes. He also gathered muskets and gunpowder for the eventual attack, but only in small numbers in order that the colonists would not be alarmed.<ref>http://burnpit.us/2012/12/great-swamp-fight-colonial-militia-assault-indian-stronghold</ref>\n\nSeveral Wampanoag men attacked and killed colonists in [[Swansea, Massachusetts]] on June 20, 1675, and that began King Philip's War.  The Indians laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people. A full eclipse of the moon occurred in the New England area on June 27, 1675 (O.S.) (July 7, 1675 N.S.; See [[Old Style and New Style dates]]),<ref>Moon Eclipse calculation [http://www.hermit.org/Eclipse/gen_stats.cgi] Accessed December 22, 2011</ref> and various tribes looked at it as a good omen for attacking the colonists.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward; ''Flintlock and Tomahawk''; p. 46; Parnassus Imprints, East Orleans, Massachusetts; 1954; {{ISBN|0-940160-55-2}}</ref> Officials from the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies responded quickly to the attacks on Swansea; on June 28, they sent a punitive military expedition which destroyed the Wampanoag town at [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope]] in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]].\n\nThe Indians waged attacks on settlements in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but Rhode Island was spared at the beginning, as the Narragansetts remained officially neutral.<ref>http://minerdescent.com/2011/11/19/great-swamp-fight/</ref>  In October, the Indians struck again with raids on the towns of Hatfield, Northampton, and Springfield, where almost the entire settlement [[Attack on Springfield|was burned to the ground]]. As winter set in, the attacks diminished.\n\nOn November 2, 1675, [[Josiah Winslow]] led a combined force of over 1,000 colonial militia, including about 150 [[Pequot]] and [[Mohegan]] Indians, against the Narragansetts living around [[Narragansett Bay]]. The Narragansett tribe had not yet been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of King Philip's men, women, and children, and several of their warriors had participated in Indian raiding parties.<ref>David Lindsay, PhD., Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (St. Martins Press, New York, 2002) p. 205-206</ref> The colonists distrusted the Narragansetts and feared that the tribe would join King Philip's cause in the spring, which caused great concern due to the tribe's location. The militia burned several abandoned Narragansett villages as they marched around [[Narragansett Bay]], as the tribe had retreated to a large fort in the center of the Great Swamp near [[Kingston, Rhode Island]].\n[[Image:King Philip C by Revere.jpg|thumb|\"Philip.

Records indicate that Joshua Tefft wounded Captain Nathaniel Seely of Connecticut (son of Captain [[Robert Seeley]]), who subsequently died. An Indian spy reported that Tefft \"did them good service & killed & wounded 5 or 6 English in that fight & before they would trust him he had killed a miller an English man at Narragansett and brought his scalpe to them.\" <ref>http://www.westernrihistory.org/uploads/6/5/0/9/6509445/western_ri_newsletter_8-11.pdf{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n\nOn December 15, 1675, Narraganset warriors attacked the [[Jireh Bull Blockhouse]] and killed at least 15 people.  15 year-old James Eldred escaped from the blockhouse and was pursued a considerable distance; he survived having a tomahawk thrown at him at close range and a hand-to-hand encounter with a Narraganset warrior.  This occurred along Indian Run Brook in [[Wakefield-Peacedale, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rebelpuritan.blogspot.com/2012/01/great-swamp-fight-of-1675.html|title=The Great Swamp Fight |publisher=The Rebel Puritan|author=Jo Anne Butler|accessdate=15 Oct 2017}}</ref>\n\nFour days later, the Great Swamp Battle took place on the bitterly cold and stormy day of December 19, 1675. The colonial militia from [[Plymouth Colony]], [[Connecticut Colony]], and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were led to the main Narragansett settlement in South Kingstown, Rhode Island by an Indian guide named Indian Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigelowsociety.com/rod/battles.htm |title=Letter of John Dudley, Narragansett Campaign and the Great Swamp Fight|date=15 Dec 1675|accessdate=15 Oct 2017}}</ref>  The massive fort occupied about {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land and was initially occupied by over a thousand people, but it was eventually overrun after a fierce fight. The settlement was burned, its inhabitants (including women and children) killed or evicted, and most of the tribe's winter stores destroyed. It is believed that at least 97 Narragansett warriors and 300 to 1,000 non-combatants were killed, though exact figures are unknown.<ref name=\"Drake\" />\n\n[[File:CaptureOfKingPhillipsFort.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Engraving depicting the colonial assault on the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts']] fort in the Great Swamp Fight in December 1675]]\n\nMany of the warriors and their families escaped into the frozen swamp; hundreds more died there from wounds combined with the harsh conditions. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault, and about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded. The dead and wounded militiamen were evacuated to the settlements on [[Aquidneck Island]] in [[Narragansett Bay]] where they were buried or cared for by many of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] colonists.<ref>Axelrod, p. 104</ref> \n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Benjamin Church'', the first [[United States Army Ranger|American ranger]].'']]\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Great Swamp Fight was a critical blow to the Narragansett tribe from which they never fully recovered.<ref>\"Flintlock and Tomahawk--New England in King Philip's War\" by Douglas Edward Leach,  New York: MacMillan, 1958, pg. 130-132</ref> The Narragansetts were completely defeated when their chief sachem [[Canonchet]] was captured and executed in April 1676, then female sachem Queen Quaiapen drowned on July 2 attempting to cross a river.

For instance there has been significant controversy surrounding the closings of Case 003 and Case 004. Many international critics say these closings stem from a reluctance by the Cambodian government to try Khmer Rouge officials who managed to switch alliances towards the end of the conflict.\n\nFurthermore, the ECCC has been criticized for its general stagnancy in relation to its finances. In financing the tribunal, the Cambodian government and the United Nations are both responsible for managing the cost of operations of the ECCC. Between 2006 and 2012, $173.3 million were spent on the ECCC. Out of the $173.3 million, Cambodia has contributed $42.1 million, while the United Nations has donated the other $131.2 million. For the year 2013, Cambodia has a budget of $9.4 million to spend, while the United Nations has $26 million, making the total budget for that year $35.4 million.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, as of 2014, the ECCC had cost over $200,000,000, in which, at that point, only one case has been completed.<ref name=time>{{cite journal| title=Cambodia\u2019s Khmer Rouge Trials Are a Shocking Failure| url=http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/704348-time-cambodias-khmer-rouge-trials-are-a-shocking-failure/| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=14 February 2014| last=Campbell| first=Charlie| accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> Many in the international committee demand an outside committee to review the failures of the ECCC thus far.

A victim applying to participate in Case 003 was rejected because the judges claimed her psychological harm to be \"highly unlikely to be true\" and through a narrow definition of \"direct victim\", determined her an indirect victim in the case.  The Open Society Justice Initiative calls for the UN to investigate the proceedings of the ECCC.

The OCP is headed by the Cambodian National Co-Prosecutor (appointed by the Supreme Council of the Magistracy of Cambodia) and the International Co-Prosecutor (nominated by the United Nations Secretary-General), serving as co-prosecutors. The role of the OCP is to prosecute the senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge and others most responsible for the crimes committed during the period of Democratic Kampuchea. The OCP is responsible for the prosecution of cases throughout the investigative, pre-trial, trial and appellate stages. The OCP processes victim complaints; conducts the preliminary investigations (first investigatory stage); and issues Introductory Submissions to the Office of Co-Investigating Judges where there is sufficient evidence of crimes within the jurisdiction of the ECCC having been committed. Introductory Submissions set out the facts, applicable law, alleged offences, and person(s) to be investigated.

In financing the tribunal, the Cambodian government and the United Nations are both responsible for managing the cost of operations of the ECCC. Between 2006 and 2012, $173.3 million were spent on the ECCC. Out of the $173.3 million, Cambodia has contributed $42.1 million, while the United Nations has donated the other $131.2 million.

A victim applying to participate in Case 003 was rejected because the judges claimed her psychological harm to be \"highly unlikely to be true\" and through a narrow definition of \"direct victim\", determined her an indirect victim in the case.
