It is based on the 1812 novel ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' by [[Johann David Wyss]] and is the first feature-length film version of the story.\n\n==Plot==\nIn London in 1813, a Swiss father, William Robinson, wishes to escape the influence of the superficial profligacy of London on his family. His eldest son, Fritz, is obsessed with [[Napoleon]], whom he considers his hero. His middle son, Jack, is a foolish dandy who cares only about fashion and money. And his dreamy son Ernest is preoccupied with reading and writing to the exclusion of all else.\n\nWilliam Robinson sells his business and house, in order to move with his wife and four sons to Australia. They set out on a [[brig]] bound for the faraway country. Following a long voyage, the family is shipwrecked on a remote deserted island after the captain and crew are washed overboard during a storm.\n\nThe family members collaborate to create a home for themselves in the alien jungle environment. They gradually learn to use the unfamiliar plants and animals to create what they need to live and thrive. They have many adventures and challenges and make many discoveries. The mother, however, misses her elegant home and community in England, and wishes to somehow be rescued and return. The father slowly convinces her that living in the natural environment is better for the family and that they are meant to be there.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as William Robinson\n*[[Edna Best]] as Elizabeth Robinson\n*[[Freddie Bartholomew]] as Jack Robinson\n*[[Terry Kilburn]] as Ernest Robinson\n*[[Tim Holt]] as Fritz Robinson\n*Bobbie Quillan as Francis Robinson (credited as Baby Bobby Quillan)\n*[[Christian Rub]] as Thoren\n*[[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]] as Ramsey\n*[[Herbert Rawlinson]] as Captain\n*[[Orson Welles]] as Narrator (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe producers specialised in making films based on public domain texts.<ref>THE AGELESS ROBINSONS\nNew York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 04 Feb 1940: 122.</ref>\n\n[[Tim Holt]] was the first star assigned.<ref>DRAMA: Glamour Cast Named for 'Ziegfeld Girl'\nSchallert, Edwin.

These escape routes mainly led toward havens in [[Latin America]], particularly [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Colombia]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Colombia Nazi|url=http://www.semana.com/enfoque/articulo/colombia-nazi/8142-3|accessdate=14 November 2016|publisher=Semana}}</ref> [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Bolivia]], as well as the United States, Spain and [[Switzerland]]. \n\nThere were two primary routes: the first went from [[Germany]] to [[Spain]], then Argentina; the second from Germany to [[Rome]] to [[Genoa]], then [[South America]]. The two routes developed independently but eventually came together.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=173}} The ratlines were supported by clergy of the [[Catholic Church]], and historian [[Michael Phayer]] claims this was supported by [[the Holy See|the Vatican]].{{sfn|Phayer|2008|pp=220, 222}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rittner |first1=Carol |last2=Roth |first2=John K. |title=Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust |date=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9781474281560 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UR3mDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhile Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]] is unanimously considered by reputable scholars to have [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide in Berlin]] near the end of the war, various [[Conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler's death|conspiracy theories claim that he survived]] the war and fled to Argentina.\n\n==Early Spanish ratlines==\nThe origins of the first ratlines are connected to various developments in [[Vatican City|Vatican]]-Argentine relations before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Phayer|2008|pp=173\u201379}} As early as 1942, Monsignor [[Luigi Maglione]] contacted Ambassador Llobet, inquiring as to the \"willingness of the government of the Argentine Republic to apply its immigration law generously, in order to encourage at the opportune moment European [[Catholicism|Catholic]] immigrants to seek the necessary land and capital in our country\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=179}} Afterwards, a German priest, Anton Weber, the head of the Rome-based Society of Saint Raphael, traveled to [[Portugal]], continuing to Argentina, to lay the groundwork for future Catholic immigration; this was to be a route which fascist exiles would exploit. According to historian [[Michael Phayer]], \"this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=179}}\n\nSpain, not Rome, was the \"first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists,\" although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=180}} Among the primary organizers were [[Charles Lescat]], a French member of [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]] &ndash; an organization suppressed by [[Pope Pius XI]] and rehabilitated by [[Pope Pius XII]] &ndash; and [[Pierre Daye]], a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=182}} Lescat and Daye were the first to flee Europe with the help of Argentine cardinal [[Antonio Caggiano]].{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=182}}\n\nBy 1946, there were hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=183}} According to then-[[United States Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], Vatican cooperation in turning over these \"asylum-seekers\" was \"negligible\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=183}} According to Phayer, Pius XII \"preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camps in zonal Germany\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=187}} Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy that centered on [[Vatican City]], the ratlines of Spain, although \"fostered by the Vatican,\" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=188}}\n\n==Roman ratlines==\n===Early efforts: Bishop Hudal===\nAustrian Catholic bishop [[Alois Hudal]], a Nazi sympathiser, was rector of the [[Pontificio Istituto Teutonico Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in [[Rome]], a seminary for [[Austria]]n and [[Germany|German]] priests, and \"Spiritual Director of the German People resident in Italy\".<ref>{{harv|Aarons|Loftus|1998|p=36}}</ref> After the end of the war in Italy, Hudal became active in ministering to German-speaking [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and internees then held in camps throughout Italy. In December 1944, the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] [[Vatican Secretariat of State|Secretariat of State]] received permission to appoint a representative to \"visit the German-speaking civil internees in Italy\", a job assigned to Hudal.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nHudal used this position to aid the escape of wanted Nazi [[war crime|war criminals]], including [[Franz Stangl]], commanding officer of [[Treblinka]], [[Gustav Wagner (SS officer)|Gustav Wagner]], commanding officer of [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Alois Brunner]], responsible for the [[Drancy internment camp]] near Paris and in charge of deportations in Slovakia to German [[concentration camp]]s, and [[Adolf Eichmann]]{{sfn|Phayer|2000|p=11}}\u2014a fact about which he was later unashamedly open. Some of these wanted men were being held in internment camps: generally without identity papers, they would be enrolled in camp registers under false names. Other Nazis hid in Italy and sought Hudal out as his role in assisting escapes became known on the Nazi grapevine.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=289}}\n\nIn his memoirs, Hudal said of his actions, \"I thank God that He [allowed me] to visit and comfort many victims in their prisons and concentration camps and to help them escape with false identity papers.\"<ref>Hudal, ''R\u00f6mische Tageb\u00fccher'' {{harv|Aarons|Loftus|1998|p=37}}</ref> He explained that in his eyes:\n\n<blockquote>The Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting. This so-called business ... used catchwords like democracy, race, religious liberty and Christianity as a bait for the masses. All these experiences were the reason why I felt duty bound after 1945 to devote my whole charitable work mainly to former National Socialists and Fascists, especially to so-called 'war criminals'.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Mark Aarons]] and [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] in their book ''Unholy Trinity'', Hudal was the first Catholic priest to dedicate himself to establishing escape routes.{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|loc=ch. 2}} Aarons and Loftus claim that Hudal provided the objects of his charity with money to help them escape and, more importantly, provided them with false papers, including identity documents issued by the Vatican Refugee Organisation (''[[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]]''). These Vatican papers were not full passports and thus were not enough to gain passage overseas. They were, rather, the first stop in a paper trail\u2014they could be used to obtain a displaced person passport from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), which in turn could be used to apply for visas. In theory, the ICRC would perform background checks on passport applicants, but in practice the word of a priest or particularly a bishop would be good enough. According to statements collected by Austrian writer [[Gitta Sereny]] from a senior official of the Rome branch of the ICRC,{{sfn|Sereny|1983|pp=316\u201317}} Hudal could also use his position as a bishop to request papers from the ICRC \"made out according to his specifications\". Sereny's sources also revealed an active illicit trade in stolen and forged ICRC papers in Rome at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAccording to declassified U.S. intelligence reports, Hudal was not the only priest helping Nazi escapees at this time. In the \"La Vista Report\" declassified in 1984, [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) operative Vincent La Vista told how he had easily arranged for two bogus Hungarian refugees to get false ICRC documents with the help of a letter from a Father Joseph Gallov. Gallov, who ran a Vatican-sponsored charity for Hungarian refugees, asked no questions and wrote a letter to his \"personal contact in the International Red Cross, who then issued the passports\".{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|pp=43\u201345}}\n\n===San Girolamo ratline===\nAccording to Aarons and Loftus, Hudal's private operation was small scale compared to what came later. The major Roman ratline was operated by a small, but influential network of [[Croatia]]n priests, members of the [[Franciscan]] order, led by Father [[Krunoslav Draganovi\u0107]], who organized a highly sophisticated chain with headquarters at the [[San Girolamo degli Illirici]] Seminary College in Rome, but with links from Austria to the final embarcation point at the port of [[Genoa]]. The ratline initially focused on aiding members of the Croatian [[Usta\u0161e]] including its leader (or [[Poglavnik]]), [[Ante Paveli\u0107]].{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|loc=ch. 5}}\n\nPriests active in the chain included: Fr. Vilim Cecelja, former Deputy Military Vicar to the [[Usta\u0161e]], based in [[Austria]] where many Ustashe and Nazi refugees remained in hiding; Fr. Dragutin Kamber, based at San Girolamo; Fr. [[Dominik Mandi\u0107]], an official [[Holy See|Vatican]] representative at San Girolamo and also \"General Economist\" or treasurer of the Franciscan order - who used this position to put the Franciscan press at the ratline's disposal; and [[Monsignor]] Karlo Petranovi\u0107, based in [[Genoa]]. Vilim would make contact with those hiding in Austria and help them across the border to Italy; Kamber, Mandi\u0107 and Draganovi\u0107 would find them lodgings, often in the monastery itself, while they arranged documentation; finally Draganovi\u0107 would phone Petranovi\u0107 in [[Genoa]] with the number of required berths on ships leaving for South America (see [[#The Argentine Connection|below]]).\n\nThe operation of the Draganovi\u0107 ratline was an open secret among the intelligence and diplomatic communities in [[Rome]]. As early as August 1945, Allied commanders in Rome were asking questions about the use of San Girolamo as a \"haven\" for [[Usta\u0161e]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domovod.info/showthread.php?277-Krunoslav-Draganovic-From-Pavelic-Papers-com |title=Krunoslav Draganovic - From Pavelic-Papers.com|website=Domovod.info|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nA year later, a [[United States State Department|US State Department]] report of 12 July 1946 lists nine war criminals, including [[Albanians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] as well as Croats, plus others \"not actually sheltered in the COLLEGIUM ILLIRICUM [i.e., San Girolamo degli Illirici] but who otherwise enjoy Church support and protection.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krajinaforce.com/dokumenti/pavelic-papers.pdf|title=The Pavelic Papers: Documents|website=Krajinaforce.com|accessdate=2016-12-21}}</ref> The British envoy to the Holy See, [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|Sir D'Arcy Osborne]], asked [[Domenico Tardini]], a high-ranking Vatican official, for permission that would have allowed British military police to raid ex-territorial Vatican Institutions in Rome. Tardini declined and denied the church was sheltering war criminals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn February 1947, CIC Special Agent Robert Clayton Mudd reported ten members of Paveli\u0107's [[Usta\u0161e|Usta\u0161a]] cabinet living either in San Girolamo or in the Vatican itself. Mudd had infiltrated an agent into the monastery and confirmed that it was \"honeycombed with cells of Ustashe operatives\" guarded by \"armed youths\". Mudd reported:\n\n<blockquote>It was further established that these Croats travel back and forth from the Vatican several times a week in a car with a chauffeur whose license plate bears the two initials CD, \"Corpo Diplomatico\". It issues forth from the Vatican and discharges its passengers inside the Monastery of San Geronimo.

The Vatican, undoubtedly banking on the strong anti-Communist feelings of these men, is endeavoring to infiltrate them into South America in any way possible to counteract the spread of Red doctrine. It has been reliably reported, for example that Dr. VRANCIC has already gone to South America and that Ante PAVELIC and General KREN are scheduled for an early departure to South America through Spain. All these operations are said to have been negotiated by DRAGANOVIC because of his influence in the Vatican.</blockquote>\n\nThe existence of Draganovi\u0107's ratline has been supported by a highly respected historian of Vatican diplomacy, Fr. [[Robert A. Graham|Robert Graham]]: \"I've no doubt that Draganovi\u0107 was extremely active in syphoning off his Croatian Ustashe friends.\" Graham claimed that Draganovi\u0107, in running his 'ratline,' was not acting on behalf of the Vatican: \"Just because he's a priest doesn't mean he represents the Vatican. It was his own operation.\"{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|p=89}} At the same time, there were four occasions in which the Vatican did intervene on behalf of interned Ustasha prisoners.

As the report put it, these were \"visitors who had been in the custody of the 430th CIC and completely processed in accordance with current directives and requirements, and whose continued residence in Austria constituted a security threat as well as a source of possible embarrassment to the Commanding General of USFA, since the Soviet Command had become aware that their presence in [[Allied-occupied Austria|U.S. Zone of Austria]] and in some instances had requested the return of these persons to Soviet custody\".<ref name=Jasenovac/>\n\nThese were suspected war criminals from areas occupied by the [[Red Army]] which the U.S. was obliged to hand over for trial to the Soviets. The U.S. reputedly was reluctant to do so, partly due to a belief that fair trials could hardly be expected in the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|USSR]] (see [[Operation Keelhaul]]), and at the same time, their desire to make use of Nazi scientists and other resources. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe deal with Draganovi\u0107 involved getting the visitors to Rome: \"Dragonovich {{sic}} handled all phases of the operation after the defectees arrived in Rome, such as the procurement of IRO Italian and South American documents, visas, stamps, arrangements for disposition, land or sea, and notification of resettlement committees in foreign lands\".<ref name=Jasenovac/>\n\nUnited States intelligence used these methods in order to get important Nazi scientists and military strategists, to the extent they had not already been claimed by the Soviet Union, to their own centres of military science in the US.

According to Go\u00f1i, the Argentines not only collaborated with Draganovi\u0107's ratline, they set up further ratlines of their own running through [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]].\n\nAccording to Go\u00f1i, Argentina's first move into Nazi smuggling was in January 1946, when Argentine bishop [[Antonio Caggiano]], leader of the Argentine chapter of [[Catholic Action]] flew with another bishop, Agust\u00edn Barr\u00e9re, to Rome where Caggiano was due to be anointed Cardinal. In Rome the Argentine bishops met with French Cardinal [[Eug\u00e8ne Tisserant]], where they passed on a message (recorded in Argentina's diplomatic archives) that \"the Government of the Argentine Republic was willing to receive French persons, whose [[Collaboration during World War II|political attitude]] during the recent war would expose them, should they return to France, to harsh measures and private revenge\".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOver the spring of 1946, a number of French war criminals, [[French Fascism|fascists]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy]] officials made it from Italy to Argentina in the same way: they were issued passports by the Rome [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] office; these were then stamped with Argentine tourist visas (the need for health certificates and return tickets was waived on Caggiano's recommendation). The first documented case of a French war criminal arriving in Buenos Aires was [[\u00c9mile Dewoitine]], who was later sentenced in absentia to 20 years hard labour. He sailed first class on the same ship back with Cardinal Caggiano.{{sfn|Go\u00f1i|2003|pp=96\u201398}}\n\nShortly after this Argentinian Nazi smuggling became institutionalised, according to Go\u00f1i, when Per\u00f3n's new government of February 1946 appointed [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Santiago Peralta as Immigration Commissioner and former [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] agent Ludwig Freude as his intelligence chief.

The most famous such network is ODESSA (Organisation of former SS members), founded in 1946 according to [[Simon Wiesenthal]], which included [[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer|SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]] [[Otto Skorzeny]] and [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] [[Alfred Naujocks]] and, in Argentina, [[Rodolfo Freude]].

Wiesenthal describes these immediately after the war as Nazi cells based in areas of Austria where many Nazis had retreated and [[wiktionary:go to ground|gone to ground]].

According to historian [[Michael Phayer]], \"this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=179}}\n\nSpain, not Rome, was the \"first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists,\" although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=180}} Among the primary organizers were [[Charles Lescat]], a French member of [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]] &ndash; an organization suppressed by [[Pope Pius XI]] and rehabilitated by [[Pope Pius XII]] &ndash; and [[Pierre Daye]], a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=182}} Lescat and Daye were the first to flee Europe with the help of Argentine cardinal [[Antonio Caggiano]].{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=182}}\n\nBy 1946, there were hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=183}} According to then-[[United States Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], Vatican cooperation in turning over these \"asylum-seekers\" was \"negligible\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=183}} According to Phayer, Pius XII \"preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camps in zonal Germany\".{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=187}} Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy that centered on [[Vatican City]], the ratlines of Spain, although \"fostered by the Vatican,\" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau.{{sfn|Phayer|2008|p=188}}\n\n==Roman ratlines==\n===Early efforts: Bishop Hudal===\nAustrian Catholic bishop [[Alois Hudal]], a Nazi sympathiser, was rector of the [[Pontificio Istituto Teutonico Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in [[Rome]], a seminary for [[Austria]]n and [[Germany|German]] priests, and \"Spiritual Director of the German People resident in Italy\".<ref>{{harv|Aarons|Loftus|1998|p=36}}</ref> After the end of the war in Italy, Hudal became active in ministering to German-speaking [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and internees then held in camps throughout Italy. In December 1944, the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] [[Vatican Secretariat of State|Secretariat of State]] received permission to appoint a representative to \"visit the German-speaking civil internees in Italy\", a job assigned to Hudal.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nHudal used this position to aid the escape of wanted Nazi [[war crime|war criminals]], including [[Franz Stangl]], commanding officer of [[Treblinka]], [[Gustav Wagner (SS officer)|Gustav Wagner]], commanding officer of [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Alois Brunner]], responsible for the [[Drancy internment camp]] near Paris and in charge of deportations in Slovakia to German [[concentration camp]]s, and [[Adolf Eichmann]]{{sfn|Phayer|2000|p=11}}\u2014a fact about which he was later unashamedly open. Some of these wanted men were being held in internment camps: generally without identity papers, they would be enrolled in camp registers under false names. Other Nazis hid in Italy and sought Hudal out as his role in assisting escapes became known on the Nazi grapevine.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=289}}\n\nIn his memoirs, Hudal said of his actions, \"I thank God that He [allowed me] to visit and comfort many victims in their prisons and concentration camps and to help them escape with false identity papers.\"<ref>Hudal, ''R\u00f6mische Tageb\u00fccher'' {{harv|Aarons|Loftus|1998|p=37}}</ref> He explained that in his eyes:\n\n<blockquote>The Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting. This so-called business ... used catchwords like democracy, race, religious liberty and Christianity as a bait for the masses. All these experiences were the reason why I felt duty bound after 1945 to devote my whole charitable work mainly to former National Socialists and Fascists, especially to so-called 'war criminals'.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Mark Aarons]] and [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] in their book ''Unholy Trinity'', Hudal was the first Catholic priest to dedicate himself to establishing escape routes.{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|loc=ch. 2}} Aarons and Loftus claim that Hudal provided the objects of his charity with money to help them escape and, more importantly, provided them with false papers, including identity documents issued by the Vatican Refugee Organisation (''[[Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza]]''). These Vatican papers were not full passports and thus were not enough to gain passage overseas. They were, rather, the first stop in a paper trail\u2014they could be used to obtain a displaced person passport from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), which in turn could be used to apply for visas. In theory, the ICRC would perform background checks on passport applicants, but in practice the word of a priest or particularly a bishop would be good enough. According to statements collected by Austrian writer [[Gitta Sereny]] from a senior official of the Rome branch of the ICRC,{{sfn|Sereny|1983|pp=316\u201317}} Hudal could also use his position as a bishop to request papers from the ICRC \"made out according to his specifications\". Sereny's sources also revealed an active illicit trade in stolen and forged ICRC papers in Rome at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAccording to declassified U.S. intelligence reports, Hudal was not the only priest helping Nazi escapees at this time. In the \"La Vista Report\" declassified in 1984, [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) operative Vincent La Vista told how he had easily arranged for two bogus Hungarian refugees to get false ICRC documents with the help of a letter from a Father Joseph Gallov. Gallov, who ran a Vatican-sponsored charity for Hungarian refugees, asked no questions and wrote a letter to his \"personal contact in the International Red Cross, who then issued the passports\".{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|pp=43\u201345}}\n\n===San Girolamo ratline===\nAccording to Aarons and Loftus, Hudal's private operation was small scale compared to what came later. The major Roman ratline was operated by a small, but influential network of [[Croatia]]n priests, members of the [[Franciscan]] order, led by Father [[Krunoslav Draganovi\u0107]], who organized a highly sophisticated chain with headquarters at the [[San Girolamo degli Illirici]] Seminary College in Rome, but with links from Austria to the final embarcation point at the port of [[Genoa]]. The ratline initially focused on aiding members of the Croatian [[Usta\u0161e]] including its leader (or [[Poglavnik]]), [[Ante Paveli\u0107]].{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|loc=ch. 5}}\n\nPriests active in the chain included: Fr. Vilim Cecelja, former Deputy Military Vicar to the [[Usta\u0161e]], based in [[Austria]] where many Ustashe and Nazi refugees remained in hiding; Fr. Dragutin Kamber, based at San Girolamo; Fr. [[Dominik Mandi\u0107]], an official [[Holy See|Vatican]] representative at San Girolamo and also \"General Economist\" or treasurer of the Franciscan order - who used this position to put the Franciscan press at the ratline's disposal; and [[Monsignor]] Karlo Petranovi\u0107, based in [[Genoa]]. Vilim would make contact with those hiding in Austria and help them across the border to Italy; Kamber, Mandi\u0107 and Draganovi\u0107 would find them lodgings, often in the monastery itself, while they arranged documentation; finally Draganovi\u0107 would phone Petranovi\u0107 in [[Genoa]] with the number of required berths on ships leaving for South America (see [[#The Argentine Connection|below]]).\n\nThe operation of the Draganovi\u0107 ratline was an open secret among the intelligence and diplomatic communities in [[Rome]]. As early as August 1945, Allied commanders in Rome were asking questions about the use of San Girolamo as a \"haven\" for [[Usta\u0161e]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domovod.info/showthread.php?277-Krunoslav-Draganovic-From-Pavelic-Papers-com |title=Krunoslav Draganovic - From Pavelic-Papers.com|website=Domovod.info|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nA year later, a [[United States State Department|US State Department]] report of 12 July 1946 lists nine war criminals, including [[Albanians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] as well as Croats, plus others \"not actually sheltered in the COLLEGIUM ILLIRICUM [i.e., San Girolamo degli Illirici] but who otherwise enjoy Church support and protection.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krajinaforce.com/dokumenti/pavelic-papers.pdf|title=The Pavelic Papers: Documents|website=Krajinaforce.com|accessdate=2016-12-21}}</ref> The British envoy to the Holy See, [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|Sir D'Arcy Osborne]], asked [[Domenico Tardini]], a high-ranking Vatican official, for permission that would have allowed British military police to raid ex-territorial Vatican Institutions in Rome. Tardini declined and denied the church was sheltering war criminals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn February 1947, CIC Special Agent Robert Clayton Mudd reported ten members of Paveli\u0107's [[Usta\u0161e|Usta\u0161a]] cabinet living either in San Girolamo or in the Vatican itself. Mudd had infiltrated an agent into the monastery and confirmed that it was \"honeycombed with cells of Ustashe operatives\" guarded by \"armed youths\". Mudd reported:\n\n<blockquote>It was further established that these Croats travel back and forth from the Vatican several times a week in a car with a chauffeur whose license plate bears the two initials CD, \"Corpo Diplomatico\". It issues forth from the Vatican and discharges its passengers inside the Monastery of San Geronimo. Subject to diplomatic immunity it is impossible to stop the car and discover who are its passengers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Avraham|first=Yerachmiel Ben|title=All in the Name of Jesus: The Murder of Millions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TljzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT207|page=207|isbn=9781622176342|date=2016-04-12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMudd's conclusion was the following:\n<blockquote>DRAGANOVIC's sponsorship of these Croat [[Ustashe]]s definitely links him up with the plan of the Vatican to shield these ex-Ustasha nationalists until such time as they are able to procure for them the proper documents to enable them to go to South America. The Vatican, undoubtedly banking on the strong anti-Communist feelings of these men, is endeavoring to infiltrate them into South America in any way possible to counteract the spread of Red doctrine. It has been reliably reported, for example that Dr. VRANCIC has already gone to South America and that Ante PAVELIC and General KREN are scheduled for an early departure to South America through Spain. All these operations are said to have been negotiated by DRAGANOVIC because of his influence in the Vatican.</blockquote>\n\nThe existence of Draganovi\u0107's ratline has been supported by a highly respected historian of Vatican diplomacy, Fr. [[Robert A. Graham|Robert Graham]]: \"I've no doubt that Draganovi\u0107 was extremely active in syphoning off his Croatian Ustashe friends.\" Graham claimed that Draganovi\u0107, in running his 'ratline,' was not acting on behalf of the Vatican: \"Just because he's a priest doesn't mean he represents the Vatican. It was his own operation.\"{{sfn|Aarons|Loftus|1998|p=89}} At the same time, there were four occasions in which the Vatican did intervene on behalf of interned Ustasha prisoners. The Secretariat of State asked the UK and US governments to release Croatian POWs from [[United Kingdom|British]] [[internment camps]] in Italy.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===U.S. intelligence involvement===\nIf at first U.S. intelligence officers had been mere observers of the Draganovi\u0107 ratline, this changed in the summer of 1947. A now declassified U.S. Army intelligence report from 1950 sets out in detail the history of the people smuggling operation in the three years to follow.<ref name=Jasenovac>\"History of the Italian Rat Line\" (10 April 1950), document signed by \"IB Operating Officer\" Paul E. Lyon, 430th Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), Headquarters of the U.S. Forces in Austria. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008205604/http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/army/ar0002.html |date=2007-10-08 }}, from [http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/army/ar0002.html the original], jasenovac-info.com; accessed 4 August 2017.</ref>\n\nAccording to the report, from this point on U.S. forces themselves had begun to use Draganovi\u0107's established network to evacuate its own \"visitors\". As the report put it, these were \"visitors who had been in the custody of the 430th CIC and completely processed in accordance with current directives and requirements, and whose continued residence in Austria constituted a security threat as well as a source of possible embarrassment to the Commanding General of USFA, since the Soviet Command had become aware that their presence in [[Allied-occupied Austria|U.S. Zone of Austria]] and in some instances had requested the return of these persons to Soviet custody\".<ref name=Jasenovac/>\n\nThese were suspected war criminals from areas occupied by the [[Red Army]] which the U.S. was obliged to hand over for trial to the Soviets. The U.S. reputedly was reluctant to do so, partly due to a belief that fair trials could hardly be expected in the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|USSR]] (see [[Operation Keelhaul]]), and at the same time, their desire to make use of Nazi scientists and other resources. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe deal with Draganovi\u0107 involved getting the visitors to Rome: \"Dragonovich {{sic}} handled all phases of the operation after the defectees arrived in Rome, such as the procurement of IRO Italian and South American documents, visas, stamps, arrangements for disposition, land or sea, and notification of resettlement committees in foreign lands\".<ref name=Jasenovac/>\n\nUnited States intelligence used these methods in order to get important Nazi scientists and military strategists, to the extent they had not already been claimed by the Soviet Union, to their own centres of military science in the US. Many Nazi scientists were employed by the U.S., retrieved in [[Operation Paperclip]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Argentine connection===\n{{see also|Juan Per\u00f3n#Jewish and German communities of Argentina}}\n<blockquote>In Nuremberg at that time something was taking place that I personally considered a disgrace and an unfortunate lesson for the future of humanity.

According to Go\u00f1i, the Argentines not only collaborated with Draganovi\u0107's ratline, they set up further ratlines of their own running through [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]].\n\nAccording to Go\u00f1i, Argentina's first move into Nazi smuggling was in January 1946, when Argentine bishop [[Antonio Caggiano]], leader of the Argentine chapter of [[Catholic Action]] flew with another bishop, Agust\u00edn Barr\u00e9re, to Rome where Caggiano was due to be anointed Cardinal. In Rome the Argentine bishops met with French Cardinal [[Eug\u00e8ne Tisserant]], where they passed on a message (recorded in Argentina's diplomatic archives) that \"the Government of the Argentine Republic was willing to receive French persons, whose [[Collaboration during World War II|political attitude]] during the recent war would expose them, should they return to France, to harsh measures and private revenge\".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOver the spring of 1946, a number of French war criminals, [[French Fascism|fascists]] and [[Vichy France|Vichy]] officials made it from Italy to Argentina in the same way: they were issued passports by the Rome [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] office; these were then stamped with Argentine tourist visas (the need for health certificates and return tickets was waived on Caggiano's recommendation). The first documented case of a French war criminal arriving in Buenos Aires was [[\u00c9mile Dewoitine]], who was later sentenced in absentia to 20 years hard labour. He sailed first class on the same ship back with Cardinal Caggiano.{{sfn|Go\u00f1i|2003|pp=96\u201398}}\n\nShortly after this Argentinian Nazi smuggling became institutionalised, according to Go\u00f1i, when Per\u00f3n's new government of February 1946 appointed [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Santiago Peralta as Immigration Commissioner and former [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] agent Ludwig Freude as his intelligence chief. Go\u00f1i argues that these two then set up a \"rescue team\" of secret service agents and immigration \"advisors\", many of whom were themselves European war-criminals, with Argentine [[citizenship]] and employment.{{sfn|Go\u00f1i|2003|loc=ch. 8}}\n\nIn 2014, over 700 FBI documents were declassified revealing that the US government had undertaken an investigation in the late 1940s and 1950s as to the reports of [[Conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler's death|the possible escape of Adolf Hitler]] from Germany.

Until the work of Aarons and Loftus, and of [[Uki Go\u00f1i]] (2002), a common view was that ex-Nazis themselves, organised in secret networks, ran the escape routes alone. The most famous such network is ODESSA (Organisation of former SS members), founded in 1946 according to [[Simon Wiesenthal]], which included [[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer|SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]] [[Otto Skorzeny]] and [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] [[Alfred Naujocks]] and, in Argentina, [[Rodolfo Freude]]. [[Alois Brunner]], former commandant of [[Drancy internment camp]] near Paris, escaped to Rome, then [[Syria]], by ODESSA. Brunner was thought to be the highest-ranking Nazi war criminal still alive as of 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nPersons claiming to represent ODESSA claimed responsibility for the unsuccessful July 9, 1979, car bombing in France aimed at [[Nazi hunter]]s [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} According to [[Paul Manning (journalist)|Paul Manning]], \"eventually, over 10,000 former German military made it to South America along escape routes ODESSA and Deutsche Hilfsverein...\"<ref>[[Paul Manning (journalist)|Paul Manning]], ''[[Martin Bormann]]: Nazi in Exile'' Lyle Stuart, Inc.

Wiesenthal describes these immediately after the war as Nazi cells based in areas of Austria where many Nazis had retreated and [[wiktionary:go to ground|gone to ground]].

According to [[Francis Fukuyama]], the 1979 constitution is a \"hybrid\" of \"theocratic and democratic elements\" with much of it based on the ideas Khomeini presented in his work ''[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist]]'' (''Hukumat-e Islami'').<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203946904574300374086282670 |date=July 27, 2009 |title=Iran, Islam and the Rule of Law |first=Francis |last=Fukuyama |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref> In the work, Khomeini argued that government must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic ''[[sharia]]'', and for this to happen a leading Islamic jurist (''[[faqih]]'') must provide political \"guardianship\" (''wilayat'' or ''velayat'') over the people. The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (Shura yi Nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih. (Halm, 120-121)\n\n===1989===\nShortly before Imam Khomeini's death a change was made in the constitution allowing a lower ranking Shia cleric to become Supreme Leader.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B.

According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the [[Iranian Revolution]] because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.

The leading jurist were known as ''[[Marja']].''\n\nThe Constitution stresses the importance of the clergy in government, with Article 4 stating  that <blockquote>\u201call civil, criminal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other statutes and regulations (must) be keeping with Islamic measures;\u2026the Islamic legal scholars of the watch council (Shura yi Nigahban) will keep watch over this.\u201d<ref name=\"preamble\">{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html|title=ICL - Iran - Constitution|publisher=|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote> and the importance of the Supreme Leader. Article 5 states \n<blockquote>\u201cduring the absence of the removed [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Twelfth Imam]] (may God hasten his reappearance) government and leadership of the community in the Islamic Republic of Iran belong to the rightful God fearing\u2026 legal scholar (Faqih) who is recognized and acknowledged as the Islamic leader by the majority of the population.\u201d</blockquote> \nArticle 107 in the constitution mentions Imam Khomeini by name and praises him as the most learned and talented leader for emulation (''marja-i taqlid'').   The responsibilities of the Supreme Leader are vaguely stated in the constitution, thus any \u2018violation\u2019 by the Supreme Leader would be dismissed almost immediately.  As the rest of the clergy governed affairs on a daily basis, the Supreme Leader is capable of mandating a new decision as per the concept of Vilayat-e Faqih.

Montazeri was demoted as a marja and Khomeini chose  a new successor, a relatively low-ranking member of the clergy, [[Ali Khamene'i]]. However Article 109 stipulated that the leader be `a source of imitation` (Marja-e taqlid). Khomeini wrote a letter to the president of the Assembly for Revising the Constitution, which was in session at the time, making the necessary arrangements to designate Khamene'i as his successor, and Article 109 was revised accordingly.<ref name=asghar.p73>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'' / by Asghar Schirazi, London ; New York : I.B. Tauris, 1997  p.73-75</ref> \"Khomeini is supposed to have written a letter to the Chairman of the assembly of Leadership Experts on 29.4.89 in which he emphasised that he had always been of the opinion that the marja'iyat was not a requirement for the office of leader.<ref name=asghar.p73/>\n\n==Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (Velayat-e faghih)==\n{{Main|Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist}}\n[[File:Ali Khamenei met with Hajj authorities 2018 09.jpg|thumb|Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] met with [[Hajj]] authorities, 2018]]\nThe constitution of Iran combines concepts of both [[democracy]] and [[theocracy]], theocracy in the form of Khomeini's concept of ''vilayat-e faqih'' (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), as expressed in the ''Islamic Republic''.  According to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist was not [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists#Limited guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|restricted]] to orphans or mental incompetents, but applied to everyone in absence of the [[twelfth Imam]]. Jurists were the only rightful political/governmental leaders because \"God had commanded Islamic government\" and \"no one knew religion better than the [[ulama]]\" (Islamic clergy).<ref name=nasr.p125/> They alone would preserve \"Islamic order\" and keep everyone from deviating from \"the just path of Islam\".<ref>Khomeini, ''Islam and Revolution, Writings and Declarations Of Imam Khomeini'' p.54</ref> Prior to the revolution observant Shia Muslims selected their own leading faqih to emulate (known as a ''[[Marja']]-i taqlid'') according to their own decision making. The \u201ccongregation rather than the hierarchy decided how prominent the ayatollah was\u201d thus allowing the public to possibly limit the influence of the Faqih.<ref name=nasr.p125>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W. W. Norton & Company, Apr 17, 2007, p.?</ref>\n\nAfter the revolution Shia Muslims (or at least Iranian Shia) were commanded to show allegiance to the current ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|vali-e faghih]]'', Guardian Jurist or Supreme Leader.   In this new system, the jurist oversaw all governmental affairs.    The complete control exercised by the Faqih was not to be limited to the [[Iranian Revolution]] because the revolution and its Leader had international aspirations. As the constitution of the Islamic Republic states, it \n<blockquote>intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of Islamic norms.  ... the Constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the Revolution at home and abroad.  In particular, in the development of international relations, the Constitution will strive with other Islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community (in accordance with the Koranic verse `This your community is a single community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me` [21:92]), and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world.<ref name=\"preamble\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author Seyyed Vali Nasr, Khomeini appealed to the masses, during the pre-1979 period, by referring to them as the oppressed and with charisma and political ability was tremendously successful. He became a very popular role model for [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] and hoped for the Iranian Revolution to be the first step to a much larger Islamic revolution, transcending Shia Islam, in the same way that [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] wanted [[Russian Revolution|their revolution]] to be a world revolution, not just a [[Russia|Russian]] one.<ref>Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza, ''The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future'', W.
