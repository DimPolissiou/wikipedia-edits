Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections.

The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.

The history of ideas is a sister-discipline to, or a particular approach within, [[intellectual history]].  Work in the history of ideas may involve interdisciplinary research in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of science]], or the [[history of literature]]. In [[Sweden]], the history of ideas and science or [[Swedish history of ideas|''Id\u00e9- och l\u00e4rdomshistoria'']] has been a distinct university subject since 6 November 1932, when [[Johan Nordstr\u00f6m]], a scholar of literature, was appointed professor of the new discipline in a ceremony at [[Uppsala University]] (coinciding with that commemorating the 300-year anniversary of the [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1632)|Battle of L\u00fctzen]]). Today, several universities across the world provide courses in this field, usually as part of a graduate programme.\n\n==The Lovejoy approach==\nThe historian [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] (1873\u20131962) coined the phrase ''history of ideas''{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and initiated its systematic study<ref name=greatchain>Arthur Lovejoy: ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'' (1936), {{ISBN|0-674-36153-9}}</ref> in the early decades of the 20th century. [[Johns Hopkins University]] was a \"fertile cradle\" to Lovejoy's history of ideas;<ref name=\"Paulson1970\">[[Ronald Paulson]] [https://www.jstor.org/pss/468272 ''English Literary History at the Johns Hopkins University''] in ''New Literary History'', Vol. 1, No. 3, History and Fiction (Spring, 1970), pp. 559\u2013564</ref> he worked there as a professor of history, from 1910 to 1939, and for decades he presided over the regular meetings of the ''History of Ideas Club''.<ref>Arthur Lovejoy, ''Essays in the History of Ideas,'' {{ISBN|0-313-20504-3}}</ref> Another outgrowth of his work is the ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]''.\n\nAside from his students and colleagues engaged in related projects (such as [[Ren\u00e9 Wellek]] and [[Leo Spitzer]], with whom Lovejoy engaged in extended debates), scholars such as [[Isaiah Berlin]],<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Against the Current: Essays in the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-691-09026-2}}</ref> [[Michel Foucault]], [[John Edward Christopher Hill|Christopher Hill]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], and others have continued to work in a spirit close to that with which Lovejoy pursued the history of ideas.  The first chapter of Lovejoy's book ''The Great Chain of Being'' (1936) lays out a general overview of what he intended to be the programme and scope of the study of the history of ideas.<ref name=greatchain/>\n\n==Unit-ideas==\nLovejoy's history of ideas takes as its basic unit of analysis the unit-idea, or the individual concept.  These unit-ideas work as the building-blocks of the history of ideas: though they are relatively unchanged in themselves over the course of time, unit-ideas recombine in new patterns and gain expression in new forms in different historical eras.  As Lovejoy saw it, the historian of ideas had the task of identifying such unit-ideas and of describing their historical emergence and recession in new forms and combinations.\n\nThe unit-idea methodology, intended to extract the basic idea within any philosophical work and movement,<ref name=\"greatchain\"/> also has certain defining principles: 1) assumptions, 2) dialectical motives, 3) metaphysical pathos, and 4) philosophical semantics. These different principles define the overarching philosophical movement within which, Lovejoy argues, one can find the unit-idea, which can then be studied throughout the history of that idea.\n\n==Other approaches==\n[[Quentin Skinner]] criticizes Lovejoy's \"unit-idea\" methodology, and he argues that such a \"reification of doctrines\" has negative consequences.['''which ones?'''] <ref>Quentin Skinner (1969). \"Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas\". ''History and Theory'' '''8''' (1): 3\u201353.</ref>  He emphasized sensitivity to the cultural context of the texts and ideas being analysed. Skinner's own [[historical method]]ology is based on [[J.L. Austin]]'s theory of speech acts. Skinner's approach has been criticized in turn by scholars who have pointed out his inclination to reify structures and sociological constructs over individual actors. Notably, [[Andreas Dorschel]] criticizes Skinner's restrictive approach to ideas through verbal language, and points out how ideas can materialize in non-linguistic media or genres such as music and architecture.<ref>Andreas Dorschel, ''Ideengeschichte.'' G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht,  2010. {{ISBN|978-3-8252-3314-3}}</ref> The global historian of ideas [[Dag Herbj\u00f8rnsrud]] writes that \"the Skinner perspective is in danger of shutting the door to comparative philosophy and the search for common problems and solutions across borders and time.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Herbj\u00f8rnsrud|first=Dag|date=2019-05-10|title=Beyond decolonizing: global intellectual history and reconstruction of a comparative method|journal=Global Intellectual History|volume=0|pages=1\u201327|doi=10.1080/23801883.2019.1616310|issn=2380-1883}}</ref> Skinner's idea has also been criticised as too context sensible and thus unable to provide any unified accounts of the development of ideas over time.\n\nAnother important development within the study of ideas has been within the academic discipline of [[Intellectual History]]. The [[Harvard]] historian [[Peter Gordon (historian)|Peter Gordon]] explains that intellectual history, as opposed to the history of ideas practiced by Lovejoy, studies and deals with ideas within a broader context.<ref name=\"history.fas.harvard.edu\">Peter E. Gordon, [http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/history/files/what_is_intell_history_pgordon_mar2012.pdf \"What is intellectual history? A frankly partisan introduction to a frequently misunderstood field\"]. Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</ref> Gordon further emphasises that intellectual historians, as opposed to historians of ideas and philosophers ([[History of Philosophy]]), \"tend to be more relaxed about crossing the boundary between philosophical texts and non-philosophical contexts...[they regard] the distinction between \"philosophy\" and \"non-philosophy\" as something that is itself historically conditioned rather than eternally fixed.\"<ref name=\"history.fas.harvard.edu\"/> Thus, intellectual historians who see intellectual history as a means of reproducing a historically valid interpretation of a philosophical argument, tend to implement a contextualist approach when studying ideas and broader philosophical movements.\n\n==Foucault's approach==\n{{see also|Genealogy (philosophy)|The Archaeology of Knowledge}}\n\n[[Michel Foucault]] rejects the idea of the traditional way historians go about writing, which is a narrative. He believed that most historians preferred to write about long periods of time instead of digging deeper into a more specific history.<ref>Felluga, Dino. [http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/newhistoricism/modules/foucaulthistory.html \"Modules on Foucault: On History\"]. Introductory Guide to Critical Theory.</ref> Foucault argues that historians should reveal historical descriptions through different perspectives. This is where he comes up with the term \u201carchaeology\u201d for his method of historical writing. His historical method differs from the traditional sense of historical writing and is divided up into four different ideas.\n\nThe first is that \"archaeology\" seeks to define the history through philosophical means, which is to say the discourse between thought, representation, and themes. The second is that, in \"archaeology,\" the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines. The third idea is that \"archaeology\" does not seek to grasp the moment in history at which the individual and the social are inverted into one another. And finally the fourth point is that \"archaeology\" does not seek the truth of history, rather it seeks the discourse in it.<ref>Foucault, Michel.
