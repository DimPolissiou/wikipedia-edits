It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]], the holy mountain the abode of gods. The whole temple is a model of Hindu universe according to [[Hindu cosmology]] and the layers of [[Loka]].<ref name=\"SEDYAWATIp4\">{{harvp|Sedyawati|2013|p=4}}</ref>\n\n=== Structure elements ===\n[[File:Prambanan Cross Section Shiva.svg|thumb|upright|The Shiva temple Candi Prambanan consist of three ascending realms, temple's base (Bhurloka), body (Bhurvaloka) and roof (Svarloka).]]\nThe candi structure and layout recognize the hierarchy of the zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

The outer courtyard and the foot (base) part of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhurloka''.\n* [[Bhuvarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Rupajhana|Rupadhatu]]''), the middle realm of holy people, [[rishi]]s, ascetics, and lesser gods.

The middle courtyard and the body of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''bhuvarloka''.\n* [[Svarloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Arupajhana|Arupadhatu]]''), the highest and holiest realm of gods, also known as ''[[svarga]]loka''. The inner courtyard and the roof of each temples is symbolized the realm of ''svarloka''. The roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with ''[[Gemstone|ratna]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: jewel) or [[vajra]], or in eastern Java period, crowned by cube structure.

It was one of the earliest temple in Java.]]\nThere are material, form, and location exceptions to these general design traits. While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

It is often modeled after East Javanese temples, and functions as a shrine to a certain deity. To the Balinese, a ''candi'' is not necessarily ancient, since ''candis'' continue to be (re-)built within these puras, such as the reconstructed temple in [[Alas Purwo National Park|Alas Purwo]], [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangi]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Kedaulatan Rakyat|title=Peninggalan Majapahit Yang Tersembunyi di Alas Purwo |author=Tomi Sujatmiko | date=9 June 2013 | language=Indonesian|url=http://krjogja.com/read/175829/peninggalan-majapahit-yang-tersembunyi-di-alas-purwo.kr}}</ref>\n\nIn contemporary [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Indonesian Buddhist]] perspective, ''candi'' also refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary ''[[vihara]]s'' in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of [[Pawon]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Replika Candi Pawon|work=Vih\u0101ra Jakarta Dhammacakka Jaya|url=http://www.dhammacakka.org/?channel=tentangkami&mode=detailfasilitas&id=93}}</ref> and [[Plaosan]]'s ''perwara'' (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a ''candi'' as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a [[stupa]], a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. [[Borobudur]], [[Muara Takus]] and [[Batujaya]] for example are actually elaborate stupas.\n\nIn modern [[Indonesian language]], the term ''candi'' can be translated as \"temple\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of [[Cambodia]] (such as the [[Angkor Wat]]), Champa (Central and Southern [[Vietnam]]), [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and [[India]] are also called ''candi'' in Indonesian.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prambanan]] temple compound.

However, the term also applied to many non-religious structures dated from the same period, such as ''gapura'' (gates),'' petirtaan'' (pools) and some of habitation complexes. Examples of non-temple candis are the Bajang Ratu and Wringin Lawang gates of [[Majapahit]]. The \"Candi Tikus bathing pool\" in [[Trowulan]] and Jalatunda in Penanggungan slopes, as well as the remnants of non-religious habitation and urban structures such as [[Ratu Boko]] and some of Trowulan city ruins, are also considered ''candi''.\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 40%\n| align  = right\n| quote  = \"Between the 7th and 15th centuries, hundred of religious structures were constructed of brick and stone in Java, Sumatra and Bali.

The association of the name \"candi\", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in [[India]] and other parts of Southeast Asia outside of Indonesia, such as [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], or [[Burma]].\n\nAnother theory from Buddhist perspective, suggested that the term \"candi\" might be a localized form of the [[Pali]] word ''cedi'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''caitya'') \u2014 which related to [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''chedi'' which refer to a [[stupa]], or it might be related to the [[Cundi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva Cand\u012b]] (also known as Cund\u012b or Cand\u0101).<ref>{{cite web | title = History of Women in Buddhism - Indonesia: Part 10  | work = Shakyadita: Awakening Buddhist Women | url = http://awakeningbuddhistwomen.blogspot.co.id/2015/06/history-of-women-in-buddhism-indonesia_29.html}}</ref>\n\nHistorians suggest that the temples of ancient Java were also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalty. This is in line with Buddhist concept of [[stupas]] as structures to store Buddhist relics, including the ashes and remains of holy Buddhist priests or the Buddhist king, patrons of Buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the [[garbhagriha]] (main chamber) of the temple is often modeled after the deceased king and considered to be the deified person of the king portrayed as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] according to the concept of [[devaraja]]. The example is the statue of king [[Airlangga]] from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding [[Garuda]].\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|left|upright|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a [[Mandala]]]]\nThe candi architecture follows the typical [[Hindu architecture]] traditions based on [[Vastu Shastra]]. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated [[mandala]] temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples.

The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (center), and head (roof). The three zones is arranged according to a sacred hierarchy. Each Hindu and Buddhist concepts has their own terms, but the concept's essentials is identical. Either the compound site plan (horizontally) or the temple structure (vertically) consists of three zones:<ref>[http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11 Konservasi Borobudur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726234819/http://konservasiborobudur.org/?p=11# |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Indonesian)</ref>\n* [[Bhuloka|Bhurloka]] (in Buddhism: ''[[Desire realm|K\u0101madh\u0101tu]]''), the lowest realm of common mortals; humans, animals also demons.

While the Penataran, Jawi, Jago, Kidal and Singhasari temples, for example, belong to the eastern Java group, they use andesite stone similar to the central Java temple material. Temple ruins in [[Trowulan]], such as Brahu, Jabung and Pari temples use red brick. Also the Prambanan temple is tall and slender similar to the east Java style, yet the roof design is central Javan in style. The location also do not always correlate with the temple styles, for example Candi Badut is located in Malang, East Java, yet the period and style belongs to older 8th century central Javanese style.\n\nThe earlier northern central Java complexes, such as the [[Dieng Plateau|Dieng temples]], are smaller and contain only several temples which exhibit simpler carving, whereas the later southern complexes, such as [[Sewu|Sewu temple]], are grander, with a richer elaboration of carving, and concentric layout of the temple complex.\n\nThe Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian megalithic design elements, such stepped pyramids (''punden berundak''). These design cues are seen in the [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples in [[Mount Lawu]] in eastern Central Java, and in stepped sanctuary structures on the [[Mount Penanggungan]] slopes that are similar to meso-American stepped pyramids.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Billbeee-borob.jpg|thumb|upright|Interlocking [[andesite]] stone blocks forming a [[Corbel arch|corbeling arch]] in Borobudur.]]\nMost of well-preserved ''candi'' in Indonesia are made from [[andesite]] stone. This is mainly owed to the stone's durability, compared to bricks, against tropical weathers and torrential rains. Nevertheless, certain periods, especially the Majapahit era, saw the extensive use of [[red brick]] as temple and building materials. The materials commonly used in temple construction in Indonesia are:\n\n*[[Andesite]] is an extrusive igneous [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition]], with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. Its colour ranges from light to dark grey. Andesite is especially abundant in the volcanic island of Java, mined from a certain cliffs or stone quarry with andesite deposit formed from compressed ancient magma chamber or cooled down lava spill. Each andesite stone is custom made into blocks with interlocking technique, to construct temple walls, floors and building. Andesite stones are easily formed and carved with iron [[chisel]], making it a suitable material for temple walls and decorations carved as [[bas-relief]]s. The walls of andesite was then carved with exquisite narrative bas-reliefs, which can be observed in many temples, especially in Borobudur and Prambanan. Andesite rocks are also used as the material for carved statues: the images of deities and Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|Red [[brick]] [[Jabung]] temple, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n*[[Brick]] is also used to construct temples. The oldest brick temple structure is the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in [[Karawang]], West Java, dated from 2nd to 12th century CE. Although brick had been used in the ''candi'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was [[Majapahit]] architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|last=Schoppert |first=P. |last2=Damais |first2=S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in [[Trowulan]], Pari in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo. Temples of Sumatra, such as [[Bahal temple]], [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]], and [[Muara Takus]] are made from bricks. However, compared to lava andesite stone, clay red bricks are less durable, especially if exposed to hot and humid tropical elements and torrential monsoon rain. As a result, many red brick structures were crumbling down over centuries, and reconstruction efforts require recasting and replacing the damaged structure with new bricks.\n*[[Tuff]] is a volcanic rock that is quite abundant near Javanese volcanoes or limestone formations. In Indonesian and Javanese languages, tuff is called ''batu putih'' (white stone), which corresponds to its light color. The chalky characteristic of this stone, however, has made it unsuitable to be carved into bas-reliefs of building ornaments. Compared to andesite, tuff is considered as an inferior quality building material. In Javanese temples, tuff usually are used as stone fillings \u2014 forming the inner structure of the temple \u2014 while the outer layer employed andesite that is more suitable to be carved. The tuff quarries can be found in Sewu limestone ranges near Ratu Boko hill. The tuff fillings in the temple can be examined in [[Ratu Boko]] crematorium temple. Tuff was used as building material of outer walls of temple compound, such as te walls found buried around Sewu and Sambisari temple.\n*[[Stucco]] is materials similar to modern [[concrete]], made from the mixture of sand, stone, water, and sometimes ground clamshell. The stucco as temple building material is observable in the [[Batujaya]] temple compound in West Java.\n[[File:Relief on Sari Temple wall, 2014-04-10 03.jpg|thumb|upright|Traces of worn off ''vajralepa'' plaster on [[Sari Temple|Sari]]'s relief.]]\n*[[Plaster]] called ''vajralepa'' (Sanskrit: diamond plaster) is used to coat the temple walls. The white-yellowish plaster is made from the mixture of ground [[limestone]], tuff or white earth ([[kaolin]]), with plant substances such as gums or resins as binder. The ''varjalepa'' white plaster was applied upon the andesite walls, and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching.<ref name=\"World Religions\">{{cite web |title =The Greatest Sacred Buildings |publisher =Museum of World Religions, Taipei |url =http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx |accessdate =4 May 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170207105433/http://www.mwr.org.tw/content_en/exhibitions/permanent-exhibition/sub_12.aspx# |archive-date =2017-02-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref> The traces of worn-off ''vajralepa'' plaster can be observed in Borobudur, [[Sari Temple|Sari]], [[Kalasan]] and [[Sewu]] temple walls.\n*[[Wood]] is believed to be used in some of ''candi'' construction or at least as parts of temple building material. Sari and [[Plaosan]] temples, for example, are known to have traces of stone indentions to support wooden beams and floors in its second floor, as well as traces of wooden stairs. [[Ratu Boko]] compound  has building bases and stone ''umpak'' column base, which suggests that the wooden capitals once stood there to support wooden roof structure made of organic materials. Traces of holes to install wooden window railings and wooden doors are observable in many of the ''perwara'' (complementary smaller) temples. Of course, wooden materials are easily decayed in a humid tropical climate, leaving no traces after centuries.\n\n== Motif and decoration ==\n\n=== Kala-Makara ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpg|thumb|upright|Kala-makara on the portal of Borobudur gates, Kala's head on top of the portal and makaras flanking either sides.]]\nThe candis of ancient Java are notable with the application of [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] as both decorative and symbolic elements of the temple architecture. [[kala (time)|Kala]] is the giant symbolizing [[time]], by making kala's head as temple portals element, it symbolizes that time consumes everything. Kala is also a protective figure, with fierce giant face it scares away malevolent spirits. [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]] is a mythical sea monster, the vahana of sea-god [[Varuna]]. It has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with the head of an [[elephant]]. It is also shown with head and jaws of a [[crocodile]], an elephant trunk, the tusks and ears of a wild [[boar]], the darting eyes of a [[monkey]], the scales and the flexible body of a [[fish]], and the swirling tailing feathers of a [[peacock]]. Both kala and makara are applied as the protective figures of the temple's entrance.\n\nKala is the giant head, often takes place on top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head, flanking the portal or projecting on the top corner as antefixes. The kala-makara theme also can be found on stair railings on either sides. On the upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs, with its curved bodies forming the stair's railings. Other than makaras, kala's head might also project its tongue as stair's railings. These types of stair-decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling [[gold]] ornaments or spouting [[Gemstone|jewels]], while in its mouth often projected [[Gana]] dwarf figures or animals such as [[lion]]s or [[parrot]]s.\n\n=== Linga-Yoni ===\n[[File:KITLV 87800 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Sculpture of a yoni with lingga at Yogyakarta - Before 1900.tif|thumb|upright|left|Central Javanese linga-yoni with spout decorated and supported by ''[[n\u0101ga]]'' serpent, Yogyakarta 9th century.]]\nIn ancient Javanese ''candi'', the linga-yoni symbolism was only found in Hindu temples, more precisely those of Shivaist faith. Therefore, they are absent in Buddhist temples. The [[linga]] is a [[phallic]] post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power. Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]]. The lingas that survive from the Javanese classical period are generally made of polished stone of this shape.\n\nLingas are implanted in a flat square base with a hole in it, called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb and also represents [[Parvati]], Shiva's consort. A yoni usually has a kind of spout, usually decorated with ''[[n\u0101ga]]'', to help channeled and collects the liquids poured upon linga-yoni during Hindu ritual. As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual. Oldest remains of linga-yoni can be found in [[Dieng temples]] from earlier period circa 7th century. Originally each temples might have a complete pair of linga-yoni unity. However, most of the times, the linga is missing.\n\nIn the tradition of Javanese kingship, certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself or his dynasty, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Shiva. The example is the linga-yoni of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, according to [[Canggal inscription]] is connected to King [[Sanjaya of Mataram|Sanjaya]] from the [[Mataram Kingdom]], in 654 [[Saka era|Saka]] (732 CE).<ref name=\"SEAKingdoms\">{{cite web|title =Candi Gunung Wukir | work= Southeast Asian Kingdoms |url =https://southeastasiankingdoms.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/candi-gunung-wukir/ |accessdate =22 October 2015}}</ref> Other temples that contains complete linga-yoni include [[Sambisari]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo temples]]. Eastern Javanese temples that contains linga-yoni are [[Penataran Temple|Panataran]] and [[Jawi temple]], although the linga is missing.\n\n=== Bas-reliefs ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016185.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rama]] killing evil giant, bas-relief of [[Ramayana]] on Prambanan temple, Central Java style.]]\n\nThe walls of ''candi'' often displayed [[bas-reliefs]], either serves as decorative elements as well as to convey religious symbolic meanings; through describing narrative bas-reliefs. The most exquisite of the temple bas-reliefs can be found in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. The first four terrace of Borobudur walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=58,6456,0,0,1,0\n| title = Temple of enlightenment\n| accessdate = 11 November 2011\n| first=Tom |last=Cockrem |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 18, 2008\n| via= The Buddhist Channel.tv\n}}\n</ref> The Buddhist scriptures describes as bas-reliefs in Borobudur such as ''Karmavibhangga'' (the law of karma), ''[[Lalitavistara S\u016btra|Lalitavistara]]'' (the birth of Buddha), ''[[Jataka]]'', ''Avadana'' and ''[[Gandavyuha]]''. While in [[Prambanan]] the Hindu scriptures is describes in its bas-relief panels; the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (popularly known as ''Krishnayana'').\n\nThe bas-reliefs in Borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also [[Indonesian architecture|native vernacular architecture]]. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as [[Asura (Buddhism)|asuras]], gods, [[boddhisattva]]s, [[kinnara]]s, [[gandharva]]s and [[apsara]]s. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also mode of transportation of 8th-century [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is [[Borobudur Ship]].\n\n[[File:Candi Panataran Ramayana Relief, Java 1302.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hanuman]] battling enemy, bas-relief of Ramayana on [[Penataran]] temple, East Java style.]]\nThere are significant distinction of bas-reliefs' style and aesthetics between the Central Javanese period (prior of 1000 CE) and East Javanese period (after 1000 CE). The earlier Central Javanese style, as observable in Borobudur and Prambanan, are more exquisite and naturalistic in style. The reliefs is projected rather high from the background, the images was done in naturalistic style with proper ideal body proportion. On the other hand, the bas-reliefs of Eastern Javanese style is projected rather flat from the background, the images was done in stiffer pose and stylized style, similar to currently Balinese wayang images. The East Javanese style is currently preserved in Balinese art, style and aesthetics in temple bas-reliefs, also [[wayang]] shadow puppet imagery, as well as the [[Kamasan]] [[Balinese art|painting]].\n\n=== Deities ===\n\n====Kalpataru and Kinnaras ====\n[[File:Kalpataru, Kinnara-Kinnari, Apsara-Devata, Pawon Temple.jpg|thumb|''[[Kinnara]]'' (male), ''Kinnari'' (female), ''[[Apsara]]'', and ''[[Devata]]'' guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'', the divine tree of life. 8th century [[Pawon]] temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]\nThe images of coupled ''[[Kinnara]]'' and ''Kinnari'' can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of ''Kinnara'' and ''Kinnari'' usually is depicted guarding ''[[Kalpataru]]'' ([[Kalpavriksha]]), the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure. There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous ''kinnari'', [[Manohara]].\n\nThe lower outer wall of [[Prambanan]] temples were adorned with row of small niche containing image of ''simha'' (lion) flanked by two panels depicting bountiful kalpataru (kalpavriksha) tree. These wish-fulfilling sacred trees according to Hindu-Buddhist beliefs, is flanked on either side by [[kinnara]]s or animals, such as pairs of birds, deer, sheep, monkeys, horses, elephants etc. The pattern of lion in niche flanked by kalpataru trees is typical in Prambanan temple compound, thus it is called as \"Prambanan panel\".\n\n==== Boddhisattva and Tara ====\n[[File:Sewu09 43.jpg|thumb|upright|A Bodhisattva flanked by two Taras in Sewu temple.]]\nIn Buddhist temples, the panels of bas-reliefs usually adorned with exquisite images of male figure of ''[[Bodhisattva]]s'' and female figure of ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]s'', along with ''[[Gandarva]]s'' heavenly musicians, and sometimes the flock of ''[[Gana]]'' dwarfs. These are the deities and divinities in Buddhist beliefs, which resides in the [[Tushita|Tushita heaven]] in Buddhism cosmology. The notable images of ''boddhisattvas'' could be found adorning outer walls of [[Plaosan]], Sari, Kalasan, Pawon and of course Borobudur temple.\n\n==== Devata and Apsara ====\n[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 05.jpg|thumb|upright|A Devata flanked by two apsaras in Prambanan temple.]]\nIn Hindu temples, the celestial couple; male ''[[Devata]]s'' and female ''[[Apsara]]s'' are usually found adorns the panels of temple's walls. They are the Hindu counterpart of Buddhist ''Bodhisattva-Tara'' celestial beings. On the other side of narrative panels in Prambanan, the temple wall along the gallery were adorned with the statues and reliefs of ''[[devata]]s'' and ''brahmin'' sages. The figure of ''[[lokapala]]s'', the celestial guardians of directions can be found in Shiva temple. The Brahmin sage editors of veda were carved on Brahma temple wall, while in Vishnu temple the figures of a male deities ''[[devata]]s'' flanked by two ''[[apsara]]s''. The depiction of celestial beings of lesser gods and goddesses \u2014 ''devatas'' and ''apsaras'', describes the Hindu concept of sacred realm of ''[[Svarga]]loka''. This is corresponds to the concept of the towering Hindu temple as the epitome of [[Mount Meru]] in Hindu cosmology.\n\n=== Guardians ===\n\n==== Dvarapala ====\n[[File:Java - Candi Sewu - 003 (8697399678).jpg|thumb|upright|left|One of dvarapala statues guarding [[Sewu]] temple.]]\nMost of larger temple compound in ancient Java were guarded by a pair of [[Dvarapala]] statues, as gate guardians. The twin giants usually placed flanked the entrance in front of the temple, or in four cardinal points. Dvarapala took form of two fierce giants or demons that ward off evil and malevolent spirits from entering the sacred temple compounds. In Central Javanese art, Dvarapala is mostly portrayed as a stout and rather chubby giant, with fierce face of glaring round goggle eyes, protruding fangs, curly hairs and moustaches, with fat and round belly. The giant usually depicted as holding [[Gada (mace)|gada]] and sometimes knives as weapon.\n\nIn East Javanese art and Balinese version however, the dvarapala usually depicted rather slender, with the exception of gigantic dvarapala of [[Singhasari]] near Malang, East Java that measures 3.7 metres tall. The most notable dvarapala statues are those of candi [[Sewu]], each pair guarding four cardinal points of the grand temple complex, making them a total eight large dvarapala statues in perfect condition. The dvarapalas of Sewu temple has become the prototype of ''[[Gupolo]]'' guardian in later Javanese art, copied as guardians in Javanese [[keraton]]s of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Another fine example is two pairs of dvarapala guarding the twin temples of [[Plaosan]].\n\n==== Lion ====\n[[File:Borobudur Lion Guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|Lion guardian of [[Borobudur]].]]\nThe statues of a pair of [[Cultural depictions of lions|lions]] (Sanskrit: ''Si\u1e41ha'', Indonesian and Javanese: ''Singa'') flanking the portal, are often placed as the guardians of ''candi'' entrance. Lions were never native to Southeast Asia in [[recorded history]]. As the result, the depiction of lions in ancient Southeast Asian art, especially in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], is far from the naturalistic style as depicted in Greek or Persian art counterparts, since the depictions were all based on perception and imagination. The cultural depictions and the reverence of lions as the noble and powerful beasts in Southeast Asia was influenced by Indian culture especially through [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism.\n\nStatues of a pair of lions often founds in temples in Southeast Asia as the gate guardians. In [[Borobudur]] Buddhist monument [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], andesite stone statues of lions guard four main entrances of Borobudur. The thrones of [[Buddha]] and [[Boddhisattva]] found in [[Kalasan]] and [[Mendut]] Buddhist temples of ancient Java depicted elephants, lions, and [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]. The statue of winged lion also found in [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]] temple [[East Java]].\n\n=== Stupa and Ratna pinnacles ===\n[[File:Borobudur-Temple-Park Indonesia Stupas-of-Borobudu-13.jpg|thumb|left|Bell-shaped perforated stupas of Borobudur.]]\nThe religions dedicated in the temples of ancient Java can be easily distinguished mainly from its pinnacles on top of the roof. Bell-shaped [[stupa]] can be found on the Buddhist temples' roof, while ratna, the pinnacle ornaments symbolize gem, mostly founds in Hindu temples.\n\nThe typical stupas in Javanese classical temple architecture is best described as those of [[Borobudur]] style; the bell-shaped stupa. The stupa in Borobudur upper round terrace of ''Arupadhatu'' consist of round lotus pedestal, gently sloped bell-shaped dome, rectangular shape on top of the dome serves as the base of hexagonal pinnacle. \n[[File:Borobudur Temple Compounds-111351.jpg|thumb|An opened stupa reveals an [[Buddharupa|image of Buddha]] on Arupadatu rounded terrace of Borobudur.]]\nEach stupa is  pierced by numerous decorative openings, either in the shape of rectangular or rhombus. Statues of the [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] sit inside the pierced stupa enclosures. Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a ''stupa'', instead of a temple. A ''stupa'' is intended as a [[shrine]] for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship.\n\nRatna pinnacle took form of a curved obtuse pyramidal shape or sometimes cylindrical, completed with several base structure or pedestals took form as some ornamental seams (Javanese:''pelipit''). It can be found as the pinnacle of both Hindu and Buddhist temples. Nevertheless, it is most prevalent in Hindu temples. The example of temple with ratna pinnacle is [[Sambisari]] and Ijo temple. In Prambanan, the stylized [[vajra]] replaced ratna as the temple's pinnacles. In later periods, the false lingga-yoni, or cube can be found in Hindu temple's roof, while cylindrical dagoba on top of Buddhist counterparts.\n\n== Location ==\n[[File:Candi Indonesia id.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of the main sites of the so-called \"[[Indonesian classical period]]\" or Hindu-Buddhist period. Black dots represent Hindu sites and red dots Buddhist sites.]]\nThe high concentration of candi can be found especially dense in [[Sleman Regency]] in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], also [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]] in [[Central Java]]; which corresponds to the historical region of [[Kedu Plain]] ([[Progo River]] valley, Temanggung-Magelang-Muntilan area) and [[Kewu Plain]] ([[Opak River]] valley, around Prambanan), the cradle of Javanese civilization. Other important sites with notable temple compounds includes [[Malang]], [[Blitar]] and [[Trowulan]] areas in [[East Java]]. [[West Java]] also contains a small number of temples such as Batujaya and Cangkuang. Outside of Java, the candi type of temple can be found in [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]], and Southern [[Kalimantan]], although they are quite scarce. In Sumatra, two exceptional sites are notable for its temple density; the [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds]] in Jambi and [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padang Lawas or Bahal complex]] in North Sumatra.\n\nThe candis might be built on plain or uneven terrain. [[Prambanan]] and [[Sewu]] temples for example, are built on even flat low-lying terrain, while the temples of [[Gedong Songo]] and [[Ijo Temple|Ijo]] are built on hill terraces on higher grounds or mountain slopes. Borobudur on the other hand is built upon a bedrock hill. The position, orientation and spatial organization of the temples within the landscape, and also their architectural designs, were determined by socio-cultural, religious and economic factors of the people, polity or the civilization that built and support them.<ref name=\"DEGROOTp2\">{{harvp|Degroot|2009|p=2}}</ref>\n\n=== Java ===\n\n==== West Java ====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cangkuang, [[Garut]] West Java]]\n* [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]], a compound of Buddhist [[Stupa]] made from red brick and mortar located at Batu Jaya, [[Karawang]], [[West Java]].

The battalion formed part of the [[Indian Corps]], which was sent to [[France]] in 1914, to shore up the British forces fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the [[First World War]].\n\nIn October 1914, the Germans launched a major offensive in northern [[Belgium]], in order to capture the vital ports of [[Boulogne]] in France and [[Nieuport]] in Belgium. In what came to be known as the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the newly arrived 129th Baluchis were rushed to the frontline to support the hard-pressed British troops. On 31 October, two companies of the Baluchis bore the brunt of the main German attack near the village of Gheluvelt in [[Hollebeke]] Sector. The out-numbered Baluchis fought gallantly but were overwhelmed after suffering heavy casualties. Sepoy Khudadad Khan\u2019s machine-gun team, along with one other, kept their guns in action throughout the day; preventing the Germans from making the final breakthrough. The other gun was disabled by a shell and eventually Khudadad Khan\u2019s own team was overrun. All the men were killed by bullets or bayonets except Khudadad Khan who, despite being badly wounded, had continued working his gun. He was left for dead by the enemy but despite his wounds he managed to crawl back to his regiment during the night. Thanks to his bravery, and that of his fellow Baluchis, the Germans were held up just long enough for Indian and British reinforcements to arrive. They strengthened the line, and prevented the German Army from reaching the vital ports. For his matchless feat of courage and gallantry, Sepoy Khudadad Khan was awarded the Victoria Cross.{{sfnp|Thatcher|1932|pp=13\u201317}}{{sfnp|Ahmed|1998|pp=173\u2013178}}\n\nKhudadad Khan retired as a [[Subedar]].

The battalion formed part of the [[Indian Corps]], which was sent to [[France]] in 1914, to shore up the British forces fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the [[First World War]].\n\nIn October 1914, the Germans launched a major offensive in northern [[Belgium]], in order to capture the vital ports of [[Boulogne]] in France and [[Nieuport]] in Belgium. In what came to be known as the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the newly arrived 129th Baluchis were rushed to the frontline to support the hard-pressed British troops. On 31 October, two companies of the Baluchis bore the brunt of the main German attack near the village of Gheluvelt in [[Hollebeke]] Sector. The out-numbered Baluchis fought gallantly but were overwhelmed after suffering heavy casualties. Sepoy Khudadad Khan\u2019s machine-gun team, along with one other, kept their guns in action throughout the day; preventing the Germans from making the final breakthrough. The other gun was disabled by a shell and eventually Khudadad Khan\u2019s own team was overrun. All the men were killed by bullets or bayonets except Khudadad Khan who, despite being badly wounded, had continued working his gun. He was left for dead by the enemy but despite his wounds he managed to crawl back to his regiment during the night. Thanks to his bravery, and that of his fellow Baluchis, the Germans were held up just long enough for Indian and British reinforcements to arrive. They strengthened the line, and prevented the German Army from reaching the vital ports. For his matchless feat of courage and gallantry, Sepoy Khudadad Khan was awarded the Victoria Cross.{{sfnp|Thatcher|1932|pp=13\u201317}}{{sfnp|Ahmed|1998|pp=173\u2013178}}\n\nKhudadad Khan retired as a [[Subedar]].

His Victoria Cross is on display at his ancestral house in Village Dab (Chakwal), Pakistan.{{refn|group=note|There is some controversy as to whether the medal on display is genuine.

The opening in the [[wall]] can be referred to as a \"portal\". A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide [[security]] by controlling access to the portal (doorway). [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], it is a panel that fits into the portal of a [[building]], [[room]], or [[vehicle]]. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform. Doors are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.\n\nThe door may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress. In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. But in other cases (e.g., a [[car door|vehicle door]]) the two sides are radically different.\n\n[[File:Clevelandart 1964.91.jpg|thumb|False door of [[Nykara]], c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 x 6 cm, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]\n\nDoors often incorporate [[lock (security device)|locking]] mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or [[doorbell]]s by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing [[light]] to pass into and out of a space, of controlling [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air draft]]s so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening [[noise]], and of blocking the spread of [[fire]].\n\nDoors may have [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic purposes. To be given the [[key (lock)|key]] to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.<ref>See, for example the doorkeeping duties of the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].</ref> Doors and doorways frequently appear in [[literature]] and [[the arts]] with [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegory|allegorical]] import as a portent of change.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section contains verbatim text from the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) article on doors. See References.-->\n\nThe earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there was no fear of their warping, but in other countries it was necessary to frame them, which according to [[Vitruvius]] (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails ''(see: [[Frame and panel]])'': the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned]] or [[hinge]]d, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails.\n\nThe most ancient doors were made of timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's temple]] being in [[olive wood]] (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in [[Homer]] appear to have been cased in silver or brass. Besides olive wood, [[elm (wood)|elm]], [[cedar (wood)|cedar]], [[oak (wood)|oak]] and [[cypress (wood)|cypress]] were used. A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ Swiss archaeologists find 5000-year-old door] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222716/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 550\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = stone door.jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Stone door in [[Hampi]] ([[India]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Door-Post Socket (4690606141).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = A massive door socket from [[Persepolis]] (modern-day [[Iran]])\n}}\n\nAll ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the [[lintel]] and [[sill plate|sill]], the latter being always in some hard stone such as [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. Those found at [[Nippur]] by Dr. Hilprecht dating from 2000 BC were in [[dolerite]]. The tenons of the [[gate]]s at [[Balawat]] were sheathed with bronze (now in the [[British Museum]]). These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; they were encased with bronze bands or strips, {{convert|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, covered with [[repouss\u00e9]] decoration of figures. The wood doors would seem to have been about {{convert|7.62|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, but the hanging stile was over {{convert|360|mm|in}} diameter. Other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found, which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots. In the [[Hauran]] in Syria, where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone, and one measuring {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.79|m|in|abbr=on}} is in the British Museum; the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door. At Kuffeir near Bostra in Syria, Burckhardt found stone doors, {{convert|2.74|to|3.048|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, being the entrance doors of the town. In [[Etruria]] many stone doors are referred to by Dennis.\n\n[[File:Plaster cast of folding doors, Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] folding doors at [[Pompeii]], from the 1st century AD, similar with Neoclassical doors from the 19th century]]\n\nAncient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] doors were either single doors, double doors, triple doors, [[sliding door]]s or [[folding door]]s, in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In [[Eumachia]], is a painting of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at [[Agrigentum]] there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a [[bas-relief]] of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano]], in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].\n\nThe Greek scholar [[Heron of Alexandria]] created the earliest known automatic door in the 1st century AD during the era of [[Roman Egypt]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 162\">Needham, Joseph.

The doors of the [[church of the Nativity]] at [[Bethlehem]] (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]], of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze, and the west doors of the cathedral of [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (9th century), of similar manufacture, were probably brought from Constantinople, as also some of those in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Marks, Venice]]. The bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 AD. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 by Ghiberti.<ref>Architecture, European Copper Institute; {{cite web |url=http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005711/http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> ''(For more information, see: [[Copper in architecture]]).''\n\n[[File:T\u00fcr, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wall painting of an ornate door, in the [[Villa Boscoreale]] ([[Italy]]), from the 1st century AD]]\n\nOf the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]] (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of [[Gniezno Doors|Gniezno door]] in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, [[Amalfi]] (1060); [[Salerno]] (1099); [[Canosa]] (1111); [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], two doors (1119 and 1124); [[Ravello]] (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for [[Trani]] cathedral; and in [[Monreale]] and [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa]] cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]]; in France the metal work of the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.\n\nReturning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)]], which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330), and of the east doorway by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] (1425\u20131452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402\u20131424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which [[Michelangelo]] speaks.\n\nThe doors of the mosques in [[Cairo]] were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being [[Copt]]ic in its origin. The doors of the palace at [[Palermo]], which were made by Saracenic workmen for the [[Normans]], are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in [[Verona]], where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433.JPG|thumb|Glass door decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] elements, from the [[Singer House]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nIn the Renaissance period the Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the contrary is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at [[Fontainebleau]], which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.\n\nThe earliest [[Renaissance]] doors in France are those of the [[Aix Cathedral|cathedral of St. Sauveur]] at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] (1503). In the lower panels there are figures {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[niche (architecture)|niches]], and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high with canopies over them, all carved in [[cedrus|cedar]]. The south door of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] is in some respects the finest in France; the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them. The doors of the church at [[Gisors]] (1575) are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed. In St. Maclou at [[Rouen]] are three magnificently carved doors; those by Jean Goujon have figures in niches on each side, and others in a group of great beauty in the center. The other doors, probably about forty to fifty years later, are enriched with [[bas-reliefs]], landscapes, figures and elaborate interlaced borders.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the Kennedy Space Center contains the four largest doors. The Vehicle Assembly Building was originally built for the assembly of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions' [[Saturn V|Saturn]] vehicles and was then used to support Space Shuttle operations. Each of the four doors are 139 meters (456 feet) high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/718659main_VAB.pdf|title=Vehicle Assembly Building Fact Sheet|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|access-date=2016-06-03|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011224909/https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/718659main_VAB.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest door in England can be found in [[Westminster Abbey]] and dates from 1050.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4743899.stm | work=BBC News | title=Abbey oak door 'Britain's oldest' | date=2005-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620190404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4743899.stm | archivedate=2006-06-20 }}</ref> In England in the 17th century the door panels were raised with [[bolection]] or projecting moldings, sometimes richly carved, round them; in the 18th century the [[molding (decorative)|moldings]] worked on the [[stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] were carved with the egg and tongue [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]].\n\n== Design and styles ==\n[[File:Floren\u00e7a - Port\u00f5es do Para\u00edso (146).jpg|thumb|250px|Door of the [[Florence Baptistery]] called ''The Gates of Paradise'', 1425\u20131452, gilded bronze, height: 5.2 m]]\n\n[[File:Kunsthistorisches Museum entrance.jpg|thumb|250px|Entrance of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]])]]\nThere are many kinds of doors, with different purposes. The most common type is the '''single-leaf door''', which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the '''double-leaf door''' or '''double door and French windows''', which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side of the doorway.\n* A '''half door''' or '''[[Dutch door]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193405/http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas/ |archivedate=2018-01-03 }} Door design ideas</ref> or '''stable door''' is divided in half horizontally. Traditionally the top half can be opened to allow a [[horse]] or other animal to be fed, while the bottom half remains closed to keep the animal inside. This style of door has been adapted for homes.\n* '''[[Western saloon|Saloon]] doors''' are a pair of lightweight swing doors often found in public bars, and especially associated with the American west. Saloon doors, also known as '''[[wikt:cafe|cafe]] doors''', often use bidirectional [[hinge]]s that close the door regardless of which direction it is opened by incorporating [[spring (device)|springs]]. Saloon doors that only extend from knee-level to chest-level are known as '''batwing doors'''.\n* A '''blind door''', '''Gibb door''', or '''jib door''' has no visible trim or operable components. It is designed to blend with the adjacent wall in all finishes, and visually to be a part of the wall, a disguised door.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Peter |title=The New and Improved Practical Builder |location=London |publisher=Thomas Kelly|date=1841 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n* A '''French door''' consists of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a '''French window''', as it resembles a door-height [[casement window]]. When a pair of French doors is used as a French window, the application does not generally include a central [[mullion]] (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An [[espagnolette]] bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.\n* A '''[[louvred door]]''' has fixed or movable wooden fins (often called slats or [[louver]]s) which permit open ventilation while preserving privacy and preventing the passage of light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for [[wardrobe]]s and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form [[window shutter]]s. Double louvred doors were introduced into ''[[Powel Crosley, Jr.#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]]'', built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy in that it is impossible to see through the fins in any direction.\n* A '''composite door''' is a single leaf door that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, it is common for composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean/|title=What does 'certificated' to PAS 24 actually mean?|work=thecrimepreventionwebsite.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223650/http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean|archivedate=2014-01-25}}</ref> and be compliant with Secured by Design, an official UK police initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doors and Locks |url=https://www.securedbydesign.com/guidance/standards-explained#doors-and-locks |website=Secured by Design |publisher=Police Crime Prevention Initiative |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n* A '''steel security door''' is one which is made from strong steel, often for use on [[Bank vault|vaults]] and [[safe room]]s to withstand attack. These may also be fitted with wooden outer panels to resemble standard internal and external doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|title=Henleys Security Doors|website=Henleys Security Doors|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035319/http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A '''flush door''' is a completely smooth door, having [[plywood]] or [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, the first of which was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called [[Masonite]], its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.\n* A '''moulded door''' has the same structure as that of flush door. The only difference is that the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of [[Masonite|hardboards]].\n* A '''ledge and brace door''' often called board and batten doors are made from multiple vertical boards fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges (or battens)and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.\n* A '''[[wicket gate|wicket door]]''' is a pedestrian door built into a much larger door allowing access without requiring the opening of the larger door. Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.\n* A '''bifold door'''<span id=\"bifold\"></span><!-- The preceding tag is a target for links on other pages, probably including the Dab [[Folding]]. --> is a unit that has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood is the most common material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most commonly made for [[closet]]s, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|title=Front Doors, Garage Doors Insights from The Door Zone|website=The Door Zone|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507074631/http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|archivedate=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n* A '''[[sliding glass door]]''', sometimes called an Arcadia door or patio door, is a door made of [[glass]] that slides open and sometimes has a screen (a removable metal mesh that covers the door).\n* '''Australian doors''' are a pair of plywood swinging doors often found in Australian public houses. These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.\n* A '''false door''' is a wall decoration that looks like a window. In ancient [[Egyptian architecture]], this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife. They can also be found in the funerary architecture of the desert tribes (e.g., [[Libya]]n Ghirza).\n* A '''[[Mat|doormat]]''' (also called door mat) is a mat placed typically in front of or behind a door of a home. This practice originated so that mud and dirt would be less prevalent on floors inside a building.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nFile:Zesp\u00f3\u0142 klasztoru Gandan (39).jpg|A decorated door from the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] (Mongolia)\n\nFile:Tsentralny District, St Petersburg, Russia - panoramio (259).jpg|[[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] door from [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia)\n\nFile:Bohemian court chancellery door - Vienna.jpg|[[Baroque]] entrance in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]])\n\nFile:Maison Huot de style art nouveau (Nancy) (7965996816).jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] door from France\n\nFile:Amsterdam (NL), Kloveniersburgwal -- 2015 -- 7252.jpg|Door of the Laboratorium voor Artsenijbereidkunde, an example of Dutch [[Renaissance architecture]], in [[Amsterdam]] (the [[Netherlands]])\n\nFile:Porte d'entr\u00e9e du palais de Justice de Bruxelles (HDR) - 2043-0077-0.jpg|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] door of the main entrance of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] ([[Brussels]], Belgium)\n\nFile:Brooklyn Museum 1994.92 Door with Lock (2).jpg|Door with lock, late 19th or early 20th century, wood with iron, from [[Burkina Faso]], in the [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n\nBronze door, Basilica di San Giovanni, 2013.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] bronze doors of the [[Curia Julia]], now in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (Rome)\n\nFile:Door in Morocco, 2010.jpg|An Islamic door decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], in [[Morocco]]\n\nPorte et marquise CCI Nancy.jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] metal and glass door in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (France), with a big transparent [[awning]] above it\n\nSimple door inside the BCR Headquarters Building, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|Neoclassical door in the BCR Headquarters Building from [[Bucharest]] (Romania)\n\nFile:Tenghua Jiuguan 21 2015-04.JPG|Traditional folding doors in [[The Old Museum of Wisteria]] ([[Changzhou]], China)\n</gallery>\n\n== Different types of door mechanism ==\n[[File:Types of doors.png|thumb|The main types of door mechanisms]]\n\n=== Hinged doors ===\nMost doors are [[hinge]]d along one side to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of rotation is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged [[garage door]]s, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.\n\nDoors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.\n\nA '''swing door''' has special single-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.\n\n'''French doors''' are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.\n\nA '''Mead door''', developed by S Mead of Leicester, swings both ways. It is susceptible to forced entry due to its design.\n\nA '''Dutch door''' or stable door consists of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has a lip on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.\n\nA '''garden door''' resembles a French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an [[espagnolette]] bolt.\n\n=== Sliding doors ===\nIt is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks, often for space or aesthetic considerations.\n\nA '''bypass door''' is a door unit that has two or more sections. The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.\n\nDoors which slide inside a wall cavity are called '''[[pocket door]]s'''. This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required. The door slab is mounted to roller and a track at the top of the door and slides inside a wall.\n\nSliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the \"active leaf\", while the door that remains fixed is called the \"inactive leaf\".\n\n=== Rotating doors ===\nA '''[[revolving door]]''' has several wings or leaves, generally four, radiating from a central shaft, forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis. A revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding, and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out.\n\nA '''pivot door''', instead of hinges, is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge, so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.\n\n=== High-speed door ===\nA '''[[high-speed door]]''' is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4&nbsp;m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded.\n\nHigh-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200,000 a year. They need to be built with heavy-duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the [[Green energy|Green]] and [[Energy saving]] requirements.\n\nIn North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508&nbsp;mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.\n\n=== Automatic ===\n'''[[Automatic door|Automatically opening doors]]''' are powered open and closed either by electricity, spring, or both. There are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated:\n\n# A [[sensor]] detects traffic is approaching. Sensors for automatic doors are generally:\n#* A [[pressure sensor]] \u2013 e.g., a floor mat which reacts to the pressure of someone standing on it.\n#* An [[infrared]] [[curtain]] or beam which shines invisible light onto sensors; if someone or something blocks the beam the door is triggered open.\n#* A [[motion sensor]] which uses low-power microwave [[radar]] for the same effect.\n#* A remote sensor (e.g. based on infrared or radio waves) can be triggered by a portable [[remote control]], or is installed inside a vehicle. These are popular for garage doors.\n# A [[switch]] is operated manually, perhaps after security checks. This can be a push button switch or a swipe card.\n# The act of pushing or pulling the door triggers the open and close cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.\n\nIn addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Image:Puertas seccionales.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Sectional doors for industry.]]\n[[File:Torggler evolutiondoor.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|''Evolution Door'', 2013]]\n'''Up-and-over''' or '''overhead''' doors are often used in garages. Instead of hinges it has a mechanism, often [[counterbalance]]d or [[torsion spring|sprung]], that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening. A [[roller shutter]] or '''sectional overhead door''' is one variant of this type.\n\nA '''[[tambour door]]''' or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and \"rolls\" up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets.\n\n'''Inward opening doors''' are doors that can only be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.\n\n'''Rebated doors''', a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a [[Rabbet]]) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile, in accordance with the American [[Fire door]].\n\n'''Evolution Door''' is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. It is a further development of the '''{{ill|Drehplattent\u00fcr|de|Drehplattent\u00fcr|vertical-align=sup}}''' that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|title=Kinematics with MicroStation Ch01C-I Grueblers Criteria for 3D 5 Bar|date=20 February 2014|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090618/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Miersch, 17 rue Nicolas Welter-001.jpg|thumb|250px|Transparent awning in [[Luxembourg]]]]\nArchitectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for [[convenience]], [[privacy]], [[safety]], and [[security]] reasons. Doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior, for reasons of [[climate]] control and safety.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDoors also are applied in more specialized cases:\n* A '''[[blast door|Blast-proof door]]''' is constructed to allow access to a structure as well as to provide protection from the force of explosions.\n* A '''garden door''' is any door that opens to a backyard or [[garden]]. This term is often used specifically for French windows, double French doors (with lites instead of panels), in place of a [[sliding glass door]]. The term also may refer to what is known as ''patio doors''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A jib door is a concealed door, whose surface reflects the moldings and finishes of the wall. These were used in historic English houses, mainly as servants' doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* A '''[[pet door]]''' (also known as a [[cat flap]] or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a [[rubber]] flap, or it may be an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only allowing pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.\n* A '''[[trapdoor]]''' is a door that is oriented horizontally in a [[ceiling]] or [[floor]], often accessed via a [[ladder]].\n* A '''water door''' or '''water entrance''', such as those used in [[Venice, Italy]], is a door leading from a building built on the water, such as a canal, to the water itself where, for example, one may enter or exit a private boat or [[water taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|website=See Venice, Italy|title=Doors in Venice: among water, art and architecture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074300/http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>Water doors make frequent appearances in [[Donna Leon]]'s books, and in some are important plot devices, as in [[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|''Acqua Alta'' aka ''Death in High Water'' (1996) and ''Beastly Things'' (2012)]].</ref>\n\n== Construction and components ==\n[[File:Door-glossary.png|thumb|Parts of a panel or glazed door]]\n[[File:Door-midrail-detail.png|thumb|Joint between midrail, lockrail and a gunstock stile]]\n[[File:Frame-filled-door.gif|thumb|A frame and filled door]]\n[[File:hollow door.jpg|thumb|A hollow door with one face removed]]\n\n=== Panel doors ===\nPanel doors, also called stile and rail doors, are built with [[frame and panel]] construction. EN 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in European Member States. The main parts are listed below:\n* [[Stile]]s \u2013 Vertical boards that run the full height of a door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the fixed side (known as the \"hanging stile\"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the swinging side (known as the \"latch stile\").\n* [[Frame and panel|Rails]] \u2013 Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and optionally in the middle of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The \"top rail\" and \"bottom rail\" are named for their positions. The bottom rail is also known as \"kick rail\". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the \"lock rail\", other middle rails are commonly known as \"cross rails\".\n* [[Mullion]]s \u2013 Smaller optional vertical boards that run between two rails, and split the door into two or more columns of panels, the term is used sometimes for verticals in doors, but more often (UK and Australia) it refers to verticals in windows.\n* Muntin \u2013 Optional vertical members that divide the door into smaller panels.\n* Panels \u2013 Large, wider boards used to fill the space between the stiles, rails, and mullions. The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid. Panels may be flat, or in raised panel designs. Can be glued in or stay as a floating panel.\n* Light \u2013 a piece of glass used in place of a panel, essentially giving the door a window.\n\n=== Board batten doors ===\nAlso known as ledges and braced,\nBoard and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats:\n* Planks \u2013 Boards wider than 9\" that extend the full height of the door, and are placed side by side filling the door's width.\n* Ledges and braces \u2013 Ledges extend horizontally across the door which the boards are affixed to. The ledges hold the planks together. When diagonally they are called braces which prevent the door from skewing. On some doors, especially antique ones, the ledges are replaced with iron bars that are often built into the hinges as extensions of the door-side plates.\n\n=== Ledged and braced doors ===\nAs board and Batten doors\n\n=== Impact-resistant doors ===\nImpact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping, scratching and denting. The formed edges are often made of an engineered material. Impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals, schools, hotels and coastal areas.\n\n=== Frame and filled doors ===\nThis type consists of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with Tongue and Grooved boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.\n\n=== Flush doors ===\nMany modern doors, including most interior doors, are flush doors:\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* Core material: Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce drumminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core flush doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board and batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are then covered with [[wood veneer]], thin [[plywood]], [[sheet metal]], [[fiberglass]], or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]]. The wooden materials are usually layered with the grain alternating direction between layers to prevent warping. Fiberglass and metal-faced doors are sometimes given a layer of cellulose so that they may be stained to look like wood.\n\n=== Moulded doors ===\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* '''Core material''': Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce druminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], extruded polystyrene foam, or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core molded doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board & batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are covered with HDF / [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] skins.\n\n=== Swing direction ===\n'''Door swings'''\n[[File:Art Nouveau entrance in Pia\u021ba Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Square), from Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Nouveau]] door in [[Bucharest]] (Romania), with a [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it]]\nFor most of the world {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, door swings, or handing, are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).\n\nIt is especially important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain. In some custom [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding. Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time-consuming. In North America, many doors now come with factory-installed hinges, pre-hung on the jamb and sills.\n\nWhile facing the door from the outside or less secure side, if the hinge is on the right side of the door, the door is \"right handed\"; or if the hinge is on the left, it is \"left handed\". If the door swings toward you, it is \"reverse swing\"; or if the door swings away from you, it is \"Normal swing\".\n\nIn other words,\n*In the United States:\n** '''Left hand hinge (LHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side, or on the public side of the door), the hinges are on the left and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Right hand hinge (RHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Left hand reverse (LHR):''' Standing outside the house (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the left, knob on right, on opening the door it swings towards you (i.e. the door swings open towards the outside, or \"outswing\")\n** '''Right hand reverse (RHR):''' Standing outside the house (i.e. on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right, knob on left, opening the door by pulling the door towards you (i.e. open swings to the outside, or \"outswing\")\n*In Europe:\nOne of the oldest [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] standard applies: DIN 107 \"Building construction; identification of right and left side\" (first 1922\u201305, current 1974-04) defines that '''doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen'''. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as [[mortise lock]]s (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 \"Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology\" includes these definitions of orientation.\n*In Australia:\nThe \"refrigerator rule\" applies, and a refrigerator door is not opened from the inside. If the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand (or right hung) door. (Australian Standards for Installation of Timber Doorsets, AS 1909\u20131984 pg 6.)\n\nIn public buildings, exterior doors should open to the outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction. If the door opens inward and there is a fire, there can be a crush of people who run for the door and they will not be able to open it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|title=Why do the entry doors to most homes open inward, while in most public buildings, the entry doors open outward?|date=2001-03-02|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044229/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|archivedate=2017-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nNew exterior doors are largely defined by the type of materials they are made from: [[wood]], [[steel]], [[fiberglass]], [[UPVC]]/vinyl, [[aluminum]], composite, [[Glass|glass (patio doors)]]...\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 =Strasbourg 1 rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Castelnau (2).jpg \n| width1 = 140\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Wooden door of a building from [[Strasbourg]] (France), decorated with [[pediment]]s on it\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Pierre Rousseau - Double-Leaf Doors - 1942.2.12.a - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] double-leaf doors by [[Pierre Rousseau]], 1790s\n}}\n[[File:Glass and metal door on Calea Victoriei (Victory's Avenue) in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Glass and metal door, decoarted with Neoclassical ornaments, in [[Bucharest]] (Romania)]]\n'''Wooden doors''' \u2013 including solid wood doors \u2013 are a top choice for many homeowners, largely because of the aesthetic qualities of wood. Many wood doors are custom-made, but they have several downsides: their price, their maintenance requirements (regular painting and staining) and their limited insulating value<ref>Exterior Doors; Energy.gov; {{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304181502/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |archivedate=2015-03-04 }}</ref> (R-5 to R-6, not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors). Wood doors often have an overhang requirement to maintain a warranty. An overhang is a roof, porch area or awning that helps to protect the door and its finish from [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.\n\n'''Steel doors''' are another major type of residential front doors; most of them come with a [[polyurethane]] or other type of [[foam]] insulation core \u2013 a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency. Steel doors mostly in default comes along with frame and lock system, which is a high cost efficiency factor compared to ''Wooden doors''\n\nMost modern exterior walls are designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], which can be indicated by the [[Energy Star]] label or the [[Passive House]] standards. Premium '''composite''' (including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam), '''fiberglass''' and '''vinyl doors''' benefit from the materials they are made from, from a thermal perspective.\n\n=== Insulation and weatherstrips ===\n{{Context|section|date=November 2015}}\nBut there are very few door models with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] close to 10 (which is far less than the R-40 walls or the R-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings \u2013 [[Passive Solar]] and [[Zero-energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]). Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.\n\nMany doors may have good R-values at their center, but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor [[weatherstripping]] and the way the door is manufactured.\n\nDoor weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe standard door sizes in the US run along 2\" increments. Customary sizes have a height of 78\" (1981&nbsp;mm) or 80\" (2032&nbsp;mm) and a width of 18\" (472&nbsp;mm), 24\" (610&nbsp;mm), 26\" (660&nbsp;mm), 28\" (711&nbsp;mm), 30\" (762&nbsp;mm) or 36\" (914&nbsp;mm).<ref>options at homedepot.com</ref> Most residential passage (room to room) doors are 30\" x 80\" (762&nbsp;mm x 2032&nbsp;mm).\n\nA standard US residential (exterior) door size is 36\" x 80\" (91 x 203&nbsp;cm). Interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0\" (91&nbsp;cm). Residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8\" high, as are many small stores, offices, and other light commercial buildings. Larger commercial, public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height. Older buildings often have smaller doors.\n\nThickness: Most pre-fabricated doors are 1 3/8\" thick (for interior doors) or 1 3/4\" (exterior).\n\n'''Closets:''' small spaces such as closets, dressing rooms, half-baths, storage rooms, cellars, etc. often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design.\n\n'''Garages:''' Garage doors are generally 7'-0\" or 8'-0\" wide for a single-car opening. Two car garage doors (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0\". Because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing. There are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes. circa 1950's\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe standard DIN doors are defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955\u201307, 1985\u201301, 2014-08). The door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006\u201307, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the [[CE marking]] giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.\n\nThe DIN 18101 standard has a normative size (Nennma\u00df) slightly larger than the panel size (T\u00fcrblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985&nbsp;mm (normativ height 2010&nbsp;mm) at panel widths of 610&nbsp;mm, 735&nbsp;mm, 860&nbsp;mm, 985&nbsp;mm, 1110&nbsp;mm, plus a larger door panel size of 1110&nbsp;mm x 2110&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|title=T\u00fcrblattgr\u00f6\u00dfen nach DIN 18101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203924/http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|archivedate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125&nbsp;mm increments where the height and width are independent.

When a door has more than one movable section, one of the sections may be called a ''leaf''. See [[door furniture]] for a discussion of attachments to doors such as [[door handle]]s, [[doorknob]]s, and [[door knocker]]s.\n* [[Lintel]] \u2013 A horizontal beam above a door that supports the wall above it. (Also known as a ''header'')\n* [[Jamb]]s or legs \u2013 The vertical posts that form the sides of a door frame, where the hinges are mounted, and with which the bolt interacts.\n* Sill (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal [[sill plate]] below the door that supports the door frame. Similar to a [[Window Sill]] but for a door\n* [[Threshold (door)|Threshold]] (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal plate below the door that bridges the crack between the interior floor and the sill.\n* [[Doorstop]] \u2013 a thin slat built inside the frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed, an act which might break the hinges.\n* [[Architrave]] \u2013 The decorative [[molding (decorative)|molding]] that outlines a door frame. (called an [[Archivolt]] if the door is arched). Called ''door casing'' or ''brickmold'' in North America.\n\n=== Related hardware ===\n{{Main|Door furniture}}\n[[File:Door lock.jpg|thumb|Front door of a house with typical [[door furniture]]: a [[letter box]], [[door knocker]], a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] and two [[Lock (security device)|locks]]]]\n[[File:Paris Rue de Douai5134.JPG|thumb|A door knocker with [[putti]]s holding a [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]], in Paris]]\n\nDoor furniture or hardware refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance. This includes items such as hinges, handles, door stops, etc.\n\n== Related accidents ==\n'''Door safety''' relates to prevention of door-related [[accident]]s. Such accidents take place in various forms, and in a number of locations; ranging from car doors to garage doors. Accidents vary in severity and frequency. According to the [[National Safety Council]] in the [[United States]], 300,000 injuries are caused by doors every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|title=Protecting Children\u2019s Fingers from Door Injuries|work=The Redwoods Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033919/http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects, such as walls, to serious cases resulting in human injury, particularly to fingers, hands, and feet. A closing door can exert up to 40 [[ton]]s per square inch of [[pressure]] between the [[hinge]]s. Because of the number of accidents taking place, there has been a surge in the number of [[lawsuit]]s. Thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected.\n\nAccording to the US [[General Services Administration]], discussing child care centres:\n{{quote|...It is essential that children's fingers be protected from being crushed or otherwise injured in the hinge space of a swinging door or gate. There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring that this type of injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety...<ref>USA General Services Administration Child Care Center Design Guide, June 1998</ref>}}\n\n=== Outward and inward opening ===\nWhenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person. In many cases this can be avoided by [[architectural design]] which favors doors which open inwards into rooms (from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor, the door opens outwards). In cases where this is infeasible, it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing [[vision panel]]s in the door.<ref>Home Safety Guidelines for Architects & Builders, NBS GCR 78-156, BOSTI, December 1978</ref>\n\nHowever, inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside the building may press against the doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. Related accidents include:\n* [[Grue Church fire]] - Grue, Norway in 1822\n* [[Victoria Hall Disaster]] - Sunderland, UK in 1883\n* [[Glen Cinema disaster]] - Paisley, UK in 1929\n* [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] - Boston, USA in 1942\n\nToday, the exterior doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, as do many exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.\n\n=== Doorstops ===\n[[Doorstop]]s are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall). Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.\n\n=== Door guards ===\nThe purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.\n\nThere are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.\nWhich level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a [[risk assessment]] of the door.\n\nThere is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.\n\n=== Safety doors ===\nA safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards. Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (\"bull-nose\" shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes. This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges \u2013 either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a [[doorstop]]).\n\n=== Glass doors ===\n[[Arcadia door|Glass doors]] pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, [[sticker]]s or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated, tempered or toughened glass.\n\n=== Fire ===\n{{Main|Fire door}}\n\nSpecial purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire, particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke. In cases where they are improperly installed, employed, or tampered with, the risk of fire can be increased. [[Door closer]]s are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed.\n\nAn additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to [[emergency service]]s personnel in order to fight the fire, rescue occupants, etc. [[Door breaching]] techniques may be required in these situations to gain access.\n\n[[Panic bar]]s are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n=== Vehicle doors ===\n{{Main|Vehicle door}}\nThere may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors, due to the proximity in which the occupant sits. In some car accidents, injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nBicyclists cycling on public roads fear [[dooring]]: collision with an abruptly opened vehicle door. Because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n=== Aircraft doors ===\nDoors which lead from interior, pressurized, sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure \u2013 most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.\n\nA number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight, often accidentally:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972)\n* [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974)\n* [[United Airlines Flight 811]] (1989)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Hinge bender]], a tool for adjusting door hinges\n* [[Biometrics]]\n* [[Closed-circuit television]]\n* [[Coal hole]]\n* [[Door security]]\n* [[Double margin doors]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Identity document]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Janus]], Roman god of doors\n* [[Keycard]]s\n* [[Locksmithing]]\n* [[Lock picking]]\n* [[Logical security]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911 |last=Spiers |first=Richard Phen\u00e9 |wstitle=Door |volume=8 |pages=419\u2013420}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Doors}}\n{{Room}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Doors| ]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Doors|the band|The Doors|other uses|Door (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=600\n| image1 = 57 Rue du Faubourg de Pierre (27353042388).jpg\n| image2 = Pair of door panels and lintel Yoruba BM.jpg\n| image3 = P1250574 Paris V rue Malebranche n3 porte gothique bis encours.jpg\n| image4 = Qila-i-Kuhna mosque side door.jpg\n| image5 = 16, Stationsstraat, Maastricht.jpg|width5=300|height5=\n| image6 = The Marble Temple-Door (Bangkok).jpg\n| footer = Various examples of doors throughout history\n}}\n\nA '''door''' is a [[Hinge|hinged]] or otherwise movable barrier that allows ingress and egress into an \"enclosure\". The opening in the [[wall]] can be referred to as a \"portal\". A door's essential and primary purpose is to provide [[security]] by controlling access to the portal (doorway). [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], it is a panel that fits into the portal of a [[building]], [[room]], or [[vehicle]]. Doors are generally made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform.  Doors are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.\n\nThe door may be moved in various ways (at angles away from the portal, by sliding on a plane parallel to the frame, by folding in angles on a parallel plane, or by spinning along an axis at the center of the frame) to allow or prevent ingress or egress.  In most cases, a door's interior matches its exterior side. But in other cases (e.g., a [[car door|vehicle door]]) the two sides are radically different.\n\n[[File:Clevelandart 1964.91.jpg|thumb|False door of [[Nykara]], c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 x 6 cm, [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]]]\n\nDoors often incorporate [[lock (security device)|locking]] mechanisms to ensure that only some people can open them. Doors can have devices such as knockers or [[Doorbell|doorbells]] by which people outside can announce their presence and summon someone either to open the door for them or give permission to open and enter. Apart from providing access into and out of a space, doors can have the secondary functions of ensuring privacy by preventing unwanted attention from outsiders, of separating areas with different functions, of allowing [[light]] to pass into and out of a space, of controlling [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air draft]]s so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled, of dampening [[noise]], and of blocking the spread of [[fire]].\n\nDoors may have [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[symbol]]ic, [[ritual]]istic purposes. To be given the [[key (lock)|key]] to a door can signify a change in status from outsider to insider.<ref>See, for example the doorkeeping duties of the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].</ref> Doors and doorways frequently appear in [[literature]] and [[the arts]] with [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegory|allegorical]] import as a portent of change.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section contains verbatim text from the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' (1911) article on doors. See References.-->\n\nThe earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. In Egypt, where the climate is intensely dry, there was no fear of their warping, but in other countries it was necessary to frame them, which according to [[Vitruvius]] (iv. 6.) was done with stiles (sea/si) and rails ''(see: [[Frame and panel]])'': the spaces enclosed being filled with panels (tympana) let into grooves made in the stiles and rails. The stiles were the vertical boards, one of which, [[Mortise and tenon|tenoned]] or [[hinge]]d, is known as the hanging stile, the other as the middle or meeting stile. The horizontal cross pieces are the top rail, bottom rail, and middle or intermediate rails. \n\nThe most ancient doors were made of timber, such as those referred to in the Biblical depiction of [[Solomon's Temple|King Solomon's temple]] being in [[olive wood]] (I Kings vi. 31-35), which were carved and overlaid with gold. The doors dwelt upon in [[Homer]] appear to have been cased in silver or brass.  Besides olive wood, [[elm (wood)|elm]], [[cedar (wood)|cedar]], [[oak (wood)|oak]] and [[cypress (wood)|cypress]] were used.  A 5,000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ Swiss archaeologists find 5000-year-old door] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108222716/http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/10/20/swiss_archaeologists_find_5000_year_old_door/ |date=2010-11-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 550\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = stone door.jpg\n| width1 =\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Stone door in [[Hampi]] ([[India]])\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Door-Post Socket (4690606141).jpg\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = A massive door socket from [[Persepolis]] (modern-day [[Iran]])\n}}\n\nAll ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the [[lintel]] and [[sill plate|sill]], the latter being always in some hard stone such as [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. Those found at [[Nippur]] by Dr. Hilprecht dating from 2000 BC were in [[dolerite]]. The tenons of the [[gate]]s at [[Balawat]] were sheathed with bronze (now in the [[British Museum]]). These doors or gates were hung in two leaves, each about {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; they were encased with bronze bands or strips, {{convert|25.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, covered with [[repouss\u00e9]] decoration of figures. The wood doors would seem to have been about {{convert|7.62|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, but the hanging stile was over {{convert|360|mm|in}} diameter. Other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found, which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots. In the [[Hauran]] in Syria, where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone, and one measuring {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.79|m|in|abbr=on}} is in the British Museum; the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door. At Kuffeir near Bostra in Syria, Burckhardt found stone doors, {{convert|2.74|to|3.048|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, being the entrance doors of the town. In [[Etruria]] many stone doors are referred to by Dennis.\n\n[[File:Plaster cast of folding doors, Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] folding doors at [[Pompeii]], from the 1st century AD, similar with Neoclassical doors from the 19th century]]\n\nAncient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] doors were either single doors, double doors, triple doors, [[sliding door]]s or [[folding door]]s, in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back. In [[Eumachia]], is a painting of a door with three leaves. In the tomb of Theron at [[Agrigentum]] there is a single four-panel door carved in stone. In the Blundell collection is a [[bas-relief]] of a temple with double doors, each leaf with five panels. Among existing examples, the bronze doors in the [[Santi Cosma e Damiano|church of SS. Cosmas and Damiano]], in Rome, are important examples of Roman metal work of the best period; they are in two leaves, each with two panels, and are framed in bronze. Those of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] are similar in design, with narrow horizontal panels in addition, at the top, bottom and middle. Two other bronze doors of the Roman period are in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Lateran Basilica]].\n\nThe Greek scholar [[Heron of Alexandria]] created the earliest known automatic door in the 1st century AD during the era of [[Roman Egypt]].<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 162\">Needham, Joseph.

The doors of the [[church of the Nativity]] at [[Bethlehem]] (6th century) are covered with plates of bronze, cut out in patterns. Those of [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]], of the 8th and 9th century, are wrought in bronze, and the west doors of the cathedral of [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (9th century), of similar manufacture, were probably brought from Constantinople, as also some of those in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Marks, Venice]]. The bronze doors on the Aachen Cathedral in Germany date back to about 800 AD. Bronze baptistery doors at the Cathedral of Florence were completed in 1423 by Ghiberti.<ref>Architecture, European Copper Institute; {{cite web |url=http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005711/http://eurocopper.org/copper/copper-architecture.html |archivedate=2012-10-09 }}</ref> ''(For more information, see: [[Copper in architecture]]).''\n\n[[File:T\u00fcr, Villa Boscoreale.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] wall painting of an ornate door, in the [[Villa Boscoreale]] ([[Italy]]), from the 1st century AD]]\n\nOf the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors, the earliest being one at [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]] (1015). The Hildesheim design affected the concept of [[Gniezno Doors|Gniezno door]] in Poland. Of others in South Italy and Sicily, the following are the finest: in Sant Andrea, [[Amalfi]] (1060); [[Salerno]] (1099); [[Canosa]] (1111); [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], two doors (1119 and 1124); [[Ravello]] (1179), by Barisano of Trani, who also made doors for [[Trani]] cathedral; and in [[Monreale]] and [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa]] cathedrals, by Bonano of Pisa. In all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom. The exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known, but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors, viz, with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design. As a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges, which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame. There is an early example of the 12th century in [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]]; in France the metal work of the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] at Paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution, but examples are endless throughout France and England.\n\nReturning to Italy, the most celebrated doors are those of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)]], which together with the door frames are all in bronze, the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable: the modeling of the figures, birds and foliage of the south doorway, by [[Andrea Pisano]] (1330), and of the east doorway by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] (1425\u20131452), are of great beauty; in the north door (1402\u20131424) Ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as Andrea Pisano, but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled, with bas-reliefs, in which Scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures, these being probably the gates of Paradise of which [[Michelangelo]] speaks.\n\nThe doors of the mosques in [[Cairo]] were of two kinds; those which, externally, were cased with sheets of bronze or iron, cut out in decorative patterns, and incised or inlaid, with bosses in relief; and those in wood, which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond, this latter description of work being [[Copt]]ic in its origin. The doors of the palace at [[Palermo]], which were made by Saracenic workmen for the [[Normans]], are fine examples and in good preservation. A somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in [[Verona]], where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435\u0440, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433.JPG|thumb|Glass door decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] elements, from the [[Singer House]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], Russia)]]\n\nIn the Renaissance period the Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect; but in France and Germany the contrary is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, especially in the [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, the doorway being in plain masonry. While in Italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels, in France the contrary seems to have been the rule; and one of the great doors at [[Fontainebleau]], which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.\n\nThe earliest [[Renaissance]] doors in France are those of the [[Aix Cathedral|cathedral of St. Sauveur]] at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]] (1503). In the lower panels there are figures {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[niche (architecture)|niches]], and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. high with canopies over them, all carved in [[cedrus|cedar]]. The south door of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] is in some respects the finest in France; the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them. The doors of the church at [[Gisors]] (1575) are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed. In St. Maclou at [[Rouen]] are three magnificently carved doors; those by Jean Goujon have figures in niches on each side, and others in a group of great beauty in the center. The other doors, probably about forty to fifty years later, are enriched with [[bas-reliefs]], landscapes, figures and elaborate interlaced borders.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the Kennedy Space Center contains the four largest doors. The Vehicle Assembly Building was originally built for the assembly of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions' [[Saturn V|Saturn]] vehicles and was then used to support Space Shuttle operations.

The most common type is the '''single-leaf door''', which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the '''double-leaf door''' or '''double door and French windows''', which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side of the doorway.\n* A '''half door''' or '''[[Dutch door]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103193405/http://www.timesnews.co.uk/door-design-ideas/ |archivedate=2018-01-03 }} Door design ideas</ref> or '''stable door''' is divided in half horizontally. Traditionally the top half can be opened to allow a [[horse]] or other animal to be fed, while the bottom half remains closed to keep the animal inside. This style of door has been adapted for homes.\n* '''[[Western saloon|Saloon]] doors''' are a pair of lightweight swing doors often found in public bars, and especially associated with the American west. Saloon doors, also known as '''[[wikt:cafe|cafe]] doors''', often use bidirectional [[hinge]]s that close the door regardless of which direction it is opened by incorporating [[spring (device)|springs]]. Saloon doors that only extend from knee-level to chest-level are known as '''batwing doors'''.\n* A '''blind door''', '''Gibb door''', or '''jib door''' has no visible trim or operable components. It is designed to blend with the adjacent wall in all finishes, and visually to be a part of the wall, a disguised door.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=Peter |title=The New and Improved Practical Builder |location=London |publisher=Thomas Kelly|date=1841 |pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n* A '''French door''' consists of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a '''French window''', as it resembles a door-height [[casement window]]. When a pair of French doors is used as a French window, the application does not generally include a central [[mullion]] (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An [[espagnolette]] bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.\n* A '''[[louvred door]]''' has fixed or movable wooden fins (often called slats or [[louver]]s) which permit open ventilation while preserving privacy and preventing the passage of light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for [[wardrobe]]s and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form [[window shutter]]s. Double louvred doors were introduced into ''[[Powel Crosley, Jr.#Seagate in Florida|Seagate]]'', built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy in that it is impossible to see through the fins in any direction.\n\n* A '''composite door''' is a single leaf door that can be solid or with glass, and is usually filled with high density foam. In the United Kingdom, it is common for composite doors to be certified to BS PAS 23/24<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean/|title=What does 'certificated' to PAS 24 actually mean?|work=thecrimepreventionwebsite.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223650/http://thecrimepreventionwebsite.com/pas-242012-enhanced-security-doorsets/573/what-does-certificated-to-pas-24-actually-mean|archivedate=2014-01-25}}</ref> and be compliant with Secured by Design, an official UK police initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doors and Locks |url=https://www.securedbydesign.com/guidance/standards-explained#doors-and-locks |website=Secured by Design |publisher=Police Crime Prevention Initiative |accessdate=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n* A '''steel security door''' is one which is made from strong steel, often for use on [[Bank vault|vaults]] and [[safe room]]s to withstand attack. These may also be fitted with wooden outer panels to resemble standard internal and external doors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|title=Henleys Security Doors|website=Henleys Security Doors|access-date=25 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530035319/http://henleyssecuritydoors.co.uk/|archivedate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n* A '''flush door''' is a completely smooth door, having [[plywood]] or [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of hardboards, the first of which was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called [[Masonite]], its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.\n* A '''moulded door''' has the same structure as that of flush door. The only difference is that the surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of [[Masonite|hardboards]].\n* A '''ledge and brace door''' often called board and batten doors are made from multiple vertical boards fixed together by two or more horizontal timbers called ledges (or battens)and sometimes kept square by additional diagonal timbers called braces.\n* A '''[[wicket gate|wicket door]]''' is a pedestrian door built into a much larger door allowing access without requiring the opening of the larger door.  Examples might be found on the ceremonial door of a cathedral or in a large vehicle door in a garage or hangar.\n* A '''bifold door'''<span id=\"bifold\"></span><!-- The preceding tag is a target for links on other pages, probably including the Dab [[Folding]]. --> is a unit that has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood is the most common material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most commonly made for [[closet]]s, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|title=Front Doors, Garage Doors Insights from The Door Zone|website=The Door Zone|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507074631/http://www.thedoorzone.co.uk/|archivedate=2017-05-07}}</ref>\n* A '''[[sliding glass door]]''', sometimes called an Arcadia door or patio door, is a door made of [[glass]] that slides open and sometimes has a screen (a removable metal mesh that covers the door).\n* '''Australian doors''' are a pair of plywood swinging doors often found in Australian public houses. These doors are generally red or brown in color and bear a resemblance to the more formal doors found in other British Colonies' public houses.\n* A '''false door''' is a wall decoration that looks like a window. In ancient [[Egyptian architecture]], this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife. They can also be found in the funerary architecture of the desert tribes (e.g., [[Libya]]n Ghirza).\n* A '''[[Mat|doormat]]''' (also called door mat) is a mat placed typically in front of or behind a door of a home. This practice originated so that mud and dirt would be less prevalent on floors inside a building.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nFile:Zesp\u00f3\u0142 klasztoru Gandan (39).jpg|A decorated door from the [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] (Mongolia)\n\nFile:Tsentralny District, St Petersburg, Russia - panoramio (259).jpg|[[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] door from [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia)\n\nFile:Bohemian court chancellery door - Vienna.jpg|[[Baroque]] entrance in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]])\n\nFile:Maison Huot de style art nouveau (Nancy) (7965996816).jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] door from France\n\nFile:Amsterdam (NL), Kloveniersburgwal -- 2015 -- 7252.jpg|Door of the Laboratorium voor Artsenijbereidkunde, an example of Dutch [[Renaissance architecture]], in [[Amsterdam]] (the [[Netherlands]])\n\nFile:Porte d'entr\u00e9e du palais de Justice de Bruxelles (HDR) - 2043-0077-0.jpg|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] door of the main entrance of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]] ([[Brussels]], Belgium)\n\nFile:Brooklyn Museum 1994.92 Door with Lock (2).jpg|Door with lock, late 19th or early 20th century, wood with iron, from [[Burkina Faso]], in the [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n\nBronze door, Basilica di San Giovanni, 2013.jpg|[[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] bronze doors of the [[Curia Julia]], now in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (Rome)\n\nFile:Door in Morocco, 2010.jpg|An Islamic door decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], in [[Morocco]]\n\nPorte et marquise CCI Nancy.jpg|[[Art Nouveau]] metal and glass door in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (France), with a big transparent [[awning]] above it\n\nSimple door inside the BCR Headquarters Building, in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|Neoclassical door in the BCR Headquarters Building from [[Bucharest]] (Romania)\n\nFile:Tenghua Jiuguan 21 2015-04.JPG|Traditional folding doors in [[The Old Museum of Wisteria]] ([[Changzhou]], China)\n</gallery>\n\n== Different types of door mechanism ==\n[[File:Types of doors.png|thumb|The main types of door mechanisms]]\n\n=== Hinged doors ===\nMost doors are [[hinge]]d along one side to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of rotation is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged [[garage door]]s, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.\n\nDoors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.\n\nA '''swing door''' has special single-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards, and is usually sprung to keep it closed.\n\n'''French doors''' are derived from an original French design called the casement door. It is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.\n\nA '''Mead door''', developed by S Mead of Leicester, swings both ways. It is susceptible to forced entry due to its design.\n\nA '''Dutch door''' or stable door consists of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has a lip on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.\n\nA '''garden door''' resembles a French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an [[espagnolette]] bolt.\n\n=== Sliding doors ===\nIt is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks, often for space or aesthetic considerations.\n\nA '''bypass door''' is a door unit that has two or more sections. The doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access one side of the closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.\n\nDoors which slide inside a wall cavity are called '''[[pocket door]]s'''. This type of door is used in tight spaces where privacy is also required. The door slab is mounted to roller and a track at the top of the door and slides inside a wall. \n\nSliding glass doors are common in many houses, particularly as an entrance to the backyard. Such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures, although they are not counted as fire exit doors. The door that moves is called the \"active leaf\", while the door that remains fixed is called the \"inactive leaf\".\n\n=== Rotating doors ===\nA '''[[revolving door]]''' has several wings or leaves, generally four, radiating from a central shaft, forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis. A revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding, and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out.\n\nA '''pivot door''', instead of hinges, is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge, so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.\n\n=== High-speed door ===\nA '''[[high-speed door]]''' is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4&nbsp;m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded. \n\nHigh-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200,000 a year. They need to be built with heavy-duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the [[Green energy|Green]] and [[Energy saving]] requirements.\n\nIn North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508&nbsp;mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.\n\n=== Automatic ===\n\n'''[[Automatic door|Automatically opening doors]]''' are powered open and closed either by electricity, spring, or both. There are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated:\n\n# A [[sensor]] detects traffic is approaching. Sensors for automatic doors are generally:\n#* A [[pressure sensor]] \u2013 e.g., a floor mat which reacts to the pressure of someone standing on it.\n#* An [[infrared]] [[curtain]] or beam which shines invisible light onto sensors; if someone or something blocks the beam the door is triggered open.\n#* A [[motion sensor]] which uses low-power microwave [[radar]] for the same effect.\n#* A remote sensor (e.g. based on infrared or radio waves) can be triggered by a portable [[remote control]], or is installed inside a vehicle. These are popular for garage doors.\n# A [[switch]] is operated manually, perhaps after security checks. This can be a push button switch or a swipe card.\n# The act of pushing or pulling the door triggers the open and close cycle. These are also known as power-assisted doors.\n\nIn addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure.\n\n=== Others ===\n[[Image:Puertas seccionales.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Sectional doors for industry.]]\n[[File:Torggler evolutiondoor.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|''Evolution Door'', 2013]]\n'''Up-and-over''' or '''overhead''' doors are often used in garages. Instead of hinges it has a mechanism, often [[counterbalance]]d or [[torsion spring|sprung]], that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening. A [[roller shutter]] or '''sectional overhead door''' is one variant of this type.\n\nA '''[[tambour door]]''' or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and \"rolls\" up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets.\n\n'''Inward opening doors''' are doors that can only be opened (or forced open) from outside a building. Such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked. As such doors can only be forced open from the outside, building occupants would be prevented from escaping. In commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency (which is often a regulatory requirement). This is known as a 'breakaway' feature. Pushing the door outward at its closed position, through a switch mechanism, disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward. Upon returning the door to the closed position, power is restored.\n\n'''Rebated doors''', a term chiefly used in Britain, are double doors having a lip or overlap (i.e. a [[Rabbet]]) on the vertical edge(s) where they meet. Fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile, in accordance with the American [[Fire door]].\n\n'''Evolution Door''' is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door. The system is an invention of the Austrian artist Klemens Torggler. It is a further development of the '''{{ill|Drehplattent\u00fcr|de|Drehplattent\u00fcr|vertical-align=sup}}''' that normally consists of two rotatable, connected panels which move to each other when opening.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|title=Kinematics with MicroStation Ch01C-I Grueblers Criteria for 3D 5 Bar|date=20 February 2014|work=YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409090618/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lui6cdRnCw|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Miersch, 17 rue Nicolas Welter-001.jpg|thumb|250px|Transparent awning in [[Luxembourg]]]]\nArchitectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for [[convenience]], [[privacy]], [[safety]], and [[security]] reasons. Doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior, for reasons of [[climate]] control and safety.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nDoors also are applied in more specialized cases:\n* A '''[[blast door|Blast-proof door]]''' is constructed to allow access to a structure as well as to provide protection from the force of explosions.\n* A '''garden door''' is any door that opens to a backyard or [[garden]]. This term is often used specifically for French windows, double French doors (with lites instead of panels), in place of a [[sliding glass door]]. The term also may refer to what is known as ''patio doors''.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n* A jib door is a concealed door, whose surface reflects the moldings and finishes of the wall. These were used in historic English houses, mainly as servants' doors.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n* A '''[[pet door]]''' (also known as a [[cat flap]] or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a [[rubber]] flap, or it may be an actual door hinged on the top that the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only allowing pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.\n* A '''[[trapdoor]]''' is a door that is oriented horizontally in a [[ceiling]] or [[floor]], often accessed via a [[ladder]].\n* A '''water door''' or '''water entrance''', such as those used in [[Venice, Italy]], is a door leading from a building built on the water, such as a canal, to the water itself where, for example, one may enter or exit a private boat or [[water taxi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|website=See Venice, Italy|title=Doors in Venice: among water, art and architecture|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074300/http://www.seevenice.it/en/doors-in-venice-among-water-art-and-architecture/|archivedate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>Water doors make frequent appearances in [[Donna Leon]]'s books, and in some are important plot devices, as in [[Donna Leon#Commissario Guido Brunetti novels|''Acqua Alta'' aka ''Death in High Water'' (1996) and ''Beastly Things'' (2012)]].</ref>\n\n== Construction and components ==\n\n[[File:Door-glossary.png|thumb|Parts of a panel or glazed door]]\n[[File:Door-midrail-detail.png|thumb|Joint between midrail, lockrail and a gunstock stile]]\n[[File:Frame-filled-door.gif|thumb|A frame and filled door]]\n[[File:hollow door.jpg|thumb|A hollow door with one face removed]]\n\n=== Panel doors ===\nPanel doors, also called stile and rail doors, are built with [[frame and panel]] construction. EN 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in European Member States. The main parts are listed below:\n* [[Stile]]s \u2013 Vertical boards that run the full height of a door and compose its right and left edges. The hinges are mounted to the fixed side (known as the \"hanging stile\"), and the handle, lock, bolt or latch are mounted on the swinging side (known as the \"latch stile\").\n* [[Frame and panel|Rails]] \u2013 Horizontal boards at the top, bottom, and optionally in the middle of a door that join the two stiles and split the door into two or more rows of panels. The \"top rail\" and \"bottom rail\" are named for their positions. The bottom rail is also known as \"kick rail\". A middle rail at the height of the bolt is known as the \"lock rail\", other middle rails are commonly known as \"cross rails\".\n* [[Mullion]]s \u2013 Smaller optional vertical boards that run between two rails, and split the door into two or more columns of panels, the term is used sometimes for verticals in doors, but more often (UK and Australia) it refers to verticals in windows.\n* Muntin \u2013 Optional vertical members that divide the door into smaller panels.\n* Panels \u2013 Large, wider boards used to fill the space between the stiles, rails, and mullions. The panels typically fit into grooves in the other pieces, and help to keep the door rigid. Panels may be flat, or in raised panel designs. Can be glued in or stay as a floating panel.\n* Light  \u2013 a piece of glass used in place of a panel, essentially giving the door a window.\n\n=== Board batten doors ===\nAlso known as ledges and braced,\nBoard and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats:\n* Planks \u2013  Boards wider than 9\" that extend the full height of the door, and are placed side by side filling the door's width.\n* Ledges and braces \u2013 Ledges extend horizontally across the door which the boards are affixed to. The ledges hold the planks together. When diagonally they are called braces which prevent the door from skewing. On some doors, especially antique ones, the ledges are replaced with iron bars that are often built into the hinges as extensions of the door-side plates.\n\n=== Ledged and braced doors ===\nAs board and Batten doors\n\n=== Impact-resistant doors ===\nImpact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping, scratching and denting. The formed edges are often made of an engineered material. Impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals, schools, hotels and coastal areas.\n\n=== Frame and filled doors ===\nThis type consists of a solid timber frame, filled on one face, face with Tongue and Grooved boards. Quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face.\n\n=== Flush doors ===\nMany modern doors, including most interior doors, are flush doors:\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* Core material: Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce drumminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core flush doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board and batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are then covered with [[wood veneer]], thin [[plywood]], [[sheet metal]], [[fiberglass]], or [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]]. The wooden materials are usually layered with the grain alternating direction between layers to prevent warping. Fiberglass and metal-faced doors are sometimes given a layer of cellulose so that they may be stained to look like wood.\n\n=== Moulded doors ===\n* [[Stile]]s and [[Frame and panel|rails]] \u2013 As above, but usually smaller. They form the outside edges of the door.\n* '''Core material''': Material within the door used simply to fill space, provide rigidity and reduce druminess.\n** Hollow-core \u2013 Often consists of a [[square lattice|lattice]] or [[hexagonal lattice|honeycomb]] made of [[corrugated cardboard]], extruded polystyrene foam, or thin wooden slats. Can also be built with staggered wooden blocks. Hollow-core molded doors are commonly used as interior doors.\n*** Lock block \u2013 A solid block of wood mounted within a hollow-core flush door near the bolt to provide a solid and stable location for mounting the door's hardware.\n** Stave-core \u2013 Consists of wooden slats stacked upon one another in a manner similar to a board & batten door (though the slats are usually thinner) or the wooden-block hollow-core (except that the space is entirely filled).\n** Solid-core \u2013 Can consist of low-density [[particle board]] or [[foam]] used to completely fill the space within the door. Solid-core flush doors (especially foam-core ones) are commonly used as exterior doors because they provide more [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and strength.\n* Skin \u2013 The front and back faces of the door are covered with HDF / [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] skins.\n\n=== Swing direction ===\n'''Door swings'''\n[[File:Art Nouveau entrance in Pia\u021ba Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu (Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu Square), from Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Nouveau]] door in [[Bucharest]] (Romania), with a [[Mascaron (architecture)|mascaron]] above it]]\nFor most of the world {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, door swings, or handing, are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door (i.e., standing on the side requiring a key to open, going from outside to inside, or from public to private).\n\nIt is especially important to get the hand and swing correct on exterior doors, as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry, and to properly drain.  In some custom [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] (or with some master carpenters), the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge (the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing) so that the door fits tight without binding.  Specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind, not close properly or leak (for exterior doors). Fixing this specification error will be expensive or time consuming. In North America, many doors now come with factory-installed hinges, pre-hung on the jamb and sills.\n\nWhile facing the door from the outside or less secure side, if the hinge is on the right side of the door, the door is \"right handed\"; or if the hinge is on the left, it is \"left handed\". If the door swings toward you, it is \"reverse swing\"; or if the door swings away from you, it is \"Normal swing\".\n\nIn other words,\n*In the United States:\n** '''Left hand hinge (LHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side, or on the public side of the door), the hinges are on the left and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Right hand hinge (RHH):''' Standing outside (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right and the door opens in (away from you).\n** '''Left hand reverse (LHR):''' Standing outside the house (or on the less secure side), the hinges are on the left, knob on right, on opening the door it swings towards you (i.e. the door swings open towards the outside, or \"outswing\")\n** '''Right hand reverse (RHR):''' Standing outside the house (i.e. on the less secure side), the hinges are on the right, knob on left, opening the door by pulling the door towards you (i.e. open swings to the outside, or \"outswing\")\n\n*In Europe:\nOne of the oldest [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] standard applies: DIN 107 \"Building construction; identification of right and left side\" (first 1922-05, current 1974-04) defines that '''doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen'''. If the hinges are on the left, it is a DIN Left door (DIN links, DIN gauche), if the hinges are on the right, it is a DIN Right door (DIN rechts, DIN droite). The DIN Right and DIN Left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as [[mortise lock]]s (referenced in DIN 107). The European Standard DIN EN 12519 \"Windows and pedestrian doors. Terminology\" includes these definitions of orientation.\n\n*In Australia:\nThe \"refrigerator rule\" applies, and a refrigerator door is not opened from the inside. If the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand (or right hung) door. (Australian Standards for Installation of Timber Doorsets, AS 1909\u20131984 pg 6.)\n\nIn public buildings, exterior doors should open to the outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction. If the door opens inward and there is a fire, there can be a crush of people who run for the door and they will not be able to open it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|title=Why do the entry doors to most homes open inward, while in most public buildings, the entry doors open outward?|date=2001-03-02|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920044229/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/remodeling/question584.htm|archivedate=2017-09-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Types ===\nNew exterior doors are largely defined by the type of materials they are made from: [[wood]], [[steel]], [[fiberglass]], [[UPVC]]/vinyl, [[aluminum]], composite, [[Glass|glass (patio doors)]]...\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align =\n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 =Strasbourg 1 rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Castelnau (2).jpg \n| width1 = 140\n| height1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = Wooden door of a building from [[Strasbourg]] (France), decorated with [[pediment]]s on it\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Pierre Rousseau - Double-Leaf Doors - 1942.2.12.a - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif\n| width2 =\n| height2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] double-leaf doors by [[Pierre Rousseau]], 1790s\n}}\n[[File:Glass and metal door on Calea Victoriei (Victory's Avenue) in Bucharest (Romania).jpg|200px|right|thumb|Glass and metal door, decoarted with Neoclassical ornaments, in [[Bucharest]] (Romania)]]\n'''Wooden doors''' \u2013 including solid wood doors \u2013 are a top choice for many homeowners, largely because of the aesthetic qualities of wood. Many wood doors are custom-made, but they have several downsides: their price, their maintenance requirements (regular painting and staining) and their limited insulating value<ref>Exterior Doors; Energy.gov; {{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304181502/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors |archivedate=2015-03-04 }}</ref> (R-5 to R-6, not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors). Wood doors often have an overhang requirement to maintain a warranty. An overhang is a roof, porch area or awning that helps to protect the door and its finish from [[Ultraviolet|UV]] rays.\n\n'''Steel doors''' are another major type of residential front doors; most of them come with a [[polyurethane]] or other type of [[foam]] insulation core \u2013 a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency. Steel doors mostly in default comes along with frame and lock system, which is a high cost efficiency factor compared to ''Wooden doors''\n\nMost modern exterior walls are designed to provide [[thermal insulation]] and [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], which can be indicated by the [[Energy Star]] label or the [[Passive House]] standards. Premium '''composite''' (including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam), '''fiberglass''' and '''vinyl doors''' benefit from the materials they are made from, from a thermal perspective.\n\n=== Insulation and weatherstrips ===\n{{Context|section|date=November 2015}}\nBut there are very few door models with an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] close to 10 (which is far less than the R-40 walls or the R-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings \u2013 [[Passive Solar]] and [[Zero-energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]). Typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency.\n\nMany doors may have good R-values at their center, but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor [[weatherstripping]] and the way the door is manufactured.\n\nDoor weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe standard door sizes in the US run along 2\" increments. Customary sizes have a height of 78\" (1981&nbsp;mm) or 80\" (2032&nbsp;mm) and a width of 18\" (472&nbsp;mm), 24\" (610&nbsp;mm), 26\" (660&nbsp;mm), 28\" (711&nbsp;mm), 30\" (762&nbsp;mm) or 36\" (914&nbsp;mm).<ref>options at homedepot.com</ref> Most residential passage (room to room) doors are 30\" x 80\" (762&nbsp;mm x 2032&nbsp;mm).\n\nA standard US residential (exterior) door size is 36\" x 80\" (91 x 203&nbsp;cm). Interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0\" (91&nbsp;cm). Residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8\" high, as are many small stores, offices, and other light commercial buildings. Larger commercial, public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height. Older buildings often have smaller doors.\n\nThickness:  Most pre-fabricated doors are 1 3/8\" thick (for interior doors) or 1 3/4\" (exterior).\n\n'''Closets:''' small spaces such as closets, dressing rooms, half-baths, storage rooms, cellars, etc. often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design.\n\n'''Garages:'''  Garage doors are generally 7'-0\" or 8'-0\" wide for a single-car opening.  Two car garage doors (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0\".  Because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing.  There are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes. circa 1950's\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe standard DIN doors are defined in DIN 18101 (published 1955-07, 1985-01, 2014-08). The door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels (DIN 68706-1). The DIN commission was also responsible for the harmonized European standard DIN EN 14351-1 for exterior doors and DIN EN 14351-2 for interior doors (published 2006-07, 2010-08), which defines the requirements for the [[CE marking]] giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix.\n\nThe DIN 18101 standard has a normative size (Nennma\u00df) slightly larger than the panel size (T\u00fcrblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985&nbsp;mm (normativ height 2010&nbsp;mm) at panel widths of 610&nbsp;mm, 735&nbsp;mm, 860&nbsp;mm, 985&nbsp;mm, 1110&nbsp;mm, plus a larger door panel size of 1110&nbsp;mm x 2110&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|title=T\u00fcrblattgr\u00f6\u00dfen nach DIN 18101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219203924/http://www.baunetzwissen.de/standardartikel/Fenster-und-Tueren_Tuerblattgroessen-nach-DIN-18101_155263.html|archivedate=2015-02-19}}</ref> The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125&nbsp;mm increments where the height and width are independent.

When a door has more than one movable section, one of the sections may be called a ''leaf''. See [[door furniture]] for a discussion of attachments to doors such as [[door handle]]s, [[doorknob]]s, and [[door knocker]]s.\n* [[Lintel]] \u2013 A horizontal beam above a door that supports the wall above it. (Also known as a ''header'')\n* [[Jamb]]s or legs \u2013 The vertical posts that form the sides of a door frame, where the hinges are mounted, and with which the bolt interacts.\n* Sill (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal [[sill plate]] below the door that supports the door frame. Similar to a [[Window Sill]] but for a door\n* [[Threshold (door)|Threshold]] (for exterior doors) \u2013 A horizontal plate below the door that bridges the crack between the interior floor and the sill.\n* [[Doorstop]] \u2013 a thin slat built inside the frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed, an act which might break the hinges.\n* [[Architrave]] \u2013 The decorative [[molding (decorative)|molding]] that outlines a door frame. (called an [[Archivolt]] if the door is arched). Called ''door casing'' or ''brickmold'' in North America.\n\n=== Related hardware ===\n{{Main|Door furniture}}\n[[File:Door lock.jpg|thumb|Front door of a house with typical [[door furniture]]: a [[letter box]], [[door knocker]], a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] and two [[Lock (security device)|locks]]]]\n[[File:Paris Rue de Douai5134.JPG|thumb|A door knocker with [[putti]]s holding a [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]], in Paris]]\n\nDoor furniture or hardware refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance. This includes items such as hinges, handles, door stops, etc.\n\n== Related accidents ==\n'''Door safety''' relates to prevention of door-related [[accident]]s.  Such accidents take place in various forms, and in a number of locations; ranging from car doors to garage doors. Accidents vary in severity and frequency. According to the [[National Safety Council]] in the [[United States]], 300,000 injuries are caused by doors every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|title=Protecting Children\u2019s Fingers from Door Injuries|work=The Redwoods Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324033919/http://www.redwoodsgroup.com/JCCs/documents/J_RMA_ProtectingChildrensFingers_12.10.05.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects, such as walls, to serious cases resulting in human injury, particularly to fingers, hands, and feet. A closing door can exert up to 40 [[ton]]s per square inch of [[pressure]] between the [[hinge]]s. Because of the number of accidents taking place, there has been a surge in the number of [[lawsuit]]s.  Thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected.\n\nAccording to the US [[General Services Administration]], discussing child care centres:\n{{quote|...It is essential that children's fingers be protected from being crushed or otherwise injured in the hinge space of a swinging door or gate. There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring that this type of injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety...<ref>USA General Services Administration Child Care Center Design Guide, June 1998</ref>}}\n\n=== Outward and inward opening ===\nWhenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person.  In many cases this can be avoided by [[architectural design]] which favors doors which open inwards into rooms (from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor, the door opens outwards).  In cases where this is infeasible, it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing [[vision panel]]s in the door.<ref>Home Safety Guidelines for Architects & Builders, NBS GCR 78-156, BOSTI, December 1978</ref>\n\nHowever, inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside the building may press against the doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. Related accidents include:\n* [[Grue Church fire]] - Grue, Norway in 1822\n* [[Victoria Hall Disaster]] - Sunderland, UK in 1883\n* [[Glen Cinema disaster]] - Paisley, UK in 1929\n* [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] - Boston, USA in 1942\n\nToday, the exterior doors of most large (especially public) buildings open outward, while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms, offices, suites, etc. open inward, as do many exterior doors of houses, particularly in North America.\n\n=== Doorstops ===\n\n[[Doorstop]]s are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall).  Without the door stop damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb the force of a moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion.\n\n=== Door guards ===\n\nThe purpose of door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger trapping devices, or finger guards) is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.\n\nThere are various levels of door protection. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.\nWhich level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a [[risk assessment]] of the door.\n\nThere is also handle-side door protection, which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame, which can cause injury to fingers/hands.\n\n=== Safety doors ===\n\nA safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards.  Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place.  This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular (\"bull-nose\" shaped) extension to the door, which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes.  This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges \u2013 either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a [[doorstop]]).\n\n=== Glass doors ===\n\n[[Arcadia door|Glass doors]] pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from glass doors, [[sticker]]s or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated, tempered or toughened glass.\n\n=== Fire ===\n{{Main|Fire door}}\n\nSpecial purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire, particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke.  In cases where they are improperly installed, employed, or tampered with, the risk of fire can be increased. [[Door closer]]s are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed.\n\nAn additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to [[emergency service]]s personnel in order to fight the fire, rescue occupants, etc. [[Door breaching]] techniques may be required in these situations to gain access.\n\n[[Panic bar]]s are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency.\n\n=== Vehicle doors ===\n{{Main|Vehicle door}}\nThere may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors, due to the proximity in which the occupant sits. In some car accidents, injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occur.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nBicyclists cycling on public roads fear [[dooring]]: collision with an abruptly opened vehicle door. Because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road they are particularly vulnerable.\n\n=== Aircraft doors ===\n\nDoors which lead from interior, pressurized, sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure \u2013 most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.\n\nA number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight, often accidentally:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972)\n* [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974)\n* [[United Airlines Flight 811]] (1989)\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Hinge bender]], a tool for adjusting door hinges\n* [[Biometrics]]\n* [[Closed-circuit television]]\n* [[Coal hole]]\n* [[Door security]]\n* [[Double margin doors]]\n* [[Electronic lock]]\n* [[Identity document]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Janus]], Roman god of doors\n* [[Keycard]]s\n* [[Locksmithing]]\n* [[Lock picking]]\n* [[Logical security]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{EB1911 |last=Spiers |first=Richard Phen\u00e9 |wstitle=Door |volume=8 |pages=419\u2013420}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Doors}}\n{{Room}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Doors| ]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: time consuming \u2192 time-consuming, 1425-1452 \u2192 1425\u20131452 (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door"}

Frankland said that \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state.

Gray shot at the van as it passed the house, which was by then ablaze. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nGray started shooting indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals who had seen the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy several times in the back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned towards three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy.

Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former [[Green Island, New Zealand|Green Island]] mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called [[1-1-1]] (the [[emergency telephone number]]).

Guthrie enlisted the help of Constable Russell Anderson, who had arrived a short time earlier with the fire service. He armed Anderson with a rifle belonging to a resident. With darkness approaching, the pair moved through the township to Gray's house, where Guthrie deployed the constable to cover the front while he moved to cover the more dangerous rear of the house. Detective Paul Alan Knox and two constables arrived, starting the first step of the \"cordon, contain, appeal\" standard police strategy for armed offenders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/service/aos|title=Armed Offenders Squads|publisher=New Zealand Police|accessdate=18 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017040949/http://www.police.govt.nz/service/aos|archivedate=17 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGuthrie observed Gray and relayed his movements inside the house to the police communications centre. After some time he lost sight of the gunman, and advised the detective to warn everyone to be alert. Anderson spotted Gray coming out the front of his property and issued a challenge, at which the gunman retreated quickly, passing through the rear of his property. Taking cover in the sand dunes of a neighbouring [[Bach (New Zealand)|crib]], Guthrie encountered Gray coming out of the darkness. Yelling at the gunman to surrender, he fired a warning shot. Gray shouted, \"Don't shoot!\", leading Guthrie to believe he was surrendering. However, Gray suddenly fired several times, one shot striking Guthrie in the head, killing him instantly.<ref name=LondonGazette/>\n\nMinutes later the Dunedin branch of the AOS began to arrive and sealed off the township with a roadblock about 250 metres along the only road out of Aramoana, securing it with an [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured car]].<ref name=\"ODT_Hours_of_Terror_End\"/> AOS units from [[Christchurch]], [[Timaru]], and [[Invercargill]] were called in for support.

The Iroquois crew flew for over eight hours in support of the operation during the day, including positioning police snipers in the surrounding hills. After the initial reconnaissance flight, the ATS moved out as two squads and met up with the Timaru AOS, who were holding positions.

He first shot Vanessa Percy several times in the back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned towards three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived.<ref>{{cite news|title='Don't shoot me' wounded four-year-olds plea|date=16 November 1990|newspaper=Otago Daily Times|page=2}}</ref> Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former [[Green Island, New Zealand|Green Island]] mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called [[1-1-1]] (the [[emergency telephone number]]). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the [[George Medal]] for bravery.<ref name=LondonGazette>{{London Gazette|issue=52837 |supp=y|pages=2783\u20132784|date=17 February 1992}}</ref> Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.\n\n===First responders===\nThe first armed police officer to arrive was Sergeant [[Stewart Guthrie]], officer in charge of [[Port Chalmers]] police station and an NCO in the [[Armed Offenders Squad]] (AOS).<ref name=Forbes1997p203>{{harv|Forbes|1997|p=203}}</ref> He came armed with a [[Smith & Wesson Model 10]] police revolver (in 1990 front-line Police did not routinely carry firearms). Guthrie enlisted the help of Constable Russell Anderson, who had arrived a short time earlier with the fire service. He armed Anderson with a rifle belonging to a resident. With darkness approaching, the pair moved through the township to Gray's house, where Guthrie deployed the constable to cover the front while he moved to cover the more dangerous rear of the house. Detective Paul Alan Knox and two constables arrived, starting the first step of the \"cordon, contain, appeal\" standard police strategy for armed offenders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/service/aos|title=Armed Offenders Squads|publisher=New Zealand Police|accessdate=18 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017040949/http://www.police.govt.nz/service/aos|archivedate=17 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGuthrie observed Gray and relayed his movements inside the house to the police communications centre. After some time he lost sight of the gunman, and advised the detective to warn everyone to be alert. Anderson spotted Gray coming out the front of his property and issued a challenge, at which the gunman retreated quickly, passing through the rear of his property. Taking cover in the sand dunes of a neighbouring [[Bach (New Zealand)|crib]], Guthrie encountered Gray coming out of the darkness. Yelling at the gunman to surrender, he fired a warning shot. Gray shouted, \"Don't shoot!\", leading Guthrie to believe he was surrendering. However, Gray suddenly fired several times, one shot striking Guthrie in the head, killing him instantly.<ref name=LondonGazette/>\n\nMinutes later the Dunedin branch of the AOS began to arrive and sealed off the township with a roadblock about 250 metres along the only road out of Aramoana, securing it with an [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured car]].<ref name=\"ODT_Hours_of_Terror_End\"/> AOS units from [[Christchurch]], [[Timaru]], and [[Invercargill]] were called in for support.

A bus took the ATS to Port Chalmers, which was choked with vehicles, where residents from Aramoana briefed the group about the township and Gray. ATS members took a reconnaissance flight over the township in an [[RNZAF]] [[UH-1H]] Iroquois helicopter. The helicopter initially flew high as it had no armour from small arms fire; Gray had shot at a private news helicopter earlier that morning.<ref>{{harv|Forbes|1997|pp=201\u201302}}</ref>\n\nThe crew of the Air Force Iroquois then carried out low, slow passes over areas of bush where Gray was believed to be hiding, carrying armed police and dropping tear gas grenades as it did so, in an attempt to 'flush him out'. The Iroquois crew flew for over eight hours in support of the operation during the day, including positioning police snipers in the surrounding hills. After the initial reconnaissance flight, the ATS moved out as two squads and met up with the Timaru AOS, who were holding positions. The group received fire orders: \"if he has a firearm, he is to be shot\".<ref name=Forbes1997p203/> Meanwhile, Gray had entered a [[bach (New Zealand)|crib]], eaten a small meal and gone to sleep.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Manhunt and shootout===\nSome Christchurch members of the ATS moved into Aramoana at about 6:00&nbsp;a.m. on 14 November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/tvnz-wins-high-court-appeal-over-aramoana-story-4486488/video |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028124224/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/tvnz-wins-high-court-appeal-over-aramoana-story-4486488/video |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> The ATS went first to Gray's house, passing bodies on the street.

The crib had large hedges on both sides, and a [[asbestos cement|fibrolite]] shed at the rear. The group spotted Gray briefly at a window, and a battle ensued. Police put a stun grenade through a window, but it bounced off a mattress that Gray had placed as a barricade and landed back near police. Police fired [[Riot control agent|teargas]] into the crib.

The factory was located in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], and was called the [[Dodge Main|Dodge Main factory]] from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928.\n\nDodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of [[truck]]s and [[Full-size car|full-sized]] passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made compact cars (such as the 1963\u201376 [[Dodge Dart|Dart]]) and midsize cars (such as the \"B-Body\" [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] and [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] from 1966\u201378).\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]] of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K [[automobile platform|platform]] and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the [[Dodge Caravan]].\n\nThe Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its short-lived merger with [[Daimler AG|Daimler-Benz AG]] from 1998 to 2007,<ref>{{cite web |title=Company History - \"World Corp.\" vision: the merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler (1995 - 2007) |url=https://www.daimler.com/company/tradition/company-history/1995-2007.html |publisher=Daimler |date=2019 |quote=On 7 May 1998, Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft in Germany and Chrysler Corporation in the United States of America signed a merger contract. |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> its subsequent sale to [[Cerberus Capital Management]], its 2009 [[Effects of the 2008\u20132010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|bailout by the United States government]], and its subsequent [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and acquisition by [[Fiat]].\n\nIn 2011, Dodge and its model sub-brands, [[Ram Trucks|Dodge Ram]], and [[Dodge Viper]] were separated. Dodge said that the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] would be an [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] product and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] will be a standalone marque.

Henry Ford selected the Dodge brothers to supply a wide range of components for his original [[Ford Model A (1903\u201304)|Model A (1903\u201304)]] that included the complete chassis; thus Ford needed to add only the body and wheels to finish the cars.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeLorenzo |first=Matt |title=Dodge 100 Years |date=2014 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9781627880848 |pages=8\u20139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zm91AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Henry offered the Dodge brothers a 10% share in his new company in return for $10,000 worth of goods.\n\nThe first machine shop where the brothers worked as parts suppliers for Olds and Ford was located at the Boydell Building on Beaubien Street at Lafayette.

During this time, the Model 30 was evolved to become the new Series 116 (though it retained the same basic construction and engineering features). However, as the 1920s progressed, Dodge gradually lost its ranking as the third best-selling automobile manufacturer, slipping down to seventh in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, Dodge Brothers expanded the truck line and became a leading builder of light trucks. After greatly expanding production capacity, in 1921 Haynes signed a contract whereby Dodge's vast dealer network would exclusively market trucks with bodies built by Graham Brothers of Evansville, Indiana. This Graham truck line from then on used only Dodge-built chassis, from 1-ton to 3-ton capacity, and Dodge kept making light-duty trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\">{{cite web|url= https://forums.aaca.org/topic/210257-my-1934-dodge-4x4-15-ton/ |title=my 1934 Dodge 4x4 1.5 ton - Dodge Trucks |work=Antique Automobile Club of America - Discussion Forums |date=June 5, 2019 |accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStagnation in development was becoming apparent, however, and the public responded by dropping Dodge Brothers to fifth place in the industry by 1925. That year, the Dodge Brothers company was sold by the widows to the well-known investment group [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] for no less than US$146&nbsp;million (at the time, the largest cash transaction in history).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://usjunkyardsnearme.com/car-resources/dodge-history/ |title=Dodge History |publisher=usjunkyardsnearme.com |accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDillon, Read & Co. offered non-voting stock on the market in the new Dodge Brothers firm, and along with the sale of bonds was able to raise $160&nbsp;million, reaping a $14&nbsp;million (net) profit. All voting stock was retained by Dillon, Read. Frederick Haynes remained as company head until E.G. Wilmer was named board chairman in November, 1926. Wilmer was a banker with no auto experience and Haynes remained as president. Changes to the car, save for superficial things like [[trim level]]s and colors, remained minimal until 1927, when the new Senior six-cylinder line was introduced. The former four-cylinder line was kept on, but renamed the [[Dodge Fast Four|Fast Four]] line until it was dropped in favor of two lighter six-cylinder models (the Standard Six and Victory Six) for 1928.\n\nOn October 1, 1925, Dodge Brothers, Inc., acquired a 51% interest in [[Graham Brothers]], Inc., for $13&nbsp;million and the remaining 49% on May 1, 1926. Haynes purchased all of Graham's truck activity, and in 1926, the Graham branch took charge of all of Dodge's truck manufacturing.

Eventually Dodge was sold to the new Chrysler Corporation in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://gearheads.org/the-dodge-motor-company/ |title=The Dodge Motor Company |date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Gear Heads |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> On January 2, 1929, Chrysler announced that the Graham Badge was dropped, and Dodge Brothers were building Chrysler's trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\"/>\n\n===Pre-war years===\n[[File:1933 Dodge advert by Muray.jpg|thumb|Dodge aimed for the luxury market in this advertisement for the 1933 model Eight]]\nTo fit better in the Chrysler Corporation lineup, alongside low-priced [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and medium-priced [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], Dodge's lineup for early 1930 was trimmed down to a core group of two lines and thirteen models (from three lines and nineteen models just over a year previous). Prices started out just above DeSoto but were somewhat less than top-of-the-line [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]], in a small-scale recreation of [[General Motors Companion Make Program|General Motors' \"step-up\" marketing concept]]. (DeSoto and Dodge would swap places in the market for the 1933 model year, Dodge dropping down between Plymouth and DeSoto.) As Plymouth cars were sold at Chrysler dealerships, Dodge branded vehicles were sold as a lower cost alternative to DeSoto.\n\nFor 1930, Dodge took another step up by adding a new eight-cylinder line to replace the existing Senior six-cylinder. This basic format of a dual line with Six and Eight models continued through 1933, and the cars were gradually streamlined and lengthened in step with prevailing trends of the day. The Dodge Eight was replaced by a larger Dodge DeLuxe Six for 1934, which was dropped for 1935. A long-[[wheelbase]] edition of the remaining Six was added for 1936 and would remain a part of the lineup for many years. To enhance production, in 1932 Chrysler built a factory in [[Los Angeles (Maywood) Assembly|Los Angeles, California]] where Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge and Plymouth vehicles were built until the factory closed in 1971.\n[[File:1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck]]\n[[File:Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939.jpg|thumb|Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939]]\n\nThe Dodge line, along with most of the corporation's output, was restyled in the so-called \"Wind Stream\" look for 1935. This was a mild form of [[streamliner|streamlining]], which saw sales jump remarkably over the previous year (even though Dodge as a whole still dropped to fifth place for the year after two years of holding down fourth). Dodge never got the radical [[Airflow Chrysler|Airflow]] styling that was the cause of depressed sales of Chryslers and DeSotos from 1934 to 1937, as a passenger sedan, but it was used on commercial truck for a short time. Dodge (along with the rest of Chrysler) added safety features such as a smooth, flat dashboard with no protruding knobs, curved in door handles, and padded front-seat backs for the benefit of the rear-seat occupants.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1940_Dodge/1940_Dodge_Brochure/1940%20Dodge-09-10.html |title=1940 Dodge Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother major restyle arrived for the 25th-anniversary 1939 models, which Dodge dubbed the Luxury Liner series. These were once again completely redesigned, with new bodies for 1940, again in 1941, and a refreshing for 1942. However, just after the 1942 models were introduced, Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] forced the shutdown of Dodge's passenger car [[assembly line]]s in favor of [[Military production during World War II|war production]] in February 1942. 1941 saw the introduction of Fluid Drive for Dodge cars, which eliminated stalling or bucking if the clutch were released too quickly. This feature put a fluid coupling in between the engine and the clutch, although the driver still had to shift gears manually.\n\n===World War II===\nChrysler was prolific in its production of [[Materiel|war materiel]], especially from 1942 to 1945.

The \"[[supply and demand|seller's market]]\" of the early [[postwar]] years, brought on by the lack of any new cars throughout the war, meant that every automaker found it easy to sell vehicles regardless of any drawbacks they might have. Like almost every other automaker, Dodge sold lightly [[facelift (product)|facelifted]] revisions of its 1942 design through the 1948 season. As before, these were a single series of six-cylinder models with two trim levels (basic Deluxe or plusher Custom). From 1949 until 1954, Fluid Drive could be combined with \"Gyro-Matic,\" a semi-automatic transmission which reduced (but did not eliminate) the need to shift gears.\n\nStyling was not initially Dodge's strong point during this period, though that began to change by 1953 under the direction of corporate design chief [[Virgil Exner]]. However the deluxe Coronet series, introduced for 1949, offered extra luxury as the top of the line. The Coronet Diplomat, Dodge's first pillarless hardtop coupe, was new for 1950, at least one year before Ford, Plymouth, and other popular car makes offered it. At the same time, Dodge also introduced its first V8 engine \u2013 the Red Ram Hemi, a smaller version of the original design of the famed [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Chrysler Hemi]]. The new 1953 bodies were smaller and based on the Plymouth. For 1954, sales dropped, the stubby styling not going over well with the public. 1954 also saw the introduction of the fully automatic PowerFlite transmission.\n\nChrysler borrowed $250 million from [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] in 1954 to finance expansion, acquisition, and updating the outdated styling of their car lines that was contributed to Chrysler failing to benefit from the postwar boom as GM and Ford were.<ref>{{cite book|last=Genat |first=Robert |title=Mopar Muscle |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590839 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yARkK-FHHO8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |year=2004 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jefferys |first=Steve |title=Management and Managed: Fifty Years of Crisis at Chrysler |year=1986 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=9780521304412 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1954/03/02/83747978.html?pageNumber=33 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 2, 1954 |title=Chrysler Borrows $250 Million For Growth on Note Due in 2054 |pages=33, 36}}</ref>\n\nExner led creation of the new corporate \"[[Forward Look]]\" styling of 1955, beginning a new era for Dodge. With steadily upgraded styling and ever-stronger engines every year through 1960, Dodge found a ready market for its products as America discovered the joys of freeway travel. This situation improved when Dodge introduced a new line of Dodges called the Dart to do battle against Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth. The result was that Dodge sales in the middle price class collapsed. Special and regional models were sold as well, including the LaFemme (a white and orchid-trimmed hardtop marketed toward women) and the Texan, a gold-accented Dodge sold in the Lone Star State. 1957 saw the introduction of a new automatic transmission, three-speed TorqueFlite. Both PowerFlite and TorqueFlite were controlled by mechanical push-buttons until 1965. 1956 saw the introduction of the 4-door pillarless hardtop (the same year most other makes offered this body style) in all three Dodge series, Custom Royal, Royal, and Coronet. Dodge's pillarless models were all badged \"Lancer.\"\n[[File:Dodge Coronet 1958.jpg|thumb|1958 Dodge Coronet Lancer hardtop coupe]]\n\nDodge entered the compact car field for 1961 with their new [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]], a variation on Plymouth's [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]. Though it was not initially successful, the [[Dodge Dart|Dart]] range that succeeded the Lancer in 1963 would prove to be one of the division's top sellers for many years.\n\nChrysler made an ill-advised move to downsize the Dodge and Plymouth full-size lines for 1962, which resulted in a loss of sales. However, they turned this around in 1965 by turning those former full-sizes into \"new\" mid-size models; Dodge revived the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] nameplate in this way and later added a sporty [[fastback]] version called the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] that became both a sales leader and a winner on the [[NASCAR]] circuit. Not only did this style dominate the racetrack for 4 full years, its aerodynamic improvements forever changed the face of NASCAR racing.\n\nFull-size models evolved gradually during this time. After Dodge dealers complained about not having a true full-size car in the fall of 1961, the Custom 880 was hurried into production. The Custom 880 used the 1962 Chrysler Newport body with the 1961 Dodge front end and interior. The 880 continued into 1965, the year a completely new full-size body was put into production, the [[Dodge Polara|Polara]] entered the medium price class and the [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] was added as the top series. The Polara and Monaco were changed mostly in appearance for the next ten years or so. Unique \"[[fuselage]]\" styling was employed for 1969 through 1973 and then was toned down again for the 1974 to 1977 models.\n[[File:1967 Dodge Coronet.jpg|right|thumb|1967 Dodge Coronet 440 sedan]]\n\nDodge targeted the [[muscle car]] market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Along with the Charger, models like the Coronet R/T and [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]] were popular with buyers seeking performance. The pinnacle of this effort was the introduction of the [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]] sports coupe and convertible (Dodge's entry into the \"pony car\" class ) in 1970, which offered everything from mild economy engines up to the race-ready Hemi V8 in the same package.\n\nIn an effort to reach every segment of the market, Dodge even reached a hand across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to its partner, [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and marketed their subcompact as the [[Dodge Colt|Colt]] to compete with the [[AMC Gremlin]], [[Chevrolet Vega]], and [[Ford Pinto]]. Chrysler would over the years come to rely heavily on their relationship with Mitsubishi. At the same time, Dodge got a version of the Plymouth Duster, marketed as the Dodge [[Dodge Dart#Third generation (1963\u20131966)|Demon]]. It was inexpensive, but with its slant-six engine (or V8), the Demon could not achieve the fuel economy of the four-cylinder Colt. The Demon sold in much fewer numbers than the Duster, so it is considered more collectible today, especially the V8 versions.\n\n=== 1973\u20131980 ===\n[[File:Dodge Charger (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Charger]]\n[[File:1977Diplomat.jpg|right|thumb|1977 [[Dodge Diplomat]] sedan]]\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] caused significant changes at Dodge, as well as Chrysler as a whole. Except for the Colt and Slant Six models of the Dart, Dodge's lineup was quickly seen as extremely inefficient. In fairness, this was true of most American automakers at the time, but Chrysler was also not in the best financial shape to do anything about it. Consequently, while General Motors and Ford were quick to begin downsizing their largest cars, Chrysler (and Dodge) moved more slowly out of necessity.\n\nAt the very least, Chrysler was able to use some of its other resources. Borrowing the recently introduced [[Chrysler Horizon]] from their [[Chrysler Europe|European division]], Dodge was able to get its new [[Dodge Omni|Omni]] subcompact on the market fairly quickly. At the same time, they increased the number of models imported from Japanese partner [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] starting in 1971: first came a smaller Colt (based on Mitsubishi's [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] line), then a revival of the Challenger ([[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda|Dodge Challenger]]) in 1976 as a compact hardtop coupe with nothing more than a four-cylinder under the hood, rather than the booming V8s of yore.\n\nThe 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]]. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} \"LA\" series small block V8 to three versions of {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} big block V8. The standard engine was the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225&nbsp;hp) being available as an option.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.car.info/en-se/dodge/charger/charger-se-1975-16796485|title=Dodge Charger SE 1975|website=car.info|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812.\n\n1976 was the Dart's final year in the North American market. The [[rear-view mirror]] was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake performance requirements, and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart's 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille's parking lamps were cast in [[amber (color)|amber]], whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs. The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite book|last= Statham|first=Steve|title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year= 2000|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz-ItcylfasC&pg=PA124&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=NHlLS8v7GY7qygTWvpH5DQ&client=safari&cd=1#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn= 978-0-7603-0760-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> ''Car & Driver'' magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of {{convert|121.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to be second to the Corvette's {{convert|124.5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette, 1968\u20131982|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year=2000|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrPjl25HbucC&pg=PA105&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=qnlLS96JOJjCM_7j5IQO&client=safari&cd=6#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn=978-0-7603-0418-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref>\n\nDodge's replacement for the Dart was the Aspen, introduced in mid-1975 as a 1976 model. This new design featured lighter weight resulting in slightly improved fuel economy; it also had more interior and trunk room than the Dart. Front suspension was a new design; it featured transverse-mounted torsion bars which not only improved ride, but cornering as well. Its boxy styling gave the impression of a larger car; however sales had to be shared with the virtually identical Plymouth Volare. Both cars were available in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles, and in both base and deluxe trim. Despite its virtues, customers soon found out about the Aspen's rush to market when they saw their cars experience severe body rust within a couple years on the road; engine and drive train problems plagued the Aspen/Volare twins, and although the problems were largely worked out within a few years, the final Aspens were the 1980 models. This car was available with either a 225 cubic-inch Slant Six, or a small block V8 displacing 318 or 360 cubic inches.\n\n[[File:Dodge-Dart-sedan-2.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Dart 4-door sedan]]\n\n1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet, at least so far as the name Coronet went, also its body style choices were relegated to just only two four-door models, the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only was replaced by the [[Dodge Charger]] Sport 2-door model, which, itself, appeared for only one model year. During the next model year (1977), the mid-size Dodge Coronet would be renamed [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], which would be given stacked rectangular headlights and other minor cosmetic changes, that would provide a prompt sales boost. The Coronet and Charger were effectively replaced by the [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] for 1977, which was actually a fancier Aspen.\n\nAlso, during that same model year, the full-size Dodge Monaco would be renamed Dodge Royal Monaco, which would appear for just one model year only and after that, both Dodge and Plymouth (which would include Dodge Royal Monaco's entire Plymouth Gran Fury counterpart line up as well) would discontinue all production of any more full-size models. It lost sales every year, until finally being replaced by the [[Dodge St. Regis|St. Regis]] for 1979 following a one-year absence from the big car market. In a reversal of what happened for 1965, the St. Regis was an upsized Coronet. During the following model year (1978), the mid-size Dodge Monaco (which would include its entire Plymouth Fury counterpart line up as well) would make its final appearance (for all during the remainder of the 1970s).\n\nWhile the Aspen got accolades for styling and handling, build quality was problematic, sullying the car's reputation at the time when sales were desperately needed. It was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent stalling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Aspen also had difficulty in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} This resulted in several recalls.\n\nThe Dodge Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]. It was sold in two forms, the \"XE\" and the \"GT\" and was the last vehicle to use the long running [[Chrysler B platform]]. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded off Charger, and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for [[NASCAR]] that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975\u20131978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow [[opera window]]s, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes and seats; the suspension included Chrysler's standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with [[Lean-burn#Chrysler Electronic Lean-Burn|Lean-Burn]], while two and four-barrel carbureted {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were optional; weight was nearly {{convert|3900|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Omni and Horizon appeared at a critical time for Chrysler, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. In 1978, Chrysler had beaten out Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically-produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Rabbit]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/motoring-memories/motoring-memories-dodge-omniplymouth-horizon-1978-1990/|first=Bill |last=Vance |title=Motoring Memories: Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, 1978-1990 |publisher=autos canada |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}</ref> However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler's financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler's K-cars]], the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler's best selling model line.<ref name=RT82>{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January\u2013February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 93 }}</ref>\n\nEverything came to a head in 1979 when Chrysler's new chairman, [[Lee Iacocca]], requested and received federal loan guarantees from the [[United States Congress]] in an effort to save the company from having to file bankruptcy. With a Federal Loan in hand, Chrysler quickly set to work on new models that would leave the past behind, while reorganizing to pay the government loan which stood at 29%.\n\nThe Dodge Mirada was a [[mid-size]]d, [[rear-wheel drive]] [[coupe]] manufactured and marketed by Dodge for model years 1980 to 1983 sharing the [[Chrysler J platform]] along with its [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variants, the second generation [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged during its 4-year run, with the exception of paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty [[personal luxury car]] with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.\n\n=== 1981\u20131990 ===\n[[File:Dodge Aries sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1981\u201382 Aries Special Edition]]\n\nThe first fruit of Chrysler's crash development program was the \"[[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]]\", the Dodge version of which was the [[Dodge Aries]]. This basic and durable [[front-wheel drive]] platform spawned a whole range of new models at Dodge during the 1980s, including the groundbreaking [[Dodge Caravan]]. [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. [[Henry Ford II]] rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan \u2013 a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons.<ref name=\"allpar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref> Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using the [[Chrysler S platform]], an extended derivative of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The Caravan not only helped save Chrysler as a serious high-volume American automaker, but also spawned an entirely new market segment that supplanted the role of the station wagon: the [[minivan]].\n\nBy 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller [[front-wheel drive]] designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler's then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at [[American Motors]] (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] to build the cars.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\">{{cite journal |url=http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143253/http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |title=Oldest Auto Plant to Make Newest V-6 |first=David C. |last=Smith |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 June 2008 |archivedate=6 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Chrysler's tooling was moved from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> This relationship evolved into Chrysler's purchase of AMC in 1987.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> Following the demise of the [[Dodge St. Regis]] R-body in 1981, the Diplomat remained, becoming the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the [[Dodge Monaco#Fifth generation (1989-92)|Monaco]] debuted as a 1990 model.\n\n[[File:1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe]]\n[[File:1989 Dodge Aries K coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1985\u20131989 Dodge Aries coupe]]\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iaccoca]] held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat's carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models:\n* Dodge Diplomat (5.2&nbsp;L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined\n* Chevrolet Caprice (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined\n* Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined\n\nThe Daytona originally used the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]] in [[normally aspirated]] (93&nbsp;hp) or [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] (142&nbsp;hp) form. The 100 [[horsepower|hp]] 2.5&nbsp;L K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2&nbsp;L Turbo I engine's horsepower was increased to {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}}. The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best#1984|10Best]] list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler [[electronic voice alert]] system through 1987. A performance oriented \"[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]\" version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987. For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a ''Shelby Z'' trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II ({{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \u2013 {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}) intercooled version of the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]], as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with [[Getrag]] gears. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name ''Chrysler GS Turbo II''. A more luxury-oriented ''Pacifica'' trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver's seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times).\n\n[[File:87-91 Dodge Daytona.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1987\u20131991 Dodge Daytona]]\n[[File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg|thumb|left|1987 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z]]\n\nDiplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver's side [[airbag]] as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler's lineup (they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag). Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver.\n\nThe Dodge Dynasty is related to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]; both car lines were built on the [[Chrysler C platform]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]]. It is also similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] and [[Chrysler Imperial]], which were available from 1990 to 1993 on an extended wheelbase platform of the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. The [[Lee Iacocca]]-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]. Dynasty trim levels included base and LE. Additionally, a \"Brougham\" package was offered on 1992\u201393 LE models that added a padded \"landau\" [[vinyl roof]]. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers. This greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car. All models (1988\u20131993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car's speed exceeded 15 miles per hour.\n\nThe 1989\u20131990 Ultradrive equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991\u20131993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the 4 cylinder & 3-speed TorqueFlite transmission. The 1988 3.0&nbsp;L V6 models with TorqueFlight transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. The new 3.3&nbsp;L V6 engine for 1990, with Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. A 2.5-litre [[inline-four engine|inline-4]] Chrysler engine (base model only), a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]], the 6G72 engine, and a [[Chrysler]]-built 3.3&nbsp;L V6 were available, although the 3.3&nbsp;L V6 was not available until 1990. The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0&nbsp;L in 1988. The new electronically controlled four-speed [[automatic transmission]], known as the Ultradrive or A604 ([[List of Chrysler transmissions]]), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. The vast majority of Dynastys sold to private customers had V6 engines; four-cylinder models mostly went to the fleet market.\n\nThrough the late 1980s and 1990s, Dodge's designation as the sporty-car division was backed by a succession of high-performance and/or aggressively styled models including the:\n*[[Dodge Daytona|Daytona]]\n*[[Dodge 600|600]] \n*Performance variants of the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]]\n*[[Dodge Viper|Viper]]\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:1991 Dodge Viper Indianapolis 500 Pace Car.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|The pre-production Dodge Viper (SR I) as the pace car for the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]].]]\n[[File:1990-92 Dodge Monaco.JPG|thumb|1990\u20131992 Dodge Monaco LE]]\n[[File:Spirit RT Front34.jpg|thumb|right|1991 [[Dodge Spirit#R/T|Dodge Spirit R/T]]]]\n[[File:Dodge Intrepid LB 1993-1997 19feb2007.jpg|thumb|Rear view]]\n[[File:1st Dodge Stratus.jpg|thumb|Cab Forward Design on a 1996 [[Dodge Stratus]]]]\n\nThe Omni and the Horizon ended production in 1990, and were replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/[[Plymouth Sundance]], which were both introduced for 1987. Both the Monaco and Premier were discontinued during the 1992 model year. However, its state of the art manufacturing plant and the key executive from American Motors behind the Premier/Monaco design, [[Francois Castaing]], would lead to the successful and highly rated \"[[Cab forward#Automobiles|cab-forward]]\" [[Chrysler LH platform|LH]] [[Dodge Intrepid]], [[Chrysler Concorde]], and [[Eagle Vision]] versions in late 1992 when production resumed at [[Brampton Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Francois J.

The Spirit sold well and had higher consumer acceptance than the [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]] that replaced it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Dodge-branded Mitsubishi vehicles were phased out by 1993 except for the Dodge Stealth running through 1996, though Mitsubishi-made engines and electrical components were still widely used in American domestic Chrysler products.\n\nIn 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as \"The New Dodge\", which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by [[Edward Herrmann]] that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also,he would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade.\n\nLater that year was the introduction of new [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]] sedan, totally different from its boxy [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] predecessor. The Intrepid used what Chrysler called \"[[cab forward]]\" styling, with the wheels pushed out to the corners of the chassis for maximum passenger space. The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch wheels with better tires, and stiffer \"touring\" suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5&nbsp;L SOHC engine rated at (214&nbsp;hp).\n\nIn 1994, the new second generation [[Dodge Ram]] pickup was introduced with bold styling that departed radically from the boxy designs of trucks made by the Big Three for two decades prior. The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the \"Louisville Slugger\" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref> The redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks.\n\nThey followed up on this idea in a smaller scale with the [[Dodge Neon|Neon]] and [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]]. The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the [[Chrysler JA platform]] (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] ([[United States]] only). The Stratus, [[Plymouth Breeze]], and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] were all on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time.\n\nThe car was [[Badge engineering|badged and sold]] as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Mexico]] was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the '''Chrysler Neon'''. At the Neon's release, then president of [[Chrysler Corporation]] [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] said, \"There's an old saying in [[Detroit]]: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.'

The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the [[Dodge Dakota]], both featured a [[body-on-frame]] construction and both were produced at the [[Newark Assembly]] Plant in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], Delaware.

Rationalizing Chrysler's broad lineup was a priority, and Dodge's sister brand Plymouth was withdrawn from the market. With this move, Dodge became DaimlerChrysler's low-price division as well as its performance division.\n\nThe Intrepid, Stratus, and Neon updates of the 1998 to 2000 timeframe were largely complete before Daimler's presence, and Dodge's first experience of any platform sharing with the German side of the company was the 2005 [[Dodge Magnum|Magnum]] [[station wagon]], introduced as a replacement for the Intrepid.

In addition to the 2.4&nbsp;L \"World Engine\" and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0&nbsp;L naturally aspirated \"World Engine\", as well as a 2.0&nbsp;L turbocharged diesel ([[Unit injector|Pumpe-D\u00fcse]]) made by [[Volkswagen]].<ref name=\"2008-2014allpar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/avenger.html |title=2008-2014 Dodge Avenger cars |publisher=AllPar |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> As a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger came to showrooms in February 2007.\n[[File:Dodge Avenger rear 20080517.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]\n\nFurther cost savings were explored in the form of an extensive platform-sharing arrangement with Mitsubishi, which spawned the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]] subcompact as a replacement for the Neon, and the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] sedan. The rear-drive chassis was then used in early 2008 to build a new [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], with styling reminiscent of the original 1970 Challenger. Like its predecessor, the new Challenger coupe was available with a powerful V8 engine (base models featured a V6). In Spring 2007, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] reached an agreement with [[Cerberus Capital Management]] to sell its Chrysler Group subsidiary, of which the Dodge division was a part. Soon after, the housing bubble began to collapse the American market, and on May 1, 2009, Chrysler and GM filed for bankruptcy on the same day.\n\n===Fiat ownership===\nOn June 10, 2009, Italian automaker [[Fiat]] formed a partnership with Chrysler under [[Sergio Marchionne]], with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a \"bridge loan\" or \"bailout\". The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio's plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], in 2014. The combined company will be based in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebhardt |first=Tommaso |last2=Clothier |first2=Mark |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-08/marchionne-says-london-to-have-fiat-chrysler-headquarters.html |title=Marchionne Says London to Have Fiat Chrysler Headquarters |publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Dodge reintroduced a compact car based on an [[Alfa Romeo]] design called the Dart. It was the first new Dodge model produced under FCA.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, FCA announced a major restructuring, in which Dodge would focus solely on performance vehicles and will be positioned between [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] (which is moving downmarket into mainstream vehicles) and a relaunched [[Alfa Romeo]] (making its return to North America after a 20-year absence) in the FCA lineup. This is a set up similar to [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]], which positions [[Peugeot]] as its mainstream brand while [[Citro\u00ebn]] is more performance-based, as well as [[Hyundai Motor Group]] having its two mainstream brands, [[Kia Motors]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company]] focusing on performance and mid-luxury, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (Among the American press, it has drawn comparisons to the decades-long set up of [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]] at [[General Motors]] before the phase-out of Pontiac in 2010.) As part of the restructuring, Dodge will discontinue the [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] (after 32 years) and [[Dodge Avenger]] without replacements, while launching a sporty [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] below the Dart in 2018. Additionally, while the [[Ram Trucks]] division will remain separate (although the [[Dodge Durango]] will remain in production as a Dodge), the [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]] division was merged back into Dodge.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jerry |last=Hirsh |first2=David |last2=Unredcoffler |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-chrysler-revamp-20140507-story.html#page=1 |title=Fiat Chrysler unveils aggressive five-year plan |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Dodge trucks==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 320\n | header = Dodge and Ram emblems\n | image1 = Dodge Ram pickup hood ornament sop.jpg\n | caption1 =\n | image2 =\n | caption2 =\n | footer = Ram hood ornaments adorned every Dodge car and truck from 1932 to 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/corporate/bios/fairbanks.html|title=Avard T.

Although the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, Ram President Fred Diaz has said:\n\n<blockquote>Ram trucks will always and forever be Dodges. Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be ''<nowiki>'vinned'</nowiki>'' (from the acronym [[VIN]], or Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/01/ram-trucks-will-always-be-dodges-ram-president-says.html|title=Ram Trucks Will Always Be Dodges, Ram President Says - PickupTrucks.com News |website=news.pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pickups and medium to heavy trucks===\n[[File:1934 Dodge Brothers 2-ton stake truck red.jpg|thumb|right|1934 Dodge K-34 stake bed truck]]\nEver since Dodge began building their own cars in 1914, the company also offered light truck models. Initially, these were largely based on the existing passenger cars, but eventually gained their own chassis and body designs as the market matured. During the 1930s and 1940s, light- and medium-duty models were offered at first, then a heavy-duty range was added. The very large, new [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant was built in Michigan, just north of Detroit, and opened in 1938, producing Dodge trucks ever since.\n\nIn 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks were crucially redesigned\u2014not only receiving a new \"Fore-Point\" (similar to Cab Forward) design of the front side and cab\u2014but especially, the old car frames were dropped and for the first time replaced by modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails ''welded'' to the cross members.<ref name=AllparRam /> These welded frames were from here on introduced on half-ton to one-ton rated trucks, expanding Dodge into a heavier truck market segment than before.\n\nIn 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned [[Dodge T-, V-, W-Series|line of pickups and trucks]], with streamlined new, 'art-deco' front sheetmetal styling. Introducing the concept of \"Job-Rated\", Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit every job they were buying it for.<ref name=AllparRam>{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921-1953 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Allpar |access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> From the 1939 'Job-Rated' trucks onwards, Dodge's light and medium trucks were built in its 'Mound Road\" plant in Warren, Michigan.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] and the successful application of [[four-wheel drive]] to the truck line, Dodge introduced a civilian version that it called the [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagon]]. At first based almost exactly on the military-type design, variants of the standard truck line were eventually given 4WD and the same \"Power Wagon\" name.\n\nDodge was among the first to introduce car-like features to its trucks, adding the plush Adventurer package during the 1960s and offering sedan-like space in its Club Cab bodies of the 1970s. Declining sales and increased competition during the 1970s eventually forced the company to drop its medium- and heavy-duty models, an arena the company has only recently begun to reenter.\n\nDodge introduced what they called the \"Adult Toys\" line to boost its truck sales in the late 1970s, starting off with the limited edition Lil' Red Express pickup (featuring, a 360 c.i. police interceptor engine and visible [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]]-style [[exhaust system|exhaust]] stacks). Later came the more widely available [[Dodge Warlock|Warlock]]. Other \"Adult Toys\" from Dodge included the \"Macho Power Wagon\" and \"Street Van\".\n\nAs part of a general decline in the commercial vehicle field during the 1970s, Dodge eliminated their [[Dodge LCF Series|LCF Series]] heavy-duty trucks in 1975, along with the Bighorn and medium-duty D-Series trucks, and affiliated S Series [[school bus]]es were dropped in 1978. On the other hand, Dodge produced several thousand pickups for the [[United States armed forces|United States Military]] under the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle|CUCV]] program from the late 1970s into the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:89RamF34.jpg|thumb|1989 Dodge Ram pickup]]\nContinuing financial problems meant that even Dodge's light-duty models \u2013 renamed as the [[Dodge Ram|Ram Pickup]] line for 1981 \u2013 were carried over with the most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize Dodge's fortunes during this time. One was the introduction of [[Cummins]]' powerful and reliable [[Cummins B Series engine|B Series]] turbo-[[diesel engine]] as an option for 1989. This innovation raised Dodge's profile among consumers who needed power for towing or large loads. The second was a class-exclusive V8 engine option for the mid-sized [[Dodge Dakota|Dakota]] pickup.\n\nDodge introduced the Ram's all-new \"big-rig\" styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly [[Attitude polarization|polarizing]] looks, exposure was also gained by usage of the new truck on the hit TV show ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]]. The new Ram also featured a totally new interior with a console box big enough to hold a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins [[turbodiesel]] remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned for 1997 using the big rig styling, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive \"face\" that set them apart from the competition.\n\nThe Ram was redesigned again for 2002, and the Dakota in 2005, and was basically an evolution of the original, but adding the Hemi V8 engine to the list of available options, due to the revival of the legendary Chrysler Hemi V8 engine. New medium duty chassis cab models were introduced for 2007 with standard Cummins turbodiesel power as a way of gradually getting Dodge back into the business truck market again.\n\nFor a time during the 1980s, Dodge imported a line of small pickups from Mitsubishi, known as the D50, or later the [[Dodge Ram 50|Ram 50]] and were carried on as a stopgap until the Dakota's sales eventually made the imported trucks irrelevant. Reversing the role, Mitsubishi has more recently purchased Dakota pickups from Dodge and restyled them into their own [[Mitsubishi Raider|Raider]] line for sale in North America.\n\n===Vans===\nDodge had offered panel delivery models for many years since its founding, but their first purpose-built van model arrived for 1964 with the compact [[Dodge A100|A Series]]. Based on the Dodge Dart platform and using its proven six-cylinder or V8 engines, the A-series was a strong competitor for both its domestic rivals (from Ford and Chevrolet/[[GMC Truck|GMC]]) and the diminutive [[Volkswagen Transporter]] line.\n\nAs the market evolved, Dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future, and thus the [[Dodge B Series|B Series]] was introduced for 1971, and offered both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds. Like the trucks, Chrysler's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the [[Dodge Ram Van|Ram Van]] and [[Dodge Ram Wagon|Ram Wagon]] for 1981, this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003.\n[[File:2001-2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.jpg|thumb|right|2001\u20132004 [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]]]]\n\nThe DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998 made it possible for Dodge to explore new ideas; hence the European-styled [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] line of vans was brought over and given a Dodge styling treatment. Redesigned for 2006 as a 2007 model, the economical diesel-powered Sprinters have become very popular for city usage among delivery companies like [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in recent years. Because of their fuel efficiency major motorhome manufacturer Thor Motor Coach made several Class C and Class A [[Motorhomes]] available on the Dodge Sprinter Chassis including their popular Four Winds Siesta & Chateau Citation product lines.\n\nDodge also offered a cargo version of its best-selling Caravan for many years, at first calling it the Mini Ram Van, which was a name originally applied to the short-wheelbase B Series Ram Vans, and later naming it the Caravan C/V, the C/V stood for Cargo Van. For model year 2012, the Caravan C/V was rebranded as a Ram, and was renamed the Ram C/V.\n\n===Sport utility vehicles===\nDodge's first experiments with anything like a sport utility vehicle appeared in the late 1950s with a windowed version of their standard panel-truck \u2013 known as the [[Dodge Town Wagon|Town Wagon]]. These were built in the same style through the mid-1960s.\n\nBut the division did not enter the SUV arena in earnest until 1974, with the purpose-built [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ramcharger]]. Offering the then-popular open body style and Dodge's powerful V8 engines, the Ramcharger was a strong competitor for trucks like the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[International Harvester Scout]] II.\n\nOnce again, though, Dodge was left with outdated products during the 1980s as the market evolved. The Ramcharger hung on through 1993 with only minor updates. When the Ram truck was redesigned for the 1994 model year, the Ramcharger was discontinued in the American and Canadian markets. A version using the updated styling was made for the Mexican Market but was never imported to the U.S. or Canada.\n\nInstead, Dodge tried something new in 1997. Using the mid-sized Dakota pickup's chassis as a base, they built the four-door [[Dodge Durango|Durango]] SUV with seating for eight people and created a new niche. Sized between smaller SUVs (like the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]]) and larger models (like the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Ford Expedition]]), Durango was both a bit more and bit less{{original research inline|date=May 2012}} of everything. The redesigned version for 2004 grew a little bit in every dimension, becoming a full-size SUV (and thus somewhat less efficient), but was still sized between most of its competitors on either side of the aisle. For 2011 a new unibody Durango based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee was released. The 2011 Durango shrank slightly to size comparable to the original model.\n\nDodge also imported a version of Mitsubishi's popular Montero ([[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] in Japan) as the [[Dodge Raider|Raider]] from 1987 to 1989.\n\n=== High performance vehicles ===\nFrom the late 20th century onwards, Dodge's highest performing vehicles fell under the category [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]]. These models often came equipped with high performance V8s under the hood. These models included the [[Dodge Challenger]] SRT (2008\u2013current), [[Dodge Charger]] SRT (2006\u2013current), [[Dodge Magnum]] SRT (2006\u20132008) and [[Dodge Durango]] SRT (2018-current-). They also produced the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] (2003\u20132005), [[Dodge Caliber]] SRT-4 (2008\u20132009), [[Dodge Viper]] (1991\u20132010; 2012\u20132017), and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]] (2004\u20132006). In 2015, [[Chrysler|FCA]] introduced the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hellcat|Hellcat]], a 707 HP, [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L [[Hemispherical combustion chamber|HEMI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. In 2017, Dodge released the [[Dodge Challenger]] Demon. It is powered by an 840 HP [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L HEMI [[V8 engine|V8]], and comes from the factory with a toolbox known as the \"Demon Toolbox\" that has everything a buyer will need to drag race, including the skinny front drag tires. However, buyers will only get 840 HP on race fuel. On regular pump gas, it produces 808 HP, a 101 HP increase over the Hellcat.\n\n==International markets==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Dodge Polara (Argentina).jpg|thumb|right|An Argentine Dodge Polara, produced from 1968 to 1980]]\n\nDodge came to Argentina in the early 20th century with imported cars and trucks. In 1960, it partnered with Fevre-Basset as a local manufacturer. The first vehicle made in Argentina was the D-100 \"Sweptline\" pickup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |title=Dodge Sweptline |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=August 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821234742/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |archivedate=August 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Between 1961 and 1980, a variety of trucks were produced, including the D-400/DP-400,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-400.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D/DP-400 |work=camionargentino |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> D-500<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2016/02/dodge-d-500-4x4.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D-500 4x4|first=Matias|last=Lerch|date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>/DP-500,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-500.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D/DP-500 |work=camionargentino |date=March 22, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> DP600,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/06/dodge-dp-600.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DP-600 |work=camionargentino |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> DD900<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-dd-900.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DD-900 |work=camionargentino |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> and DD1000 (the last two with one curiosity: the air-cooled [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engine rather Perkins or Chrysler<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/08/dodge-dd-1000.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DD-1000 |work=camionargentino |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>). Passenger cars were also produced, namely the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant I and II]], and the local versions of the 1966 [[Dodge Dart]] (called Valiant III and IV). In 1971, the Dodge 1500, a rebadged [[Hillman Avenger]] from the United Kingdom was introduced. In 1982, production of Dodge vehicles ceased when German company [[Volkswagen]] bought the Fevre plant and the shares.\n\nIn Argentina, the name \"Polara\" was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the fourth generation North American [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]]. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980, by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.<ref name=\"Chrysler Argentina \">{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |title=Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115144202/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |date=May 18, 2009 |language=Spanish |archivedate=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Dodge began marketing cars and pick-ups directly in Argentina. Currently, both the Journey and the Ram are available to Argentine customers.\n\n===Asia===\nDodge entered the Japanese market in mid-2007, and re-entered the Chinese market in late 2007. [[Soueast Motors]] of China assembles the Caravan for the Chinese market. Dodge began marketing its vehicles in South Korea in 2004, starting with the Dakota.\n\n===Australia===\nDodge re-entered the Australian market in 2006 with the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]], their first offering since the AT4/D5N trucks in 1979 and the first Dodge passenger car to be marketed in Australia since the [[Dodge Phoenix|Phoenix]] sedan was discontinued in 1973. The second model to be introduced was the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]], with the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] and [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] followed. Dodge chose not use the full model lines and engines available to them, the 2.7&nbsp;L V6 being available in the Journey and Avenger instead of the 3.2&nbsp;L in the North American versions. However, diesel engines were introduced in all their cars.\nFollowing the Global Financial Crisis, Chrysler introduced the facelifted model of the Caliber and discontinued the Avenger imports. From early 2012 on, model year 2010 cars were available. By early 2012 no new cars were being brought into Australia aside from the new facelifted 2012 Journey.\n\nThere were rumors that Dodge cars will be re-badged as Fiats in the Australian market as was the case in Europe. The Dodge nameplate continued due to consistent sales of the Journey.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bruce |last=Newton |url= http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2012/fiat-punto-heading-back-to-australia-32839 |title=Fiat Punto heading back to Australia |publisher=carpoint.com.au |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> However, the brand was discontinued in the Australian market after 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Maclean |first=Andrew |title=Dodge brand dropped from Australia - Dodge disappears from Australia |url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/dodge-brand-dropped-from-australia-20161014-gs2od1 |website=Drive |accessdate=6 December 2019 |language=en-au |date=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nIn Brazil, Dodge cars were produced between 1969 and 1981 with the models Dart, Charger, Magnum, LeBaron (all powered by the same 318&nbsp;cid V8 engine), and the compact 1800/Polara, based on the British [[Hillman Avenger]]. The manufacturer was acquired by Volkswagen in 1981. In 1998, the Dakota pickup started production in a new plant in [[Campo Largo, Paran\u00e1]] by [[Mercedes-Benz]], which belongs to its former partner [[Daimler AG]]. It was built there until 2001 with petrol and diesel engines and regular, extended and crew cabs. In 2010, Dodge started sales of the imported pickup Ram 2500. The model portfolio is being expanded, starting with the Journey crossover for the 2009 model year.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, the Dodge lineup of cars started down the road to elimination along with the Plymouth line when in 1988 the [[Dodge Dynasty]] was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty and sold at both Plymouth and Dodge dealers. Similarly, the new [[Dodge Intrepid]], the Dynasty's replacement, was sold as the Chrysler Intrepid.\n\nFor 2000, the new Neon became the Chrysler Neon. The Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped. Dodge trucks, which have been sold at Canadian Plymouth dealers since 1973, continued without change. All Plymouth-Chrysler and Dodge-Chrysler dealers became Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealers.\n\nThe diluting of the Chrysler name did not go well in Canada, especially as the nameplate had been pushed as a luxury line since the 1930s. For 2003, the revamped Neon appeared in Canada as the Dodge SX 2.0. Since then, all new Dodge models have been sold in Canada under the Dodge name.\n\n===Europe===\nDodge started assembling lorries (trucks) in the United Kingdom from imported parts in 1922. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis at its works in [[Kew]], using American engines and gearboxes.<ref>{{cite web|author=doctor colin |url= http://www.dodge50.co.uk/dodgehistory.htm |title=1922 To 1983 a brief history of Dodge in the U.K. |publisher=Dodge50.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Right-hand drive Dodge trucks\n{{gallery | height = 120\n|File:Dodge D 15.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:Preserved dodge, Limestone Museum, Malta Siggiewa. feb 2011 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:1952 Dodge Kew \"Parrot Nose\" truck in red.jpg|1952 Kew-built Dodge D100\n}}\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Dodge Kew was part of the [[London Aircraft Production Group]], building fuselage sections for [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers. The pre-war and wartime truck range was replaced by the [[Dodge 100 \"Kew\"]] truck (1949\u20131957), nicknamed the \"parrot nose\" due to the sculpted lines of its bonnet. Subsequent normal-control Dodges built at Kew were the 200 series (1957\u20131963) and the 400 series (1963\u20131965). The 400 series was a version of the American [[Dodge D series|D series]] medium-duty models. Also built at Kew were the [[Cab over|cab-over]] [[Dodge 300|300 series]] (1957\u20131965) and its successor the [[Dodge 500|500 series/K-series]] (1964\u20131978) tilt-cab. In 1964 Chrysler acquired its first stake in the British [[Rootes Group]] and it was decided to consolidate all truck production at Rootes' factory in Dunstable. British assembly of the 400 series was discontinued due to declining sales of normal-control trucks, and production of the 500 series was transferred to Dunstable in 1967.\n\nIn some export markets British-built Dodge trucks used the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] or [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] marques, and the situation was further complicated after takeover of the Rootes Group whose commercial vehicles were sold under the [[Commer]] and [[Karrier]] marques. Some Dodge 500s were given Commer badges, whilst the [[Dodge 100 \"Commando\"|100 series \"Commando\"]] light truck (1970\u20131989) developed by Rootes was initially marketed under all five marques. In the UK market Commers were usually lighter than Dodges, whereas the Karrier marque tended to be used on vehicles sold to public sector operators such as local authorities. Some of the smaller Commer/Karrier vans were also sold as Fargos in export markets. In 1976 Chrysler Europe rationalised its marques and thereafter all the British-built commercial vehicles were sold as Dodges or (increasingly rarely) Karriers. This included the smaller [[Commer FC|Commer SpaceVan]] (1960\u20131983) and [[Commer Walk-Thru]] (1961\u20131979), which became Dodges for their final years. The van and pick-up versions of Chrysler Europe's French-built [[Simca 1100]] were also branded as Dodges in Britain from 1976, although they remained Simcas elsewhere (and became Talbots in Britain after 1979).\n\nAmerican Chrysler Corporation cars, including some Dodge models, were assembled from [[Knock-down kit|CKD]] kits at various locations in Europe until the 1970s, including Kew (1920s-30s), Antwerp (1926\u20131958) and Rotterdam (1958\u20131970), but sales volumes were low as even 'compact' American cars like the [[Dodge Dart]] were enormous [[gas-guzzler]]s by European standards. However, [[protectionist]] policies in some countries encouraged small local manufacturers to license-build CKD models, including [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren|AMAG]] in Switzerland (building Chryslers and Dodges 1948\u20131972) and [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] in Spain (building Dodge Darts from 1965 as the Barreiros Dart). By 1969 Chrysler had acquired full control of Barreiros, and Darts were being exported to other European countries under the Dodge name (precipitating closure of the Rotterdam plant). From 1970 the Spanish-built Dart was replaced by the Barreiros/Dodge 3700 which remained in production until 1977. The Dodge cars were a relatively small part of the Madrid factory's output, which was dominated by smaller Simca-designed cars and Barreiros-designed heavy duty trucks. From 1972 such trucks were sold as the [[Dodge 300]] (though unrelated to the earlier British 300 series), which was available as 4\u00d72, 6\u00d74, 8\u00d72 and 8\u00d74 rigids, as well as 4\u00d72 semi-trailer tractors.\n\nFollowing Chrysler Europe's collapse in 1977 and the sale of their assets to [[Peugeot]], the van and truck range and the associated factories in Dunstable and Madrid were quickly passed on to [[Renault Trucks|Renault V\u00e9hicules Industriels]]. Chrysler licensed the Dodge name to be used on Renault trucks sold in certain European markets \u2013 most notably the United Kingdom. However the only subsequent new model to carry the Dodge name was the [[Dodge 50 series]] (1979\u20131992), which replaced the earlier Walk-Thru and was widely used in Britain by utility companies, the military and as a minibus, but was rarely seen outside the UK. Thereafter all new models were Renaults, and in 1987 the Dodge name was dropped from the remaining inherited models (50 and Commando), which became Renaults for their last few years of production.\n\nDodge vehicles would not return to Europe until the introduction of the Neon, badged as a Chrysler, in the mid-1990s.\n\nChrysler reintroduced the Dodge marque to Europe on a broad scale in 2006, with a lineup consisting of North American-built Caliber, Avenger, Viper SRT-10, Nitro and [[Dodge Journey]] cars and SUVs, but this proved to be a short-lived return due to the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and the takeover of Chrysler by Fiat. In 2010 the Dodge marque was pulled from the UK due to poor sales<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/05/19/dodge-stops-selling-nitro-caliber-in-uk/ |title=Dodge stops selling Nitro, Caliber in UK |publisher=Autoblog |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> and on June 1, 2011 it was dropped from the rest of Europe. All of the Dodge models were discontinued in Europe except the Dodge Journey, which became the [[Fiat Freemont]] (and which was not available in the right-hand-drive Ireland or UK markets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofacil.es/problemas-coche/2011/07/11/pasa-tienes-chrysler-o-dodge/7432.html |title=Qu\u00e9 pasa si tienes un Chrysler o Dodge|publisher=Autof\u00e1cil (Luike) |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, the [[Hyundai Accent]], [[Hyundai Atos]], and [[Hyundai Porter|Hyundai H100]] were branded as \"Dodge\", [[Dodge Attitude]], \"Verna by Dodge\", \"Atos by Dodge\" and \"Dodge H100\" respectively, and sold at Chrysler/Dodge dealers. Current models are marketed with Hyundai logos instead of the \"Ram\" logo on previous model years since 2014. Dodge and Hyundai ended the venture and Dodge will use rebadged and reworked Fiats (2014). Also, to the next year with [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] is sold as the new Dodge Attitude since 2015.\n\n==Logos==\n* Star: The original Dodge was a circle, with two Greek [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] intertwined representing the letter \"[[D]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/world/canada/3-dodge.html |title=History of Dodge Brothers |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref> forming a six-pointed star in the middle; an interlocked \"DB\" was at the center of the star, and the words \"Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicles\" encircled the outside edge. Although similar to the [[Star of David]], the Dodge brothers were not [[Jewish]]; they were [[Methodist]]s. Although the \"Brothers\" was dropped from the name for trucks in 1929 and cars in 1930, the DB star remained in the cars until the 1939 models were introduced.\n* Ram: For 1932 Dodge cars adopted a leaping ram as the car's hood ornament. Starting with the 1940 models the leaping ram became more streamlined and by 1951 only the head, complete with curving horns, remained. The 1954 model cars were the last to use the ram's head before the reintroduction in the 1980s. Dodge trucks adopted the ram as the hood ornament for the 1940 model year with the 1950 models as the last.\n* Crest: For 1941 Dodge introduced a crest, supposedly the Dodge family crest. The design had four horizontal bars broken in the middle by one vertical bar with an \"O\" in the center. A knight's head appeared at the top of the emblem. Although the head would be dropped for 1955, the emblem would survive through 1957 and reappear on the 1976 Aspen. The crest would be used through to 1981 on its second time around, being replaced by the Pentastar for 1982. The knight's head without the crest would be used for 1959.\n* Forward Look: Virgil Exner's radical Forward Look redesign of Chrysler's vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by the adoption of a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting [[space age]] rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, and accessories through September 1962.\n* Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a fractured [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo first appeared on the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers came up with the meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1962-1964-dodge-8802.htm |title=1962\u20131964 Dodge 880 article |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sealey |first=Mike |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/logos.html |title=Mike Sealey's history of Chrysler's logos |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as steering wheel center hubs and road wheel covers.\n* Pentastar: From 1982 to 1995, Dodge used Chrysler's [[Pentastar]] logo on its cars and trucks to replace the Dodge crest, although it had been used for corporate recognition since late 1962. In advertisements and on dealer signage, Dodge's Pentastar was red, while Chrysler-Plymouth's was blue.\n* [[Ram Trucks|Ram]]'s head: Dodge reintroduced the ram's head hood ornament on the new 1973 Dodge Bighorn heavy duty tractor units. Gradually the ram's head began appearing on the pickup trucks as Dodge began to refer to their trucks as Ram. The present iteration of the [[Bighorn sheep|Ram]]'s-head logo appeared in late 1992 on the 1993 Intrepid, standardizing on that logo in 1996 for all vehicles except the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which uses the [[Viperidae|Viper's]] Head.\n* New logo: In 2010, with the separation of the Ram brand, two new Dodge logos were unveiled. The first logo features the word \"DODGE\" with two red inclined stripes. It was originally used strictly for marketing purposes, however Dodge introduced the logo onto the grilles of the 2012 lineup.\n\nA second emblem was revealed during the unveiling of the 2011 Durango, which used the same five-point shield-shaped outline of the old emblem, but with the ram's head replaced with a chrome cross reminiscent of the brand's signature cross-haired grille.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/|title=New Dodge emblem revealed |publisher=VehiCast |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112925/http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/ |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> This was only used on the [[steering wheel]]. In 2014, the cross logo was replaced by the word \"DODGE\" on the Durango steering wheel. A modified version of the Ram's head logo is still used for the Ram brand, with \"RAM\" written across the bottom in bold white or black lettering.\n\n===Dodge logo evolution===\n<gallery>\nFile:DodgeBros.JPG|Dodge Brothers emblem c. 1910, removed from the gate of the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|\"Dodge Main\"]] before its 1981 demolition\nFile:Dodge Brothers logo.svg|1914 Dodge Brothers logo\nFile:Forward Look D100.jpg|Forward Look, 1955\u20131962\nFile:1965 Dodge Dart 270, pict9.JPG|Fratzog, 1962\u20131981\nFile:Dodge Red Pentastar.svg|Red Chrysler Pentastar logo, 1966\u20131996\nFile:A new Dodge logo.png|Variant of 2010 logo\nFile:Dodge logo 2010.png|Textured metal word, 2010\u2013 <ref>{{cite web|title=Brand New: Dodge Loses its Horns |url=http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/dodge_loses_its_horns.php|website=underconsideration.com|date=May 26, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\nFile:Dodge logo bars.png|Current Dodge logo\n</gallery>\n\n==Slogans==\n* Dependability, The Dependables.

The factory was located in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], and was called the [[Dodge Main|Dodge Main factory]] from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. \n\nDodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of [[truck]]s and [[Full-size car|full-sized]] passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made compact cars (such as the 1963\u201376 [[Dodge Dart|Dart]]) and midsize cars (such as the \"B-Body\" [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] and [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] from 1966\u201378).\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]] of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K [[automobile platform|platform]] and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the [[Dodge Caravan]].\n\nThe Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its short-lived merger with [[Daimler AG|Daimler-Benz AG]] from 1998 to 2007,<ref>{{cite web |title=Company History - \"World Corp.\" vision: the merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler (1995 - 2007) |url=https://www.daimler.com/company/tradition/company-history/1995-2007.html |publisher=Daimler |date=2019 |quote=On 7 May 1998, Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft in Germany and Chrysler Corporation in the United States of America signed a merger contract. |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> its subsequent sale to [[Cerberus Capital Management]], its 2009 [[Effects of the 2008\u20132010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|bailout by the United States government]], and its subsequent [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and acquisition by [[Fiat]].\n\nIn 2011, Dodge and its model sub-brands, [[Ram Trucks|Dodge Ram]], and [[Dodge Viper]] were separated. Dodge said that the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] would be an [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] product and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] will be a standalone marque. In 2014, [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]] was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, [[Chrysler|Chrysler Group]] was renamed [[FCA US LLC]], corresponding with the merger of [[Fiat S.p.A.]] and Chrysler Group into the single corporate structure of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 230\n | header = The Dodge brothers\n | image1 = John Francis Dodge.jpg\n | caption1 = John Francis Dodge\n | image2 = Horace Elgin Dodge.jpg\n | caption2 = Horace Elgin Dodge }}\n\n===Founding and early years===\n[[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace]] and [[John Francis Dodge|John Dodge]] founded the ''Dodge Brothers'' Company in Detroit in 1900, and quickly found work manufacturing precision engine and [[chassis]] components for the city's growing number of automobile firms.

Henry Ford selected the Dodge brothers to supply a wide range of components for his original [[Ford Model A (1903\u201304)|Model A (1903\u201304)]] that included the complete chassis; thus Ford needed to add only the body and wheels to finish the cars.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeLorenzo |first=Matt |title=Dodge 100 Years |date=2014 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9781627880848 |pages=8\u20139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zm91AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Henry offered the Dodge brothers a 10% share in his new company in return for $10,000 worth of goods.\n\nThe first machine shop where the brothers worked as parts suppliers for Olds and Ford was located at the Boydell Building on Beaubien Street at Lafayette. This location was replaced by a larger facility at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue, which is now a parking garage for the [[Greektown Casino Hotel]] (Hastings Street at this location has been renamed Chrysler Service Drive).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgemotorcar.com/history/early_history.php |title=Locations of earlier Dodge Brothers workshops |publisher=Dodgemotorcar.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> By 1910 the [[Dodge Main]] factory was built in Hamtramck, where it remained until 1979.\n\n[[File:1915-dodge-archives.jpg|right|thumb|1915 Model 30-35 touring car]]\n[[File:Royal baking trucks.jpg|thumb|Dodge Brothers delivery trucks, [[Salt Lake City]], 1920]]\n[[File:Light-repair-truck-FAJ19200910.jpg|thumb|[[M1918 light repair truck]] [[G-numbers|G10]], likely U.S. Army (Field Artillery Journal Sep-Oct 1920)]]\n\nThe Dodge Brothers Motor Company was established in 1913 and by 1914, John and Horace designed and debuted the first car of their own \u2013 the four-cylinder Dodge Model 30/35 touring car.<ref>{{cite web |title=This day in history: January 14: Dodge co-founder dies |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dodge-co-founder-dies |author=History.com Editors |publisher=A&E Television Networks |date=August 21, 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Marketed as a slightly more upscale competitor to the ubiquitous [[Ford Model T]], it pioneered or made standard many features later taken for granted, like all-steel body construction (as the vast majority of cars worldwide still used wood-framing under steel panels);<ref group=nb>though Stoneleigh and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] used steel bodies as early as 1911</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Tom |editor-last=Northey |last=Wise |first=David Burgess |chapter=Dodge |title=The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |publisher=Purnell Reference Books |year=1977 |volume=5 |page=552 |isbn=978-0-8393-6009-4}}</ref> 12-volt electrical system (6-volt systems would remain the norm until the 1950s); 35 horsepower<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1920_Dodge_Brothers/1920_Dodge_Brothers_Brochure/1920%20Dodge%20Brothers-19.html |title=1920 Dodge Brothers Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> engines versus the Model T's 20 horsepower, and sliding-gear [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] (the best-selling Model T would retain an antiquated planetary design until its demise in 1927).

During this time, the Model 30 was evolved to become the new Series 116 (though it retained the same basic construction and engineering features). However, as the 1920s progressed, Dodge gradually lost its ranking as the third best-selling automobile manufacturer, slipping down to seventh in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, Dodge Brothers expanded the truck line and became a leading builder of light trucks. After greatly expanding production capacity, in 1921 Haynes signed a contract whereby Dodge's vast dealer network would exclusively market trucks with bodies built by Graham Brothers of Evansville, Indiana. This Graham truck line from then on used only Dodge-built chassis, from 1-ton to 3-ton capacity, and Dodge kept making light-duty trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\">{{cite web|url= https://forums.aaca.org/topic/210257-my-1934-dodge-4x4-15-ton/ |title=my 1934 Dodge 4x4 1.5 ton - Dodge Trucks |work=Antique Automobile Club of America - Discussion Forums |date=June 5, 2019 |accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStagnation in development was becoming apparent, however, and the public responded by dropping Dodge Brothers to fifth place in the industry by 1925. That year, the Dodge Brothers company was sold by the widows to the well-known investment group [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] for no less than US$146&nbsp;million (at the time, the largest cash transaction in history).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://usjunkyardsnearme.com/car-resources/dodge-history/ |title=Dodge History |publisher=usjunkyardsnearme.com |accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDillon, Read & Co. offered non-voting stock on the market in the new Dodge Brothers firm, and along with the sale of bonds was able to raise $160&nbsp;million, reaping a $14&nbsp;million (net) profit. All voting stock was retained by Dillon, Read. Frederick Haynes remained as company head until E.G. Wilmer was named board chairman in November, 1926. Wilmer was a banker with no auto experience and Haynes remained as president. Changes to the car, save for superficial things like [[trim level]]s and colors, remained minimal until 1927, when the new Senior six-cylinder line was introduced. The former four-cylinder line was kept on, but renamed the [[Dodge Fast Four|Fast Four]] line until it was dropped in favor of two lighter six-cylinder models (the Standard Six and Victory Six) for 1928.\n\nOn October 1, 1925, Dodge Brothers, Inc., acquired a 51% interest in [[Graham Brothers]], Inc., for $13&nbsp;million and the remaining 49% on May 1, 1926. Haynes purchased all of Graham's truck activity, and in 1926, the Graham branch took charge of all of Dodge's truck manufacturing.

The brothers established the [[Graham-Paige]] company to build a new line of Graham passenger cars.\n\nDespite all this, Dodge Brothers' sales had already dropped to seventh place in the industry by 1927, and Dillon, Read began looking for someone to take over the company on a more permanent basis. Eventually Dodge was sold to the new Chrysler Corporation in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://gearheads.org/the-dodge-motor-company/ |title=The Dodge Motor Company |date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Gear Heads |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> On January 2, 1929, Chrysler announced that the Graham Badge was dropped, and Dodge Brothers were building Chrysler's trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\"/>\n\n===Pre-war years===\n[[File:1933 Dodge advert by Muray.jpg|thumb|Dodge aimed for the luxury market in this advertisement for the 1933 model Eight]]\nTo fit better in the Chrysler Corporation lineup, alongside low-priced [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and medium-priced [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], Dodge's lineup for early 1930 was trimmed down to a core group of two lines and thirteen models (from three lines and nineteen models just over a year previous). Prices started out just above DeSoto but were somewhat less than top-of-the-line [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]], in a small-scale recreation of [[General Motors Companion Make Program|General Motors' \"step-up\" marketing concept]]. (DeSoto and Dodge would swap places in the market for the 1933 model year, Dodge dropping down between Plymouth and DeSoto.) As Plymouth cars were sold at Chrysler dealerships, Dodge branded vehicles were sold as a lower cost alternative to DeSoto.\n\nFor 1930, Dodge took another step up by adding a new eight-cylinder line to replace the existing Senior six-cylinder. This basic format of a dual line with Six and Eight models continued through 1933, and the cars were gradually streamlined and lengthened in step with prevailing trends of the day. The Dodge Eight was replaced by a larger Dodge DeLuxe Six for 1934, which was dropped for 1935. A long-[[wheelbase]] edition of the remaining Six was added for 1936 and would remain a part of the lineup for many years. To enhance production, in 1932 Chrysler built a factory in [[Los Angeles (Maywood) Assembly|Los Angeles, California]] where Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge and Plymouth vehicles were built until the factory closed in 1971.\n[[File:1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck]]\n[[File:Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939.jpg|thumb|Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939]]\n\nThe Dodge line, along with most of the corporation's output, was restyled in the so-called \"Wind Stream\" look for 1935. This was a mild form of [[streamliner|streamlining]], which saw sales jump remarkably over the previous year (even though Dodge as a whole still dropped to fifth place for the year after two years of holding down fourth). Dodge never got the radical [[Airflow Chrysler|Airflow]] styling that was the cause of depressed sales of Chryslers and DeSotos from 1934 to 1937, as a passenger sedan, but it was used on commercial truck for a short time. Dodge (along with the rest of Chrysler) added safety features such as a smooth, flat dashboard with no protruding knobs, curved in door handles, and padded front-seat backs for the benefit of the rear-seat occupants.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1940_Dodge/1940_Dodge_Brochure/1940%20Dodge-09-10.html |title=1940 Dodge Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother major restyle arrived for the 25th-anniversary 1939 models, which Dodge dubbed the Luxury Liner series. These were once again completely redesigned, with new bodies for 1940, again in 1941, and a refreshing for 1942. However, just after the 1942 models were introduced, Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] forced the shutdown of Dodge's passenger car [[assembly line]]s in favor of [[Military production during World War II|war production]] in February 1942. 1941 saw the introduction of Fluid Drive for Dodge cars, which eliminated stalling or bucking if the clutch were released too quickly. This feature put a fluid coupling in between the engine and the clutch, although the driver still had to shift gears manually.\n\n===World War II===\nChrysler was prolific in its production of [[Materiel|war materiel]], especially from 1942 to 1945.

The \"[[supply and demand|seller's market]]\" of the early [[postwar]] years, brought on by the lack of any new cars throughout the war, meant that every automaker found it easy to sell vehicles regardless of any drawbacks they might have. Like almost every other automaker, Dodge sold lightly [[facelift (product)|facelifted]] revisions of its 1942 design through the 1948 season. As before, these were a single series of six-cylinder models with two trim levels (basic Deluxe or plusher Custom). From 1949 until 1954, Fluid Drive could be combined with \"Gyro-Matic,\" a semi-automatic transmission which reduced (but did not eliminate) the need to shift gears.\n\nStyling was not initially Dodge's strong point during this period, though that began to change by 1953 under the direction of corporate design chief [[Virgil Exner]].  However the deluxe Coronet series, introduced for 1949, offered extra luxury as the top of the line.  The Coronet Diplomat, Dodge's first pillarless hardtop coupe, was new for 1950, at least one year before Ford, Plymouth, and other popular car makes offered it.  At the same time, Dodge also introduced its first V8 engine \u2013 the Red Ram Hemi, a smaller version of the original design of the famed [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Chrysler Hemi]]. The new 1953 bodies were smaller and based on the Plymouth. For 1954, sales dropped, the stubby styling not going over well with the public. 1954 also saw the introduction of the fully automatic PowerFlite transmission.\n\nChrysler borrowed $250 million from [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] in 1954 to finance expansion, acquisition, and updating the outdated styling of their car lines that was contributed to Chrysler failing to benefit from the postwar boom as GM and Ford were.<ref>{{cite book|last=Genat |first=Robert |title=Mopar Muscle |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590839 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yARkK-FHHO8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |year=2004 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jefferys |first=Steve |title=Management and Managed: Fifty Years of Crisis at Chrysler |year=1986 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=9780521304412 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1954/03/02/83747978.html?pageNumber=33 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 2, 1954 |title=Chrysler Borrows $250 Million For Growth on Note Due in 2054 |pages=33, 36}}</ref>\n\nExner led creation of the new corporate \"[[Forward Look]]\" styling of 1955, beginning a new era for Dodge. With steadily upgraded styling and ever-stronger engines every year through 1960, Dodge found a ready market for its products as America discovered the joys of freeway travel. This situation improved when Dodge introduced a new line of Dodges called the Dart to do battle against Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth. The result was that Dodge sales in the middle price class collapsed. Special and regional models were sold as well, including the LaFemme (a white and orchid-trimmed hardtop marketed toward women) and the Texan, a gold-accented Dodge sold in the Lone Star State. 1957 saw the introduction of a new automatic transmission, three-speed TorqueFlite. Both PowerFlite and TorqueFlite were controlled by mechanical push-buttons until 1965.  1956 saw the introduction of the 4-door pillarless hardtop (the same year most other makes offered this body style) in all three Dodge series, Custom Royal, Royal, and Coronet.  Dodge's pillarless models were all badged \"Lancer.\"\n[[File:Dodge Coronet 1958.jpg|thumb|1958 Dodge Coronet Lancer hardtop coupe]]\n\nDodge entered the compact car field for 1961 with their new [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]], a variation on Plymouth's [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]. Though it was not initially successful, the [[Dodge Dart|Dart]] range that succeeded the Lancer in 1963 would prove to be one of the division's top sellers for many years.\n\nChrysler made an ill-advised move to downsize the Dodge and Plymouth full-size lines for 1962, which resulted in a loss of sales. However, they turned this around in 1965 by turning those former full-sizes into \"new\" mid-size models; Dodge revived the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] nameplate in this way and later added a sporty [[fastback]] version called the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] that became both a sales leader and a winner on the [[NASCAR]] circuit. Not only did this style dominate the racetrack for 4 full years, its aerodynamic improvements forever changed the face of NASCAR racing.\n\nFull-size models evolved gradually during this time. After Dodge dealers complained about not having a true full-size car in the fall of 1961, the Custom 880 was hurried into production. The Custom 880 used the 1962 Chrysler Newport body with the 1961 Dodge front end and interior. The 880 continued into 1965, the year a completely new full-size body was put into production, the [[Dodge Polara|Polara]] entered the medium price class and the [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] was added as the top series. The Polara and Monaco were changed mostly in appearance for the next ten years or so. Unique \"[[fuselage]]\" styling was employed for 1969 through 1973 and then was toned down again for the 1974 to 1977 models.\n[[File:1967 Dodge Coronet.jpg|right|thumb|1967 Dodge Coronet 440 sedan]]\n\nDodge targeted the [[muscle car]] market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Along with the Charger, models like the Coronet R/T and [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]] were popular with buyers seeking performance. The pinnacle of this effort was the introduction of the [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]] sports coupe and convertible (Dodge's entry into the \"pony car\" class ) in 1970, which offered everything from mild economy engines up to the race-ready Hemi V8 in the same package.\n\nIn an effort to reach every segment of the market, Dodge even reached a hand across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to its partner, [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and marketed their subcompact as the [[Dodge Colt|Colt]] to compete with the [[AMC Gremlin]], [[Chevrolet Vega]], and [[Ford Pinto]]. Chrysler would over the years come to rely heavily on their relationship with Mitsubishi. At the same time, Dodge got a version of the Plymouth Duster, marketed as the Dodge [[Dodge Dart#Third generation (1963\u20131966)|Demon]]. It was inexpensive, but with its slant-six engine (or V8), the Demon could not achieve the fuel economy of the four-cylinder Colt. The Demon sold in much fewer numbers than the Duster, so it is considered more collectible today, especially the V8 versions.\n\n=== 1973\u20131980 ===\n[[File:Dodge Charger (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Charger]]\n[[File:1977Diplomat.jpg|right|thumb|1977 [[Dodge Diplomat]] sedan]]\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] caused significant changes at Dodge, as well as Chrysler as a whole. Except for the Colt and Slant Six models of the Dart, Dodge's lineup was quickly seen as extremely inefficient. In fairness, this was true of most American automakers at the time, but Chrysler was also not in the best financial shape to do anything about it. Consequently, while General Motors and Ford were quick to begin downsizing their largest cars, Chrysler (and Dodge) moved more slowly out of necessity.\n\nAt the very least, Chrysler was able to use some of its other resources. Borrowing the recently introduced [[Chrysler Horizon]] from their [[Chrysler Europe|European division]], Dodge was able to get its new [[Dodge Omni|Omni]] subcompact on the market fairly quickly. At the same time, they increased the number of models imported from Japanese partner [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] starting in 1971: first came a smaller Colt (based on Mitsubishi's [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] line), then a revival of the Challenger ([[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda|Dodge Challenger]]) in 1976 as a compact hardtop coupe with nothing more than a four-cylinder under the hood, rather than the booming V8s of yore.\n\nThe 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]]. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} \"LA\" series small block V8 to three versions of {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} big block V8. The standard engine was the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225&nbsp;hp) being available as an option<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.car.info/en-se/dodge/charger/charger-se-1975-16796485|title=Dodge Charger SE 1975|website=car.info|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. \n\n1976 was the Dart's final year in the North American market. The [[rear-view mirror]] was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake performance requirements, and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart's 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille's parking lamps were cast in [[amber (color)|amber]], whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs. The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite book|last= Statham|first=Steve|title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year= 2000|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz-ItcylfasC&pg=PA124&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=NHlLS8v7GY7qygTWvpH5DQ&client=safari&cd=1#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn= 978-0-7603-0760-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> ''Car & Driver'' magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of {{convert|121.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to be second to the Corvette's {{convert|124.5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette, 1968\u20131982|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year=2000|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrPjl25HbucC&pg=PA105&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=qnlLS96JOJjCM_7j5IQO&client=safari&cd=6#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn=978-0-7603-0418-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref>\n\nDodge's replacement for the Dart was the Aspen, introduced in mid-1975 as a 1976 model.  This new design featured lighter weight resulting in slightly improved fuel economy; it also had more interior and trunk room than the Dart.  Front suspension was a new design; it featured transverse-mounted torsion bars which not only improved ride, but cornering as well.  Its boxy styling gave the impression of a larger car; however sales had to be shared with the virtually identical Plymouth Volare.  Both cars were available in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles, and in both base and deluxe trim.  Despite its virtues, customers soon found out about the Aspen's rush to market when they saw their cars experience severe body rust within a couple years on the road; engine and drive train problems plagued the Aspen/Volare twins, and although the problems were largely worked out within a few years, the final Aspens were the 1980 models.  This car was available with either a 225 cubic-inch Slant Six, or a small block V8 displacing 318 or 360 cubic inches.\n\n[[File:Dodge-Dart-sedan-2.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Dart 4-door sedan]]\n\n1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet, at least so far as the name Coronet went, also its body style choices were relegated to just only two four-door models, the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only was replaced by the [[Dodge Charger]] Sport 2-door model, which, itself, appeared for only one model year. During the next model year (1977), the mid-size Dodge Coronet would be renamed [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], which would be given stacked rectangular headlights and other minor cosmetic changes, that would provide a prompt sales boost. The Coronet and Charger were effectively replaced by the [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] for 1977, which was actually a fancier Aspen.\n\nAlso, during that same model year, the full-size Dodge Monaco would be renamed Dodge Royal Monaco, which would appear for just one model year only and after that, both Dodge and Plymouth (which would include Dodge Royal Monaco's entire Plymouth Gran Fury counterpart line up as well) would discontinue all production of any more full-size models. It lost sales every year, until finally being replaced by the [[Dodge St. Regis|St. Regis]] for 1979 following a one-year absence from the big car market. In a reversal of what happened for 1965, the St. Regis was an upsized Coronet. During the following model year (1978), the mid-size Dodge Monaco (which would include its entire Plymouth Fury counterpart line up as well) would make its final appearance (for all during the remainder of the 1970s).\n\nWhile the Aspen got accolades for styling and handling, build quality was problematic, sullying the car's reputation at the time when sales were desperately needed. It was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent stalling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Aspen also had difficulty in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} This resulted in several recalls.\n\nThe Dodge Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]. It was sold in two forms, the \"XE\" and the \"GT\" and was the last vehicle to use the long running [[Chrysler B platform]]. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded off Charger, and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for [[NASCAR]] that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975\u20131978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow [[opera window]]s, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes and seats; the suspension included Chrysler's standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with [[Lean-burn#Chrysler Electronic Lean-Burn|Lean-Burn]], while two and four-barrel carbureted {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were optional; weight was nearly {{convert|3900|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Omni and Horizon appeared at a critical time for Chrysler, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. In 1978, Chrysler had beaten out Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically-produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Rabbit]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/motoring-memories/motoring-memories-dodge-omniplymouth-horizon-1978-1990/|first=Bill |last=Vance |title=Motoring Memories: Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, 1978-1990 |publisher=autos canada |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}</ref> However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler's financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler's K-cars]], the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler's best selling model line.<ref name=RT82>{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January\u2013February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 93 }}</ref>\n\nEverything came to a head in 1979 when Chrysler's new chairman, [[Lee Iacocca]], requested and received federal loan guarantees from the [[United States Congress]] in an effort to save the company from having to file bankruptcy. With a Federal Loan in hand, Chrysler quickly set to work on new models that would leave the past behind, while reorganizing to pay the government loan which stood at 29%.\n\nThe Dodge Mirada was a [[mid-size]]d, [[rear-wheel drive]] [[coupe]] manufactured and marketed by Dodge for model years 1980 to 1983 sharing the [[Chrysler J platform]] along with its [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variants, the second generation [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged during its 4-year run, with the exception of paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty [[personal luxury car]] with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.\n\n=== 1981\u20131990 ===\n[[File:Dodge Aries sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1981\u201382 Aries Special Edition]]\n\nThe first fruit of Chrysler's crash development program was the \"[[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]]\", the Dodge version of which was the [[Dodge Aries]]. This basic and durable [[front-wheel drive]] platform spawned a whole range of new models at Dodge during the 1980s, including the groundbreaking [[Dodge Caravan]]. [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. [[Henry Ford II]] rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan \u2013 a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons.<ref name=\"allpar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref> Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using the [[Chrysler S platform]], an extended derivative of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The Caravan not only helped save Chrysler as a serious high-volume American automaker, but also spawned an entirely new market segment that supplanted the role of the station wagon: the [[minivan]]. \n\nBy 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller [[front-wheel drive]] designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler's then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at [[American Motors]] (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] to build the cars.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\">{{cite journal |url=http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143253/http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |title=Oldest Auto Plant to Make Newest V-6 |first=David C. |last=Smith |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 June 2008 |archivedate=6 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Chrysler's tooling was moved from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> This relationship evolved into Chrysler's purchase of AMC in 1987.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> Following the demise of the [[Dodge St. Regis]] R-body in 1981, the Diplomat remained, becoming the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the [[Dodge Monaco#Fifth generation (1989-92)|Monaco]] debuted as a 1990 model.\n\n[[File:1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe]]\n[[File:1989 Dodge Aries K coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1985\u20131989 Dodge Aries coupe]]\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iaccoca]] held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat's carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models:\n\n* Dodge Diplomat (5.2&nbsp;L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined\n* Chevrolet Caprice (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined\n* Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined\n\nThe Daytona originally used the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]] in [[normally aspirated]] (93&nbsp;hp) or [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] (142&nbsp;hp) form. The 100 [[horsepower|hp]] 2.5&nbsp;L K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2&nbsp;L Turbo I engine's horsepower was increased to {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}}. The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best#1984|10Best]] list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler [[electronic voice alert]] system through 1987. A performance oriented \"[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]\" version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987. For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a ''Shelby Z'' trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II ({{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \u2013 {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}) intercooled version of the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]], as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with [[Getrag]] gears. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name ''Chrysler GS Turbo II''. A more luxury-oriented ''Pacifica'' trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver's seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times).\n\n[[File:87-91 Dodge Daytona.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1987\u20131991 Dodge Daytona]]\n[[File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg|thumb|left|1987 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z]]\n\nDiplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver's side [[airbag]] as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler's lineup (they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag). Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver.\n\nThe Dodge Dynasty is related to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]; both car lines were built on the [[Chrysler C platform]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]]. It is also similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] and [[Chrysler Imperial]], which were available from 1990 to 1993 on an extended wheelbase platform of the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. The [[Lee Iacocca]]-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]. Dynasty trim levels included base and LE. Additionally, a \"Brougham\" package was offered on 1992\u201393 LE models that added a padded \"landau\" [[vinyl roof]]. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers. This greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car. All models (1988\u20131993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car's speed exceeded 15 miles per hour. \n\nThe 1989\u20131990 Ultradrive equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991\u20131993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the 4 cylinder & 3-speed TorqueFlite transmission. The 1988 3.0&nbsp;L V6 models with TorqueFlight transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. The new 3.3&nbsp;L V6 engine for 1990, with Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. A 2.5-litre [[inline-four engine|inline-4]] Chrysler engine (base model only), a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]], the 6G72 engine, and a [[Chrysler]]-built 3.3&nbsp;L V6 were available, although the 3.3&nbsp;L V6 was not available until 1990. The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0&nbsp;L in 1988. The new electronically controlled four-speed [[automatic transmission]], known as the Ultradrive or A604 ([[List of Chrysler transmissions]]), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. The vast majority of Dynastys sold to private customers had V6 engines; four-cylinder models mostly went to the fleet market.\n\nThrough the late 1980s and 1990s, Dodge's designation as the sporty-car division was backed by a succession of high-performance and/or aggressively styled models including the:\n*[[Dodge Daytona|Daytona]]\n*[[Dodge 600|600]] \n*Performance variants of the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]]\n*[[Dodge Viper|Viper]]\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:1991 Dodge Viper Indianapolis 500 Pace Car.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|The pre-production Dodge Viper (SR I) as the pace car for the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]].]]\n[[File:1990-92 Dodge Monaco.JPG|thumb|1990\u20131992 Dodge Monaco LE]]\n[[File:Spirit RT Front34.jpg|thumb|right|1991 [[Dodge Spirit#R/T|Dodge Spirit R/T]]]]\n[[File:Dodge Intrepid LB 1993-1997 19feb2007.jpg|thumb|Rear view]]\n[[File:1st Dodge Stratus.jpg|thumb|Cab Forward Design on a 1996 [[Dodge Stratus]]]]\n\nThe Omni and the Horizon ended production in 1990, and were replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/[[Plymouth Sundance]], which were both introduced for 1987. Both the Monaco and Premier were discontinued during the 1992 model year.

The Spirit sold well and had higher consumer acceptance than the [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]] that replaced it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Dodge-branded Mitsubishi vehicles were phased out by 1993 except for the Dodge Stealth running through 1996, though Mitsubishi-made engines and electrical components were still widely used in American domestic Chrysler products. \n\nIn 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as \"The New Dodge\", which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by [[Edward Herrmann]] that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also,he would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade.\n\nLater that year was the introduction of new [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]] sedan, totally different from its boxy [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] predecessor. The Intrepid used what Chrysler called \"[[cab forward]]\" styling, with the wheels pushed out to the corners of the chassis for maximum passenger space. The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch wheels with better tires, and stiffer \"touring\" suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5&nbsp;L SOHC engine rated at (214&nbsp;hp).\n\nIn 1994, the new second generation [[Dodge Ram]] pickup was introduced with bold styling that departed radically from the boxy designs of trucks made by the Big Three for two decades prior. The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the \"Louisville Slugger\" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref> The redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. \n\nThey followed up on this idea in a smaller scale with the [[Dodge Neon|Neon]] and [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]]. The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the [[Chrysler JA platform]] (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] ([[United States]] only). The Stratus, [[Plymouth Breeze]], and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] were all on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time.\n\nThe car was [[Badge engineering|badged and sold]] as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Mexico]] was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the '''Chrysler Neon'''. At the Neon's release, then president of [[Chrysler Corporation]] [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] said, \"There's an old saying in [[Detroit]]: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.'

Rationalizing Chrysler's broad lineup was a priority, and Dodge's sister brand Plymouth was withdrawn from the market. With this move, Dodge became DaimlerChrysler's low-price division as well as its performance division.\n\nThe Intrepid, Stratus, and Neon updates of the 1998 to 2000 timeframe were largely complete before Daimler's presence, and Dodge's first experience of any platform sharing with the German side of the company was the 2005 [[Dodge Magnum|Magnum]] [[station wagon]], introduced as a replacement for the Intrepid.

The rear-drive chassis was then used in early 2008 to build a new [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], with styling reminiscent of the original 1970 Challenger. Like its predecessor, the new Challenger coupe was available with a powerful V8 engine (base models featured a V6). In Spring 2007, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] reached an agreement with [[Cerberus Capital Management]] to sell its Chrysler Group subsidiary, of which the Dodge division was a part. Soon after, the housing bubble began to collapse the American market, and on May 1, 2009, Chrysler and GM filed for bankruptcy on the same day.\n\n===Fiat ownership===\nOn June 10, 2009, Italian automaker [[Fiat]] formed a partnership with Chrysler under [[Sergio Marchionne]], with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a \"bridge loan\" or \"bailout\". The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio's plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], in 2014.

This is a set up similar to [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]], which positions [[Peugeot]] as its mainstream brand while [[Citro\u00ebn]] is more performance-based, as well as [[Hyundai Motor Group]] having its two mainstream brands, [[Kia Motors]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company]] focusing on performance and mid-luxury, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (Among the American press, it has drawn comparisons to the decades-long set up of [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]] at [[General Motors]] before the phase-out of Pontiac in 2010.)

Although the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, Ram President Fred Diaz has said:\n\n<blockquote>Ram trucks will always and forever be Dodges. Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be ''<nowiki>'vinned'</nowiki>'' (from the acronym [[VIN]], or Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/01/ram-trucks-will-always-be-dodges-ram-president-says.html|title=Ram Trucks Will Always Be Dodges, Ram President Says - PickupTrucks.com News |website=news.pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pickups and medium to heavy trucks===\n[[File:1934 Dodge Brothers 2-ton stake truck red.jpg|thumb|right|1934 Dodge K-34 stake bed truck]]\nEver since Dodge began building their own cars in 1914, the company also offered light truck models. Initially, these were largely based on the existing passenger cars, but eventually gained their own chassis and body designs as the market matured. During the 1930s and 1940s, light- and medium-duty models were offered at first, then a heavy-duty range was added. The very large, new [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant was built in Michigan, just north of Detroit, and opened in 1938, producing Dodge trucks ever since.\n\nIn 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks were crucially redesigned\u2014not only receiving a new \"Fore-Point\" (similar to Cab Forward) design of the front side and cab\u2014but especially, the old car frames were dropped and for the first time replaced by modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails ''welded'' to the cross members.<ref name=AllparRam /> These welded frames were from here on introduced on half-ton to one-ton rated trucks, expanding Dodge into a heavier truck market segment than before.\n\nIn 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned [[Dodge T-, V-, W-Series|line of pickups and trucks]], with streamlined new, 'art-deco' front sheetmetal styling. Introducing the concept of \"Job-Rated\", Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit every job they were buying it for.<ref name=AllparRam>{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921-1953 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Allpar |access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> From the 1939 'Job-Rated' trucks onwards, Dodge's light and medium trucks were built in its 'Mound Road\" plant in Warren, Michigan.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] and the successful application of [[four-wheel drive]] to the truck line, Dodge introduced a civilian version that it called the [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagon]]. At first based almost exactly on the military-type design, variants of the standard truck line were eventually given 4WD and the same \"Power Wagon\" name.\n\nDodge was among the first to introduce car-like features to its trucks, adding the plush Adventurer package during the 1960s and offering sedan-like space in its Club Cab bodies of the 1970s. Declining sales and increased competition during the 1970s eventually forced the company to drop its medium- and heavy-duty models, an arena the company has only recently begun to reenter.\n\nDodge introduced what they called the \"Adult Toys\" line to boost its truck sales in the late 1970s, starting off with the limited edition Lil' Red Express pickup (featuring, a 360 c.i. police interceptor engine and visible [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]]-style [[exhaust system|exhaust]] stacks). Later came the more widely available [[Dodge Warlock|Warlock]]. Other \"Adult Toys\" from Dodge included the \"Macho Power Wagon\" and \"Street Van\".\n\nAs part of a general decline in the commercial vehicle field during the 1970s, Dodge eliminated their [[Dodge LCF Series|LCF Series]] heavy-duty trucks in 1975, along with the Bighorn and medium-duty D-Series trucks, and affiliated S Series [[school bus]]es were dropped in 1978. On the other hand, Dodge produced several thousand pickups for the [[United States armed forces|United States Military]] under the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle|CUCV]] program from the late 1970s into the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:89RamF34.jpg|thumb|1989 Dodge Ram pickup]]\nContinuing financial problems meant that even Dodge's light-duty models \u2013 renamed as the [[Dodge Ram|Ram Pickup]] line for 1981 \u2013 were carried over with the most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize Dodge's fortunes during this time. One was the introduction of [[Cummins]]' powerful and reliable [[Cummins B Series engine|B Series]] turbo-[[diesel engine]] as an option for 1989. This innovation raised Dodge's profile among consumers who needed power for towing or large loads. The second was a class-exclusive V8 engine option for the mid-sized [[Dodge Dakota|Dakota]] pickup.\n\nDodge introduced the Ram's all-new \"big-rig\" styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly [[Attitude polarization|polarizing]] looks, exposure was also gained by usage of the new truck on the hit TV show ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]]. The new Ram also featured a totally new interior with a console box big enough to hold a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins [[turbodiesel]] remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned for 1997 using the big rig styling, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive \"face\" that set them apart from the competition.\n\nThe Ram was redesigned again for 2002, and the Dakota in 2005, and was basically an evolution of the original, but adding the Hemi V8 engine to the list of available options, due to the revival of the legendary Chrysler Hemi V8 engine. New medium duty chassis cab models were introduced for 2007 with standard Cummins turbodiesel power as a way of gradually getting Dodge back into the business truck market again.\n\nFor a time during the 1980s, Dodge imported a line of small pickups from Mitsubishi, known as the D50, or later the [[Dodge Ram 50|Ram 50]] and were carried on as a stopgap until the Dakota's sales eventually made the imported trucks irrelevant. Reversing the role, Mitsubishi has more recently purchased Dakota pickups from Dodge and restyled them into their own [[Mitsubishi Raider|Raider]] line for sale in North America.\n\n===Vans===\nDodge had offered panel delivery models for many years since its founding, but their first purpose-built van model arrived for 1964 with the compact [[Dodge A100|A Series]]. Based on the Dodge Dart platform and using its proven six-cylinder or V8 engines, the A-series was a strong competitor for both its domestic rivals (from Ford and Chevrolet/[[GMC Truck|GMC]]) and the diminutive [[Volkswagen Transporter]] line.\n\nAs the market evolved, Dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future, and thus the [[Dodge B Series|B Series]] was introduced for 1971, and offered both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds. Like the trucks, Chrysler's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the [[Dodge Ram Van|Ram Van]] and [[Dodge Ram Wagon|Ram Wagon]] for 1981, this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003.\n[[File:2001-2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.jpg|thumb|right|2001\u20132004 [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]]]]\n\nThe DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998 made it possible for Dodge to explore new ideas; hence the European-styled [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] line of vans was brought over and given a Dodge styling treatment. Redesigned for 2006 as a 2007 model, the economical diesel-powered Sprinters have become very popular for city usage among delivery companies like [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in recent years. Because of their fuel efficiency major motorhome manufacturer Thor Motor Coach made several Class C and Class A [[Motorhomes]] available on the Dodge Sprinter Chassis including their popular Four Winds Siesta & Chateau Citation product lines.\n\nDodge also offered a cargo version of its best-selling Caravan for many years, at first calling it the Mini Ram Van, which was a name originally applied to the short-wheelbase B Series Ram Vans, and later naming it the Caravan C/V, the C/V stood for Cargo Van. For model year 2012, the Caravan C/V was rebranded as a Ram, and was renamed the Ram C/V.\n\n===Sport utility vehicles===\nDodge's first experiments with anything like a sport utility vehicle appeared in the late 1950s with a windowed version of their standard panel-truck \u2013 known as the [[Dodge Town Wagon|Town Wagon]]. These were built in the same style through the mid-1960s.\n\nBut the division did not enter the SUV arena in earnest until 1974, with the purpose-built [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ramcharger]]. Offering the then-popular open body style and Dodge's powerful V8 engines, the Ramcharger was a strong competitor for trucks like the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[International Harvester Scout]] II.\n\nOnce again, though, Dodge was left with outdated products during the 1980s as the market evolved. The Ramcharger hung on through 1993 with only minor updates. When the Ram truck was redesigned for the 1994 model year, the Ramcharger was discontinued in the American and Canadian markets. A version using the updated styling was made for the Mexican Market but was never imported to the U.S. or Canada.\n\nInstead, Dodge tried something new in 1997. Using the mid-sized Dakota pickup's chassis as a base, they built the four-door [[Dodge Durango|Durango]] SUV with seating for eight people and created a new niche. Sized between smaller SUVs (like the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]]) and larger models (like the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Ford Expedition]]), Durango was both a bit more and bit less{{original research inline|date=May 2012}} of everything. The redesigned version for 2004 grew a little bit in every dimension, becoming a full-size SUV (and thus somewhat less efficient), but was still sized between most of its competitors on either side of the aisle. For 2011 a new unibody Durango based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee was released. The 2011 Durango shrank slightly to size comparable to the original model.\n\nDodge also imported a version of Mitsubishi's popular Montero ([[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] in Japan) as the [[Dodge Raider|Raider]] from 1987 to 1989.\n\n=== High performance vehicles ===\nFrom the late 20th century onwards, Dodge's highest performing vehicles fell under the category [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]]. These models often came equipped with high performance V8s under the hood. These models included the [[Dodge Challenger]] SRT (2008\u2013current), [[Dodge Charger]] SRT (2006\u2013current), [[Dodge Magnum]] SRT (2006\u20132008) and [[Dodge Durango]] SRT (2018-current-). They also produced the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] (2003\u20132005), [[Dodge Caliber]] SRT-4 (2008\u20132009), [[Dodge Viper]] (1991\u20132010; 2012\u20132017), and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]] (2004\u20132006). In 2015, [[Chrysler|FCA]] introduced the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hellcat|Hellcat]], a 707 HP, [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L [[Hemispherical combustion chamber|HEMI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. In 2017, Dodge released the [[Dodge Challenger]] Demon. It is powered by an 840 HP [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L HEMI [[V8 engine|V8]], and comes from the factory with a toolbox known as the \"Demon Toolbox\" that has everything a buyer will need to drag race, including the skinny front drag tires. However, buyers will only get 840 HP on race fuel. On regular pump gas, it produces 808 HP, a 101 HP increase over the Hellcat.\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Dodge Polara (Argentina).jpg|thumb|right|An Argentine Dodge Polara, produced from 1968 to 1980]]\n\nDodge came to Argentina in the early 20th century with imported cars and trucks. In 1960, it partnered with Fevre-Basset as a local manufacturer. The first vehicle made in Argentina was the D-100 \"Sweptline\" pickup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |title=Dodge Sweptline |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=August 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821234742/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |archivedate=August 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Between 1961 and 1980, a variety of trucks were produced, including the D-400/DP-400,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-400.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D/DP-400 |work=camionargentino |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> D-500<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2016/02/dodge-d-500-4x4.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D-500 4x4|first=Matias|last=Lerch|date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>/DP-500,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-500.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D/DP-500 |work=camionargentino |date=March 22, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> DP600,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/06/dodge-dp-600.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DP-600 |work=camionargentino |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> DD900<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-dd-900.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DD-900 |work=camionargentino |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> and DD1000 (the last two with one curiosity: the air-cooled [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engine rather Perkins or Chrysler<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/08/dodge-dd-1000.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DD-1000 |work=camionargentino |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>). Passenger cars were also produced, namely the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant I and II]], and the local versions of the 1966 [[Dodge Dart]] (called Valiant III and IV). In 1971, the Dodge 1500, a rebadged [[Hillman Avenger]] from the United Kingdom was introduced. In 1982, production of Dodge vehicles ceased when German company [[Volkswagen]] bought the Fevre plant and the shares.\n\nIn Argentina, the name \"Polara\" was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the fourth generation North American [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]]. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980, by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.<ref name=\"Chrysler Argentina \">{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |title=Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115144202/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |date=May 18, 2009 |language=Spanish |archivedate=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Dodge began marketing cars and pick-ups directly in Argentina. Currently, both the Journey and the Ram are available to Argentine customers.\n\n===Asia===\nDodge entered the Japanese market in mid-2007, and re-entered the Chinese market in late 2007. [[Soueast Motors]] of China assembles the Caravan for the Chinese market. Dodge began marketing its vehicles in South Korea in 2004, starting with the Dakota.\n\n===Australia===\nDodge re-entered the Australian market in 2006 with the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]], their first offering since the AT4/D5N trucks in 1979 and the first Dodge passenger car to be marketed in Australia since the [[Dodge Phoenix|Phoenix]] sedan was discontinued in 1973. The second model to be introduced was the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]], with the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] and [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] followed. Dodge chose not use the full model lines and engines available to them, the 2.7&nbsp;L V6 being available in the Journey and Avenger instead of the 3.2&nbsp;L in the North American versions. However, diesel engines were introduced in all their cars.\nFollowing the Global Financial Crisis, Chrysler introduced the facelifted model of the Caliber and discontinued the Avenger imports. From early 2012 on, model year 2010 cars were available. By early 2012 no new cars were being brought into Australia aside from the new facelifted 2012 Journey.\n\nThere were rumors that Dodge cars will be re-badged as Fiats in the Australian market as was the case in Europe. The Dodge nameplate continued due to consistent sales of the Journey.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bruce |last=Newton |url= http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2012/fiat-punto-heading-back-to-australia-32839 |title=Fiat Punto heading back to Australia |publisher=carpoint.com.au |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> However, the brand was discontinued in the Australian market after 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Maclean |first=Andrew |title=Dodge brand dropped from Australia - Dodge disappears from Australia |url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/dodge-brand-dropped-from-australia-20161014-gs2od1 |website=Drive |accessdate=6 December 2019 |language=en-au |date=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nIn Brazil, Dodge cars were produced between 1969 and 1981 with the models Dart, Charger, Magnum, LeBaron (all powered by the same 318&nbsp;cid V8 engine), and the compact 1800/Polara, based on the British [[Hillman Avenger]]. The manufacturer was acquired by Volkswagen in 1981. In 1998, the Dakota pickup started production in a new plant in [[Campo Largo, Paran\u00e1]] by [[Mercedes-Benz]], which belongs to its former partner [[Daimler AG]]. It was built there until 2001 with petrol and diesel engines and regular, extended and crew cabs. In 2010, Dodge started sales of the imported pickup Ram 2500. The model portfolio is being expanded, starting with the Journey crossover for the 2009 model year.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, the Dodge lineup of cars started down the road to elimination along with the Plymouth line when in 1988 the [[Dodge Dynasty]] was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty and sold at both Plymouth and Dodge dealers. Similarly, the new [[Dodge Intrepid]], the Dynasty's replacement, was sold as the Chrysler Intrepid.\n\nFor 2000, the new Neon became the Chrysler Neon. The Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped. Dodge trucks, which have been sold at Canadian Plymouth dealers since 1973, continued without change. All Plymouth-Chrysler and Dodge-Chrysler dealers became Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealers.\n\nThe diluting of the Chrysler name did not go well in Canada, especially as the nameplate had been pushed as a luxury line since the 1930s. For 2003, the revamped Neon appeared in Canada as the Dodge SX 2.0. Since then, all new Dodge models have been sold in Canada under the Dodge name.\n\n===Europe===\nDodge started assembling lorries (trucks) in the United Kingdom from imported parts in 1922. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis at its works in [[Kew]], using American engines and gearboxes.<ref>{{cite web|author=doctor colin |url= http://www.dodge50.co.uk/dodgehistory.htm |title=1922 To 1983 a brief history of Dodge in the U.K. |publisher=Dodge50.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Right-hand drive Dodge trucks\n{{gallery | height = 120\n|File:Dodge D 15.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:Preserved dodge, Limestone Museum, Malta Siggiewa. feb 2011 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:1952 Dodge Kew \"Parrot Nose\" truck in red.jpg|1952 Kew-built Dodge D100\n}}\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Dodge Kew was part of the [[London Aircraft Production Group]], building fuselage sections for [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers. The pre-war and wartime truck range was replaced by the [[Dodge 100 \"Kew\"]] truck (1949\u20131957), nicknamed the \"parrot nose\" due to the sculpted lines of its bonnet.  Subsequent normal-control Dodges built at Kew were the 200 series (1957\u20131963) and the 400 series (1963\u20131965). The 400 series was a version of the American [[Dodge D series|D series]] medium-duty models. Also built at Kew were the [[Cab over|cab-over]] [[Dodge 300|300 series]] (1957\u20131965) and its successor the [[Dodge 500|500 series/K-series]] (1964\u20131978) tilt-cab. In 1964 Chrysler acquired its first stake in the British [[Rootes Group]] and it was decided to consolidate all truck production at Rootes' factory in Dunstable.  British assembly of the 400 series was discontinued due to declining sales of normal-control trucks, and production of the 500 series was transferred to Dunstable in 1967.  \n\nIn some export markets British-built Dodge trucks used the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] or [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] marques, and the situation was further complicated after takeover of the Rootes Group whose commercial vehicles were sold under the [[Commer]] and [[Karrier]] marques. Some Dodge 500s were given Commer badges, whilst the [[Dodge 100 \"Commando\"|100 series \"Commando\"]] light truck (1970\u20131989) developed by Rootes was initially marketed under all five marques. In the UK market Commers were usually lighter than Dodges, whereas the Karrier marque tended to be used on vehicles sold to public sector operators such as local authorities. Some of the smaller Commer/Karrier vans were also sold as Fargos in export markets.  In 1976 Chrysler Europe  rationalised its marques and thereafter all the British-built commercial vehicles were sold as Dodges or (increasingly rarely) Karriers. This included the smaller [[Commer FC|Commer SpaceVan]] (1960\u20131983) and [[Commer Walk-Thru]] (1961\u20131979), which became Dodges for their final years. The van and pick-up versions of Chrysler Europe's French-built [[Simca 1100]] were also branded as Dodges in Britain from 1976, although they remained Simcas elsewhere (and became Talbots in Britain after 1979).\n\nAmerican Chrysler Corporation cars, including some Dodge models, were assembled from [[Knock-down kit|CKD]] kits at various locations in Europe until the 1970s, including Kew (1920s-30s), Antwerp (1926\u20131958) and Rotterdam (1958\u20131970), but sales volumes were low as even 'compact' American cars like the [[Dodge Dart]] were enormous [[Gas-guzzler|gas-guzzlers]] by European standards. However, [[protectionist]] policies in some countries encouraged small local manufacturers to license-build CKD models, including [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren|AMAG]] in Switzerland (building Chryslers and Dodges 1948\u20131972) and [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] in Spain (building Dodge Darts from 1965 as the Barreiros Dart). By 1969 Chrysler had acquired full control of Barreiros, and Darts were being exported to other European countries under the Dodge name (precipitating closure of the Rotterdam plant). From 1970 the Spanish-built Dart was replaced by the Barreiros/Dodge 3700 which remained in production until 1977. The Dodge cars were a relatively small part of the Madrid factory's output, which was dominated by smaller Simca-designed cars and Barreiros-designed heavy duty trucks. From 1972 such trucks were sold as the [[Dodge 300]] (though unrelated to the earlier British 300 series), which was available as 4\u00d72, 6\u00d74, 8\u00d72 and 8\u00d74 rigids, as well as 4\u00d72 semi-trailer tractors.\n\nFollowing Chrysler Europe's collapse in 1977 and the sale of their assets to [[Peugeot]], the van and truck range and the associated factories in Dunstable and Madrid were quickly passed on to [[Renault Trucks|Renault V\u00e9hicules Industriels]]. Chrysler licensed the Dodge name to be used on Renault trucks sold in certain European markets \u2013 most notably the United Kingdom. However the only subsequent new model to carry the Dodge name was the [[Dodge 50 series]] (1979\u20131992), which replaced the earlier Walk-Thru and was widely used in Britain by utility companies, the military and as a minibus, but was rarely seen outside the UK. Thereafter all new models were Renaults, and in 1987 the Dodge name was dropped from the remaining inherited models (50 and Commando), which became Renaults for their last few years of production.\n\nDodge vehicles would not return to Europe until the introduction of the Neon, badged as a Chrysler, in the mid-1990s.\n\nChrysler reintroduced the Dodge marque to Europe on a broad scale in 2006, with a lineup consisting of North American-built Caliber, Avenger, Viper SRT-10, Nitro and [[Dodge Journey]] cars and SUVs, but this proved to be a shortlived return due to the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and the takeover of Chrysler by Fiat. In 2010 the Dodge marque was pulled from the UK due to poor sales<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/05/19/dodge-stops-selling-nitro-caliber-in-uk/ |title=Dodge stops selling Nitro, Caliber in UK |publisher=Autoblog |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> and on June 1, 2011 it was dropped from the rest of Europe. All of the Dodge models were discontinued in Europe except the Dodge Journey, which became the [[Fiat Freemont]] (and which was not available in the right-hand-drive Ireland or UK markets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofacil.es/problemas-coche/2011/07/11/pasa-tienes-chrysler-o-dodge/7432.html |title=Qu\u00e9 pasa si tienes un Chrysler o Dodge|publisher=Autof\u00e1cil (Luike) |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, the [[Hyundai Accent]], [[Hyundai Atos]], and [[Hyundai Porter|Hyundai H100]] were branded as \"Dodge\", [[Dodge Attitude]], \"Verna by Dodge\", \"Atos by Dodge\" and \"Dodge H100\" respectively, and sold at Chrysler/Dodge dealers. Current models are marketed with Hyundai logos instead of the \"Ram\" logo on previous model years since 2014. Dodge and Hyundai ended the venture and Dodge will use rebadged and reworked Fiats (2014). Also, to the next year with [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] is sold as the new Dodge Attitude since 2015.\n\n==Logos==\n* Star: The original Dodge was a circle, with two Greek [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] intertwined representing the letter \"[[D]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/world/canada/3-dodge.html |title=History of Dodge Brothers |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref> forming a six-pointed star in the middle; an interlocked \"DB\" was at the center of the star, and the words \"Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicles\" encircled the outside edge. Although similar to the [[Star of David]], the Dodge brothers were not [[Jewish]]; they were [[Methodist]]s. Although the \"Brothers\" was dropped from the name for trucks in 1929 and cars in 1930, the DB star remained in the cars until the 1939 models were introduced.\n* Ram: For 1932 Dodge cars adopted a leaping ram as the car's hood ornament. Starting with the 1940 models the leaping ram became more streamlined and by 1951 only the head, complete with curving horns, remained. The 1954 model cars were the last to use the ram's head before the reintroduction in the 1980s. Dodge trucks adopted the ram as the hood ornament for the 1940 model year with the 1950 models as the last.\n* Crest: For 1941 Dodge introduced a crest, supposedly the Dodge family crest. The design had four horizontal bars broken in the middle by one vertical bar with an \"O\" in the center. A knight's head appeared at the top of the emblem. Although the head would be dropped for 1955, the emblem would survive through 1957 and reappear on the 1976 Aspen. The crest would be used through to 1981 on its second time around, being replaced by the Pentastar for 1982. The knight's head without the crest would be used for 1959.\n* Forward Look: Virgil Exner's radical Forward Look redesign of Chrysler's vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by the adoption of a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting [[space age]] rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, and accessories through September 1962.\n* Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a fractured [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo first appeared on the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers came up with the meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1962-1964-dodge-8802.htm |title=1962\u20131964 Dodge 880 article |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sealey |first=Mike |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/logos.html |title=Mike Sealey's history of Chrysler's logos |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as steering wheel center hubs and road wheel covers.\n* Pentastar: From 1982 to 1995, Dodge used Chrysler's [[Pentastar]] logo on its cars and trucks to replace the Dodge crest, although it had been used for corporate recognition since late 1962. In advertisements and on dealer signage, Dodge's Pentastar was red, while Chrysler-Plymouth's was blue.\n* [[Ram Trucks|Ram]]'s head: Dodge reintroduced the ram's head hood ornament on the new 1973 Dodge Bighorn heavy duty tractor units. Gradually the ram's head began appearing on the pickup trucks as Dodge began to refer to their trucks as Ram. The present iteration of the [[Bighorn sheep|Ram]]'s-head logo appeared in late 1992 on the 1993 Intrepid, standardizing on that logo in 1996 for all vehicles except the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which uses the [[Viperidae|Viper's]] Head.\n* New logo: In 2010, with the separation of the Ram brand, two new Dodge logos were unveiled. The first logo features the word \"DODGE\" with two red inclined stripes. It was originally used strictly for marketing purposes, however Dodge introduced the logo onto the grilles of the 2012 lineup.\n\nA second emblem was revealed during the unveiling of the 2011 Durango, which used the same five-point shield-shaped outline of the old emblem, but with the ram's head replaced with a chrome cross reminiscent of the brand's signature cross-haired grille.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/|title=New Dodge emblem revealed |publisher=VehiCast |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112925/http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/ |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> This was only used on the [[steering wheel]].
