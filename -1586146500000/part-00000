Baldwin Spencer''' or '''Baldwin Spencer''', was an English-Australian [[Biology|biologist]] and [[anthropology|anthropologist]]. He is particularly known for his work in the field in [[Central Australia]] with [[Frank Gillen]], with many achievements being noted as the work of \"'''Spencer and Gillen'''\".\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBaldwin was born in [[Stretford]], Lancashire. His father, Reuben Spencer, who had come from [[Derbyshire]] in his youth, obtained a position with Rylands and Sons, cotton manufacturers, and rose to be chairman of its board of directors when Rylands became a company. Baldwin was educated at [[Old Trafford, Manchester|Old Trafford]] school, and on leaving entered the Manchester School of Art. He stayed only one year but never forgot his training in drawing. After leaving the school of arts Spencer went to Owens College where Milnes Marshall guided him in his study of biology. He gained a scholarship at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. Before going to Oxford he won the [[John Dalton|Dalton Prize]] for natural history.\n\nSpencer began his studies at Oxford in 1881. In June 1884 he qualified for his [[BA degree]], obtaining first-class honours in [[biology]]. In 1885 he became assistant to [[Henry Nottidge Moseley|Professor Moseley]] and shortly afterwards had valuable experience helping him and Professor Tylor to remove the Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers collection from [[South Kensington]] to Oxford. This helped to develop his interest in anthropology and museum work. In January 1886 he obtained a fellowship at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]].\n\n===Move to Melbourne===\n\nHaving already contributed various papers to scientific journals, one of which, on the [[Parietal eye|Pineal eye]] in lizards, had aroused much interest, and having applied for the professorship of biology at [[The University of Melbourne|Melbourne]] in June 1886 was elected to that chair in January 1887.\n\nA few days later he was married to Mary Elizabeth Bowman and left for Australia where he arrived in March. He immediately set about organising his new school (the chair had just been founded) and succeeded in getting a grant of \u00a38000 to begin building his lecture rooms and laboratories. He showed much capability as a lecturer and organiser, and also took a full part in the general activities of the university. His interests were not confined to his university duties; he took a leading part in the proceedings of the [[Royal Society of Victoria]], the [[Field Naturalists Club of Victoria]], and the [[Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science|Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]], and did valuable work for those bodies.\n\n===Exploration and museum work===\nIn 1894 a new field was opened up for Spencer when he joined the [[Horn Expedition|W.A. Horn scientific expedition]] which left [[Adelaide]] in May 1894 to explore Australia. In July he met [[Francis James Gillen]] at [[Alice Springs]] with whom he was to be so much associated in the study of the [[Indigenous Australian|Aborigines]]. The expedition covered some 2000 miles in about three months and on his return Spencer busied himself with editing the report, to which he also largely contributed. It was published in 1896. In November 1896 Spencer was again at Alice Springs beginning the work with Gillen which resulted in ''Native Tribes of Central Australia'', published in 1899 and partly opposed by [[Carl Strehlow]] and [[Moritz von Leonhardi]]. He continued this work with Gillen during the vacations of the two following years. A large amount of material relating to tribal customs was accumulated, and the book appeared with the names of both Gillen and Spencer on the title page.\n\nSpencer was recruited as science writer for the ''[[Australasian Post|Australasian]]'' by its editor, [[David Watterston]].<ref>\n{{Australian Dictionary of Biography\n |first=John |last=Hurst\n |title=Watterston, David (1845\u20131931)\n |id2=watterston-david-9013\n |accessdate=25 October 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nSpencer had been appointed a trustee of the public library in 1895. When Sir [[Frederick McCoy]] died in May 1899 he became honorary director of the national museum.

He was President of the Melbourne University Sports Union and later was the President of the [[VFL/AFL|Victorian Football League]] from 1919 to 1925.<ref name=\"Ross\" >{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=John|title=100 Years of Australian Football|date=1996|publisher=Viking Books|location=Ringwood, Australia|isbn=9781854714343|pages=382}}</ref>\nIn 1911 at the request of the Commonwealth government he led an expedition in the [[Northern Territory]] sent to make inquiries into conditions there, and in the following year he published his ''Across Australia'' and also accepted the position of special commissioner and chief [[Protector of Aborigines]]. The story of this will be found in ''Native Tribes of the Northern Territory of Australia'' (1914).\n[[File:Baldwin Spencer Building 1.jpg|thumb|The Baldwin Spencer Building at the University of Melbourne]]\nIn 1914 Spencer was honorary secretary for the meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] held in Melbourne. He also did work for the national museum. In 1916 at the request of the [[Alfred Felton|Felton Bequest]]'s committee he went to England to obtain an art adviser for the Felton Bequest. He took an interest in Australian artists. He had been made CMG in 1904 and in 1916 he was created a KCMG in 1919 he resigned his professorship and in 1920 became vice-president of the trustees of the public library of Victoria.

These visits enabled Spencer to revise his earlier researches and consider on the spot various opposing theories that had been brought forward. His ''The Arunta: a Study of a Stone Age People'' (1927), revisits and reaffirms his earlier conclusions; Gillen's name as joint author appeared on the title-page though he had died 15 years before. ''Wanderings in Wild Australia'', published a year later and slightly more popular in form, completes the list of his books. A list of his other published writings will be found in ''Spencer's Last Journey'' (1931). Spencer went to London in 1927 to see these books through the press. Ten years before he had said that he realised he was not getting younger and must regard his field work as finished. In February 1929, however, in his sixty-ninth year, he travelled in a cargo boat to [[Magallanes y la Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena Region|Magallanes]] and then went in a little schooner to Ushuaia at the south of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\n===Death===\nIn June 1929 he went to [[Hoste Island]] seeking an old [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] woman who was reputed to know a little English. There he became ill and died of heart failure on 14 July 1929. Lady Spencer and two daughters survived him.\n\n===Recognition and legacy===\n\n[[John Mulvaney]], considered the \"father of Australian [[archaeology]]\", described ''The Native Tribes of Central Australia'' (by Spencer and Gillen, with input from collaborators [[Patrick Michael Byrne (Australian anthropologist)|Paddy Byrne]], [[telegraphist]] at Charlotte Waters, and Ernest Cowle, police officer at [[Illamurta Springs Conservation Reserve|Illumurta Springs]]) as one of Australia's most influential books in the history of ideas\".<ref name=Ockhams>{{cite web|website=ABC Radio|publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/from-the-frontier/3483466#transcript|title=From the frontier: Professor John Mulvaney talks about his book: \"From The Frontier - Outback Letters to Baldwin Spencer\" (transcript)|series=Ockham's Razor|first=Robyn|last=Williams|date=3 December 2000|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Australian Research Council]] project is currently under way to aggregate and digitise the original Spencer and Gillen collection.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1976 Spencer was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by [[Australia Post]].\n\nThe [[Baldwin Spencer Building]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] is architecturally and historically significant to the State of Victoria and currently occupied by the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSpencer is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of Australian lizards: ''[[Pseudemoia|Pseudemoia spenceri]]'' and ''[[Varanus spenceri]]''.<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Baldwin Spencer''' or '''Baldwin Spencer''', was an English-Australian [[Biology|biologist]] and [[anthropology|anthropologist]]. He is particularly known for his work in the field in [[Central Australia]] with [[Frank Gillen]], with many achievements being noted as the work of \"'''Spencer and Gillen'''\".\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBaldwin was born in [[Stretford]], Lancashire. His father, Reuben Spencer, who had come from [[Derbyshire]] in his youth, obtained a position with Rylands and Sons, cotton manufacturers, and rose to be chairman of its board of directors when Rylands became a company. Baldwin was educated at [[Old Trafford, Manchester|Old Trafford]] school, and on leaving entered the Manchester School of Art. He stayed only one year but never forgot his training in drawing. After leaving the school of arts Spencer went to Owens College where Milnes Marshall guided him in his study of biology. He gained a scholarship at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. Before going to Oxford he won the [[John Dalton|Dalton Prize]] for natural history.\n\nSpencer began his studies at Oxford in 1881. In June 1884 he qualified for his [[BA degree]], obtaining first-class honours in [[biology]]. In 1885 he became assistant to [[Henry Nottidge Moseley|Professor Moseley]] and shortly afterwards had valuable experience helping him and Professor Tylor to remove the Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers collection from [[South Kensington]] to Oxford. This helped to develop his interest in anthropology and museum work. In January 1886 he obtained a fellowship at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]].\n\n===Move to Melbourne===\n\nHaving already contributed various papers to scientific journals, one of which, on the [[Parietal eye|Pineal eye]] in lizards, had aroused much interest, and having applied for the professorship of biology at [[The University of Melbourne|Melbourne]] in June 1886 was elected to that chair in January 1887.\n\nA few days later he was married to Mary Elizabeth Bowman and left for Australia where he arrived in March. He immediately set about organising his new school (the chair had just been founded) and succeeded in getting a grant of \u00a38000 to begin building his lecture rooms and laboratories. He showed much capability as a lecturer and organiser, and also took a full part in the general activities of the university. His interests were not confined to his university duties; he took a leading part in the proceedings of the [[Royal Society of Victoria]], the [[Field Naturalists Club of Victoria]], and the [[Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science|Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]], and did valuable work for those bodies.\n\n===Exploration and museum work===\nIn 1894 a new field was opened up for Spencer when he joined the [[Horn Expedition|W.A. Horn scientific expedition]] which left [[Adelaide]] in May 1894 to explore Australia. In July he met [[Francis James Gillen]] at [[Alice Springs]] with whom he was to be so much associated in the study of the [[Indigenous Australian|Aborigines]]. The expedition covered some 2000 miles in about three months and on his return Spencer busied himself with editing the report, to which he also largely contributed. It was published in 1896. In November 1896 Spencer was again at Alice Springs beginning the work with Gillen which resulted in ''Native Tribes of Central Australia'', published in 1899 and partly opposed by [[Carl Strehlow]] and [[Moritz von Leonhardi]]. He continued this work with Gillen during the vacations of the two following years. A large amount of material relating to tribal customs was accumulated, and the book appeared with the names of both Gillen and Spencer on the title page.\n\nSpencer was recruited as science writer for the ''[[Australasian Post|Australasian]]'' by its editor, [[David Watterston]].<ref>\n{{Australian Dictionary of Biography\n |first=John |last=Hurst\n |title=Watterston, David (1845\u20131931)\n |id2=watterston-david-9013\n |accessdate=25 October 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nSpencer had been appointed a trustee of the public library in 1895. When Sir [[Frederick McCoy]] died in May 1899 he became honorary director of the national museum. He was to do an enormous amount of work in the following years, and to present to the museum many valuable collections of sacred and ceremonial Aboriginal objects collected during his journeys. He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], London.\n\nIn 1900 and in 1901 he spent 12 months in the field with Gillen going from [[Oodnadatta]] to Powell Creek and then eastward to Borraloola on the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].  They were assisted with their work by the artist and [[anthropological linguistics|interpreter]] known to Europeans as Jim Kite, [[Erlikilyika]], who lived at [[Charlotte Waters, Northern Territory|Charlotte Waters telegraph station]], where Gillen had previously spent some years.<ref name=diary11-26>{{cite document|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320741186|title=Walter Baldwin Spencer's Diary from the Spencer and Gillen Expedition, 1901-1902|others=Edited and annotated by Jason Gibson; transcribed by Heather Milton|first=Walter|last=Baldwin Spencer|date=1901-1902|publisher=Museums Victoria|editor-first=Jason|editor-last=Gibson|page=11, footnote 26}}</ref> Their experiences and studies formed the basis of the next book, ''The Northern Tribes of Central Australia'', which appeared in 1904, dedicated to David Syme, who had given \u00a31000 towards the cost of the expedition.

He also did work for the national museum. In 1916 at the request of the [[Alfred Felton|Felton Bequest]]'s committee he went to England to obtain an art adviser for the Felton Bequest. He took an interest in Australian artists. He had been made CMG in 1904 and in 1916 he was created a KCMG in 1919 he resigned his professorship and in 1920 became vice-president of the trustees of the public library of Victoria.

These visits enabled Spencer to revise his earlier researches and consider on the spot various opposing theories that had been brought forward. His ''The Arunta: a Study of a Stone Age People'' (1927), revisits and reaffirms his earlier conclusions; Gillen's name as joint author appeared on the title-page though he had died 15 years before. ''Wanderings in Wild Australia'', published a year later and slightly more popular in form, completes the list of his books. A list of his other published writings will be found in ''Spencer's Last Journey'' (1931). Spencer went to London in 1927 to see these books through the press. Ten years before he had said that he realised he was not getting younger and must regard his field work as finished. In February 1929, however, in his sixty-ninth year, he travelled in a cargo boat to [[Magallanes y la Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena Region|Magallanes]] and then went in a little schooner to Ushuaia at the south of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\n===Death===\nIn June 1929 he went to [[Hoste Island]] seeking an old [[Yaghan language|Yaghan]] woman who was reputed to know a little English. There he became ill and died of heart failure on 14 July 1929. Lady Spencer and two daughters survived him.\n\n===Recognition and legacy===\n\n[[John Mulvaney]], considered the \"father of Australian [[archaeology]]\", described ''The Native Tribes of Central Australia'' (by Spencer and Gillen, with input from collaborators [[Patrick Michael Byrne (Australian anthropologist)|Paddy Byrne]], [[telegraphist]] at Charlotte Waters, and Ernest Cowle, police officer at [[Illamurta Springs Conservation Reserve|Illumurta Springs]]) as one of Australia's most influential books in the history of ideas\".<ref name=Ockhams>{{cite web|website=ABC Radio|publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/ockhamsrazor/from-the-frontier/3483466#transcript|title=From the frontier: Professor John Mulvaney talks about his book: \"From The Frontier - Outback Letters to Baldwin Spencer\" (transcript)|series=Ockham's Razor|first=Robyn|last=Williams|date=3 December 2000|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n{{External media|image1=[http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0011870.jpg Baldwin stamp]}}\n\nAn [[Australian Research Council]] project is currently under way to aggregate and digitise the original Spencer and Gillen collection.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1976 Spencer was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by [[Australia Post]].\n\nThe [[Baldwin Spencer Building]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] is architecturally and historically significant to the State of Victoria and currently occupied by the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSpencer is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of Australian lizards: ''[[Pseudemoia|Pseudemoia spenceri]]'' and ''[[Varanus spenceri]]''.<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Among [[Neontology|extant]] land animals in North America and Siberia, the bison is the heaviest and the longest, and the second tallest after the [[moose]].\n\nSpanning back many centuries, [[Plains Indians|Native American tribes]] have had cultural and spiritual connections to the American bison.

However, the name ''buffalo'' is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. [[Samuel de Champlain]] applied the term buffalo (''buffles'' in French) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the [[Nipissing First Nation]], who said they travelled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals.<ref>Champlain, Samuel, Henry P. Biggar. 1929. The Works of Samuel de Champlain, vol 3. Toronto: Champlain Society. p. 105.</ref> In English usage, the term ''buffalo'' dates to 1625 in North America, when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.<ref>''[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=buffalo#B5544800 The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]'', Fifth Edition:</ref>  It thus has a much longer history than the term ''bison'', which was first recorded in 1774.<ref>http://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Buffalo-facts.html</ref> The American bison is very closely related to the [[European bison]] (also known as wisent or the European wood bison).\n\nIn [[Plains Indian]] languages in general, male and female buffaloes are distinguished, with each having a different designation rather than there being a single generic word covering both sexes. Thus:\n* in [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]]: {{lang|arp|bii}} (buffalo cow), {{lang|arp|hen\u00e9\u00e9cee}} (buffalo bull)\n* in [[Lakota language|Lakota]]: {{lang|lkt|pt\u00e9}} (buffalo cow), {{lang|lkt|t\u021fat\u021f\u00e1\u014bka}} (buffalo bull)\nSuch a distinction is not a general feature of the language (for example, Arapaho possesses gender-neutral terms for other large mammals such as elk, mule deer, etc.), and so presumably is due to the special significance of the buffalo in Plains Indian life and culture.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Bison bison Wichita Mountain Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|Male plains bison in the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]]]]\n[[File:Bison skeleton at MAV-USP.jpg|thumb|Skeleton]]\n[[File:Muybridge Buffalo galloping.gif|thumb|American bison galloping, photos by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], first published in 1887 in ''Animal Locomotion'']]\nA bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat.

This cross breeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as [[yak]] being related to American bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent.\n\nA 2003 study of mitochondrial DNA indicated four distinct maternal lineages in [[tribe (biology)|subtribe]] [[Bovina (subtribe)|Bovina]]:\n\n# Taurine [[cattle]] and [[zebu]]\n# [[European bison]] (wisent)\n# American bison and yak<ref name=Guo2006>{{cite journal|year=2006 |title=Taxonomic placement and origin of yaks: implications from analyses of mtDNA D-loop fragment sequences |journal=Acta Theriologica Sinica |volume=26 |issue=4 |url=http://english.mammal.cn/Magazine/show.aspx?id=2079 |pages=325\u2013330 |author=Guo, S. |displayauthors=etal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308221242/http://english.mammal.cn/Magazine/show.aspx?id=2079 |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}</ref> \n# [[Banteng]], [[gaur]], and [[gayal]]\n\nHowever, [[Y chromosome]] analysis associated wisent and American bison.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=14739241|title=Maternal and Paternal Lineages in Cross-Breeding Bovine Species.

Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison.  Bison also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep.  Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the [[Yellowstone Park bison herd]] are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the [[Henry Mountains bison herd]] is found on the plains around the [[Henry Mountains]], Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet.\nThe first thoroughfares of North America, except for the time-obliterated paths of [[mastodon]] or [[muskox]] and the routes of the [[Mound builder (people)|mound builders]], were the traces made by bison and [[deer]] in seasonal migration and between feeding grounds and [[salt lick]]s. Many of these routes, hammered by countless hoofs instinctively following watersheds and the crests of ridges in avoidance of lower places' summer muck and winter snowdrifts, were followed by the aboriginal North Americans as courses to hunting grounds and as warriors' paths. They were invaluable to explorers and were adopted by [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|pioneers]].\n\nBison traces were characteristically north and south, but several key east-west trails were used later as railways. Some of these include the [[Cumberland Gap]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] to upper [[Kentucky]]. A heavily used [[Buffalo Trace (road)|trace]] crossed the [[Ohio River]] at the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area|Falls of the Ohio]] and ran west, crossing the [[Wabash River]] near [[Vincennes, Indiana]].

Hornaday Extermination of the American Bison 1889 Cornell CUL PJM 1102 01.jpg|thumb|Map from 1889 by William T. Hornaday, illustrating the Extermination of the American Bison|left]]\nA major problem that bison face today is a lack of [[genetic diversity]] due to the [[population bottleneck]] the species experienced during its near-extinction event. Another genetic issue is the entry of genes from [[domestic cattle]] into the bison population, through hybridization.<ref name=nwfj/>\n\nOfficially, the \"American buffalo\" is classified by the United States government as a type of cattle, and the government allows private herds to be managed as such. This is a reflection of the characteristics that bison share with cattle.  Though the American bison is not only a separate species, but also is usually regarded as being in a separate genus from [[domestic cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), they clearly have a lot of genetic compatibility and American bison can interbreed with cattle, although only the female offspring are fertile in the first generation. These female hybrids can be bred back to either bison or domestic bulls, resulting in either 1/4 or 3/4 bison young. Female offspring from this cross are also fertile, but males are not reliably fertile unless they are either {{frac|7|8}} bison or {{frac|7|8}} domestic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Liberty Hyde Bailey|title=Cyclopedia of American Agriculture, Volume III: Animals|year=1908|publisher=The MacMillan Company|page=291}}</ref> Moreover, when they do interbreed, crossbreed animals in the first generation tend to look very much like purebred bison, so appearance is completely unreliable as a means of determining what is a purebred bison and what is a crossbred cow.  Many ranchers have deliberately crossbred their cattle with bison, and some natural hybridization could be expected in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for crossbreeding may sometimes have been common.\n\nIn recent decades, tests were developed to determine the source of mitochondrial DNA in cattle and bison, and most private \"buffalo\" herds were actually crossbred with cattle, and even most state and federal buffalo herds had some cattle DNA. With the advent of nuclear microsatellite DNA testing, the number of herds known to contain cattle genes has increased. Though about 500,000 bison exist on private ranches and in public herds, perhaps only 15,000 to 25,000 of these bison are pure and not actually bison-cattle hybrids. \"DNA from domestic cattle (''Bos taurus'') has been detected in nearly all bison herds examined to date.\"<ref>[http://snr.unl.edu/gpcesu/PDFs/WICA%20Bison.pdf Remove Threats to Irreplaceable Bison Herd at Wind Cave National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723115242/http://snr.unl.edu/gpcesu/PDFs/WICA%20Bison.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}.

One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.\n\n[[File:Bis\u00f3 de bosc.jpg|thumb|A [[wood bison]] around [[Coal River (Canada)|Coal River]] in Canada]]\nIn the study, cattle genes were also found in small amounts throughout most national, state and private herds. \"The hybridization experiments conducted by some of the owners of the five foundation herds of the late 1800s, have left a legacy of a small amount of cattle genetics in many of our existing bison herds.\" He also said, \"All of the state owned bison herds tested (except for possibly one) contain animals with domestic cattle mtDNA.\"<ref name=\"buffalofieldcampaign.org\"/>  It appears that the one state herd that had no cattle genes was the Henry Mountains bison herd; the Henry Mountain herd was started initially with transplanted animals from Yellowstone Park. However, the extension of this herd into the [[Book Cliffs]] of central Utah involved mixing the founders with additional bison from another source, so it is not known if the Book Cliffs extension of the herd is also free of cattle hybridization.\n\nA separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in ''Genome'', was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies. The Wood Buffalo Park bison were determined to actually be crossbreeds between plains and wood bison, but their predominant genetic makeup was that of the expected \"wood buffalo\".<ref name=\"PMID10382295\" />  However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd was pure plains bison, and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. Another finding was that the bison in the Antelope Island herd in Utah appeared to be more distantly related to other plains bison in general than any other plains bison group that was tested, though this might be due to [[genetic drift]] caused by the small size of only 12 individuals in the founder population.

In Canada, the bison is the official animal of the province of [[Manitoba]] and appears on the Manitoba flag. It is also used in the official coat of arms of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].\n\nSeveral American coins feature the bison, most famously on the reverse side of the \"[[Indian Head nickel|buffalo nickel]]\" from 1913 to 1938. In 2005, the [[United States Mint]] coined a nickel with a new depiction of the bison as part of its [[Westward Journey Nickel Series|\"Westward Journey\"]] series. The Kansas and North Dakota state quarters, part of the \"[[50 State Quarters|50 State Quarter]]\" series, each feature bison. The Kansas state quarter has only the bison and does not feature any writing, while the North Dakota state quarter has two bison. The Montana state quarter prominently features a bison skull over a landscape. The Yellowstone National Park quarter also features a bison standing next to a geyser.\n\nOther institutions which have adopted the bison as a symbol or mascot include:<!-- Hundreds if not thousands of institutions use the bison as a symbol.

However, the name ''buffalo'' is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. [[Samuel de Champlain]] applied the term buffalo (''buffles'' in French) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the [[Nipissing First Nation]], who said they travelled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals.<ref>Champlain, Samuel, Henry P. Biggar. 1929. The Works of Samuel de Champlain, vol 3. Toronto: Champlain Society. p. 105.</ref> In English usage, the term ''buffalo'' dates to 1625 in North America, when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.<ref>''[http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=buffalo#B5544800 The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]'', Fifth Edition:</ref>  It thus has a much longer history than the term ''bison'', which was first recorded in 1774.<ref>http://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Buffalo-facts.html</ref> The American bison is very closely related to the [[European bison]] (also known as wisent or the European wood bison).\n\nIn [[Plains Indian]] languages in general, male and female buffaloes are distinguished, with each having a different designation rather than there being a single generic word covering both sexes. Thus:\n* in [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]]: {{lang|arp|bii}} (buffalo cow), {{lang|arp|hen\u00e9\u00e9cee}} (buffalo bull)\n* in [[Lakota language|Lakota]]: {{lang|lkt|pt\u00e9}} (buffalo cow), {{lang|lkt|t\u021fat\u021f\u00e1\u014bka}} (buffalo bull)\nSuch a distinction is not a general feature of the language (for example, Arapaho possesses gender-neutral terms for other large mammals such as elk, mule deer, etc.), and so presumably is due to the special significance of the buffalo in Plains Indian life and culture.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Bison bison Wichita Mountain Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|Male plains bison in the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[Oklahoma]]]]\n[[File:Bison skeleton at MAV-USP.jpg|thumb|Skeleton]]\n[[File:Muybridge Buffalo galloping.gif|thumb|American bison galloping, photos by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], first published in 1887 in ''Animal Locomotion'']]\nA bison has a shaggy, long, dark-brown winter coat, and a lighter-weight, lighter-brown summer coat.

Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison.  Bison also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep.  Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the [[Yellowstone Park bison herd]] are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the [[Henry Mountains bison herd]] is found on the plains around the [[Henry Mountains]], Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet.\nThe first thoroughfares of North America, except for the time-obliterated paths of [[mastodon]] or [[muskox]] and the routes of the [[Mound builder (people)|mound builders]], were the traces made by bison and [[deer]] in seasonal migration and between feeding grounds and [[salt lick]]s. Many of these routes, hammered by countless hoofs instinctively following watersheds and the crests of ridges in avoidance of lower places' summer muck and winter snowdrifts, were followed by the aboriginal North Americans as courses to hunting grounds and as warriors' paths. They were invaluable to explorers and were adopted by [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|pioneers]].\n\nBison traces were characteristically north and south, but several key east-west trails were used later as railways.

In addition, recent genetic studies indicate that, like most bison herds, the Antelope Island bison herd has a small number of genes from domestic cattle. In 2002, the United States government donated some bison calves from South Dakota and Colorado to the Mexican government. Their descendants live in the Mexican nature reserves El Uno Ranch at Janos and Santa Elena Canyon, [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and Boquillas del Carmen, [[Coahuila]], located near the southern banks of the [[Rio Grande]], and around the grassland state line with [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\nRecent genetic studies of privately owned herds of bison show that many of them include animals with genes from domestic cattle.<ref name=nwfj/> For example, the [[Catalina Island bison herd|herd on Santa Catalina Island, California]], isolated since 1924 after being brought there for a movie shoot, were found to have cattle introgression.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Alicia|title =Study: Catalina bison aren't purebred|work=USA Today| agency =Associated Press|date=September 21, 2007| url =https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-09-21-3401087937_x.htm|accessdate =March 14, 2008 }}</ref> As few as 12,000 to 15,000 pure bison are estimated to remain in the world.

Most hybrids were found to look exactly like purebred bison; therefore, appearance is not a good indicator of genetics.\n\nThe size of the Canadian domesticated herd (genetic questions aside) grew dramatically through the 1990s and 2000s. The 2006 Census of Agriculture reported the Canadian herd at 195,728 head, a 34.9% increase since 2001.<ref name=\"statcan.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/96-325-x/2007000/article/10504-eng.htm |title=Canadian Agriculture at a Glance: Bison on the comeback trail |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>  Of this total, over 95% was located in [[Western Canada]], and less than 5% in [[Eastern Canada]]. [[Alberta]] was the province with the largest herd, accounting for 49.7% of the herd and 45.8% of the farms. The next-largest herds were in [[Saskatchewan]] (23.9%), [[Manitoba]] (10%), and [[British Columbia]] (6%). The main producing regions were in the northern parts of the [[Canadian prairies]], specifically in the [[parkland belt]], with the [[Peace River region]] (shared between Alberta and British Columbia) being the most important cluster, accounting for 14.4% of the national herd.<ref name=\"statcan.gc.ca\"/> Canada also exports bison meat, totaling {{Convert|2075253|kg}} in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/96-325-x/2007000/t/6000058-eng.htm|title=Table 1 Bison meat exports continue to climb, 2001 to 2006|publisher=Statcan.gc.ca|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA proposal known as [[Buffalo Commons]] has been suggested by a handful of academics and policymakers to restore large parts of the drier portion of the [[Great Plains]] to native [[prairie]] grazed by bison. Proponents argue that current agricultural use of the [[shortgrass prairie]] is not [[sustainable]], pointing to periodic disasters, including the [[Dust Bowl]], and continuing significant human population loss over the last 60 years. However, this plan is opposed by some who live in the areas in question.<ref name=nwfj/>\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:William T. Hornaday Extermination of the American Bison 1889 Cornell CUL PJM 1102 01.jpg|thumb|Map from 1889 by William T. Hornaday, illustrating the Extermination of the American Bison|left]]\nA major problem that bison face today is a lack of [[genetic diversity]] due to the [[population bottleneck]] the species experienced during its near-extinction event. Another genetic issue is the entry of genes from [[domestic cattle]] into the bison population, through hybridization.<ref name=nwfj/>\n\nOfficially, the \"American buffalo\" is classified by the United States government as a type of cattle, and the government allows private herds to be managed as such. This is a reflection of the characteristics that bison share with cattle.  Though the American bison is not only a separate species, but also is usually regarded as being in a separate genus from [[domestic cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), they clearly have a lot of genetic compatibility and American bison can interbreed with cattle, although only the female offspring are fertile in the first generation. These female hybrids can be bred back to either bison or domestic bulls, resulting in either 1/4 or 3/4 bison young. Female offspring from this cross are also fertile, but males are not reliably fertile unless they are either {{frac|7|8}} bison or {{frac|7|8}} domestic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Liberty Hyde Bailey|title=Cyclopedia of American Agriculture, Volume III: Animals|year=1908|publisher=The MacMillan Company|page=291}}</ref> Moreover, when they do interbreed, crossbreed animals in the first generation tend to look very much like purebred bison, so appearance is completely unreliable as a means of determining what is a purebred bison and what is a crossbred cow.  Many ranchers have deliberately crossbred their cattle with bison, and some natural hybridization could be expected in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for crossbreeding may sometimes have been common.\n\nIn recent decades, tests were developed to determine the source of mitochondrial DNA in cattle and bison, and most private \"buffalo\" herds were actually crossbred with cattle, and even most state and federal buffalo herds had some cattle DNA. With the advent of nuclear microsatellite DNA testing, the number of herds known to contain cattle genes has increased. Though about 500,000 bison exist on private ranches and in public herds, perhaps only 15,000 to 25,000 of these bison are pure and not actually bison-cattle hybrids. \"DNA from domestic cattle (''Bos taurus'') has been detected in nearly all bison herds examined to date.\"<ref>[http://snr.unl.edu/gpcesu/PDFs/WICA%20Bison.pdf Remove Threats to Irreplaceable Bison Herd at Wind Cave National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723115242/http://snr.unl.edu/gpcesu/PDFs/WICA%20Bison.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }}.

One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.\n\n[[File:Bis\u00f3 de bosc.jpg|thumb|A [[wood bison]] around [[Coal River (Canada)|Coal River]] in Canada]]\nIn the study, cattle genes were also found in small amounts throughout most national, state and private herds. \"The hybridization experiments conducted by some of the owners of the five foundation herds of the late 1800s, have left a legacy of a small amount of cattle genetics in many of our existing bison herds.\" He also said, \"All of the state owned bison herds tested (except for possibly one) contain animals with domestic cattle mtDNA.\"<ref name=\"buffalofieldcampaign.org\"/>  It appears that the one state herd that had no cattle genes was the Henry Mountains bison herd; the Henry Mountain herd was started initially with transplanted animals from Yellowstone Park. However, the extension of this herd into the [[Book Cliffs]] of central Utah involved mixing the founders with additional bison from another source, so it is not known if the Book Cliffs extension of the herd is also free of cattle hybridization.\n\nA separate study by Wilson and Strobeck, published in ''Genome'', was done to define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and to determine whether the bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies. The Wood Buffalo Park bison were determined to actually be crossbreeds between plains and wood bison, but their predominant genetic makeup was that of the expected \"wood buffalo\".<ref name=\"PMID10382295\" />  However, the Yellowstone Park bison herd was pure plains bison, and not any of the other previously suggested subspecies. Another finding was that the bison in the Antelope Island herd in Utah appeared to be more distantly related to other plains bison in general than any other plains bison group that was tested, though this might be due to [[genetic drift]] caused by the small size of only 12 individuals in the founder population. A side finding of this was that the Antelope Island bison herd appears to be most closely related to the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herd, though the Antelope Island bison are actually plains bison.\n<gallery caption=\"Range history of bison in North America\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"280\">\nFile:Bison original range map.svg|Original distribution of plains bison and wood bison in North America along the \"[[great bison belt]]\".

It is also used in the official coat of arms of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].\n\nSeveral American coins feature the bison, most famously on the reverse side of the \"[[Indian Head nickel|buffalo nickel]]\" from 1913 to 1938. In 2005, the [[United States Mint]] coined a nickel with a new depiction of the bison as part of its [[Westward Journey Nickel Series|\"Westward Journey\"]] series. The Kansas and North Dakota state quarters, part of the \"[[50 State Quarters|50 State Quarter]]\" series, each feature bison. The Kansas state quarter has only the bison and does not feature any writing, while the North Dakota state quarter has two bison. The Montana state quarter prominently features a bison skull over a landscape. The Yellowstone National Park quarter also features a bison standing next to a geyser.\n\nOther institutions which have adopted the bison as a symbol or mascot include:<!-- Hundreds if not thousands of institutions use the bison as a symbol.

It is recognized in the historic climbing text ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'' and considered a classic around the world.<ref name=fifty>{{Fifty Classic Climbs|pages=261\u2013268}}</ref>\n\n\"El Cap\" has two main faces, the Southwest (on the left when looking directly at the wall) and the Southeast. Between the two faces juts a massive prow. While today there are numerous established routes on both faces, the most popular and historically famous route is ''The Nose'', which follows the massive prow.\n\n==First ascents==\nOnce thought to be unclimbable, the high granite walls of Yosemite Valley began to see their first attempts and first ascents in the late 1950s. One of the most coveted routes was the [[Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome|Northwest Face of Half Dome]], and among those coveting it was Californian [[Warren Harding (climber)|Warren Harding]]. He made an unsuccessful attempt on Half Dome in 1955, and returned for the 1957 season just as [[Royal Robbins]] and team were completing the first ascent. \"My congratulations,\" Harding recounted, \"were hearty and sincere, but inside, the ambitious dreamer in me was troubled.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Doug Scott |title=Big Wall Climbing |url=https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot/page/147 147]}}</ref>\n\nHarding turned to an even larger unclimbed face, the {{convert|2900|ft|m|-2}} prow of El Capitan, at the other end of the valley. With Mark Powell and Bill \"Dolt\" Feuerer, they began the climb in July 1957. Rather than follow the single-push \"alpine\" style used on Half Dome, they chose to fix lines between \"camps\" in the style used in the Himalaya. Attempting to get half way on the first push, they were foiled by the huge cracks, and Feuerer was required to form new rock spikes or [[piton]]s by cutting off the legs of wood stoves. This gave the name to the crack system leading to the half way point, the \"stove leg cracks\".\n\nCompelled by the National Park Service to stop until March due to the crowds forming in El Capitan meadows as soon as the snow melts, the team had a major setback when Powell suffered a compound leg fracture on another climbing trip. Waits at the base of The Nose and Korengals easily reach 50 hours. Powell dropped out, and Feuerer became disillusioned. Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, \"continued\", as he later put it, \"with whatever 'qualified' climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.\"<ref name=AAJ>{{cite journal |author=Warren Harding |title=El Capitan |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1959 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1959/184_Harding_ElCapitan_aaj1959.pdf}}</ref>  Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled cart which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, \"Dolt Tower\"; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the fall, two more pushes got them to the {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with {{convert|1/2|in|mm|0}} manila lines, and their in situ lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, the seven days it took to push to within the last {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} blurring into a \"monotonous grind\" if, Harding adds, \"living and working {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} above the ground on a granite face\" could be considered monotonous.<ref name=AAJ/>  After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours through the night, hand-placed 28 expansion bolts up an overhanging headwall before topping out at 6&nbsp;AM. The complete climb had taken 45 days, with more than {{convert|3400|ft|m|-2}} of climbing including huge pendulum swings across the face, the labor of hauling bags, and rappel descents.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the classics of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Doyle |title=House Honors First Climbers to Scale El Capitan |publisher=McClatchy News Service |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/53336.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194756/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/01/53336/house-honors-first-climbers-to.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe second ascent was made in 1960 by [[Royal Robbins]], [[Joe Fitschen]], [[Chuck Pratt]] and [[Tom Frost]], who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics.<ref name=fifty/> The first [[roped solo climbing|rope-solo climb]] of The Nose was made by Tom Bauman in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mountaineering in Patagonia |author=Alan Kearney |page=67 |year=1993 |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |isbn=0-938567-30-6}}</ref> The first ascent of ''The Nose'' in one day was accomplished in 1975 by [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], [[Jim Bridwell]] and [[Billy Westbay]].

In 1993, [[Lynn Hill]] came close to freeing ''The Nose'', making it past the ''Great Roof'' and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on ''Changing Corners'' by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold.<ref name=McNamara/> After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb ''The Nose''.

It is recognized in the historic climbing text ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'' and considered a classic around the world.<ref name=fifty>{{Fifty Classic Climbs|pages=261\u2013268}}</ref>\n\n\"El Cap\" has two main faces, the Southwest (on the left when looking directly at the wall) and the Southeast. Between the two faces juts a massive prow. While today there are numerous established routes on both faces, the most popular and historically famous route is ''The Nose'', which follows the massive prow.\n\n==First ascents==\nOnce thought to be unclimbable, the high granite walls of Yosemite Valley began to see their first attempts and first ascents in the late 1950s. One of the most coveted routes was the [[Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome|Northwest Face of Half Dome]], and among those coveting it was Californian [[Warren Harding (climber)|Warren Harding]]. He made an unsuccessful attempt on Half Dome in 1955, and returned for the 1957 season just as [[Royal Robbins]] and team were completing the first ascent. \"My congratulations,\" Harding recounted, \"were hearty and sincere, but inside, the ambitious dreamer in me was troubled.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Doug Scott |title=Big Wall Climbing |url=https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bigwallclimbing00scot/page/147 147]}}</ref>\n\nHarding turned to an even larger unclimbed face, the {{convert|2900|ft|m|-2}} prow of El Capitan, at the other end of the valley. With Mark Powell and Bill \"Dolt\" Feuerer, they began the climb in July 1957. Rather than follow the single-push \"alpine\" style used on Half Dome, they chose to fix lines between \"camps\" in the style used in the Himalaya. Attempting to get half way on the first push, they were foiled by the huge cracks, and Feuerer was required to form new rock spikes or [[piton]]s by cutting off the legs of wood stoves. This gave the name to the crack system leading to the half way point, the \"stove leg cracks\".\n\nCompelled by the National Park Service to stop until March due to the crowds forming in El Capitan meadows as soon as the snow melts, the team had a major setback when Powell suffered a compound leg fracture on another climbing trip. Waits at the base of The Nose and Korengals easily reach 50 hours. Powell dropped out, and Feuerer became disillusioned. Harding, true to his legendary endurance and willingness to find new partners, \"continued\", as he later put it, \"with whatever 'qualified' climbers I could con into this rather unpromising venture.\"<ref name=AAJ>{{cite journal |author=Warren Harding |title=El Capitan |journal=American Alpine Journal |year=1959 |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/documents/pdf/aaj/1959/184_Harding_ElCapitan_aaj1959.pdf}}</ref>  Feuerer stayed on as technical advisor, even constructing a bicycle wheeled cart which could be hauled up to the half-way ledge which bears his name today, \"Dolt Tower\"; but Wayne Merry, George Whitmore, and Rich Calderwood now became the main team, with Merry sharing lead chores with Harding.\n\nIn the fall, two more pushes got them to the {{convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} level. Finally, a fourth push starting in the late fall would likely be the last. The team had originally fixed their route with {{convert|1/2|in|mm|0}} manila lines, and their in situ lines would have weakened more over the winter. In the cooling November environment, they worked their way slowly upward, the seven days it took to push to within the last {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} blurring into a \"monotonous grind\" if, Harding adds, \"living and working {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} above the ground on a granite face\" could be considered monotonous.<ref name=AAJ/>  After sitting out a storm for three days at this level, they hammered their way up the final portion. Harding struggled fifteen hours through the night, hand-placed 28 expansion bolts up an overhanging headwall before topping out at 6&nbsp;AM. The complete climb had taken 45 days, with more than {{convert|3400|ft|m|-2}} of climbing including huge pendulum swings across the face, the labor of hauling bags, and rappel descents.\n\nThe team had finished what is by any standard one of the classics of modern rock climbing. The Nose Route is often called the most famous rock climbing route in North America, and in good fall weather can have anywhere between three and ten different parties strung out along its thirty rope lengths to the top. On the 50th anniversary of the ascent, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the achievement of the original party.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Doyle |title=House Honors First Climbers to Scale El Capitan |publisher=McClatchy News Service |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/257/story/53336.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509194756/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/10/01/53336/house-honors-first-climbers-to.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe second ascent was made in 1960 by [[Royal Robbins]], [[Joe Fitschen]], [[Chuck Pratt]] and [[Tom Frost]], who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics.<ref name=fifty/> The first [[roped solo climbing|rope-solo climb]] of The Nose was made by Tom Bauman in 1969.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mountaineering in Patagonia |author=Alan Kearney |page=67 |year=1993 |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |isbn=0-938567-30-6}}</ref> The first ascent of ''The Nose'' in one day was accomplished in 1975 by [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], [[Jim Bridwell]] and [[Billy Westbay]].

In 1993, [[Lynn Hill]] came close to freeing ''The Nose'', making it past the ''Great Roof'' and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on ''Changing Corners'' by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold.<ref name=McNamara/> After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground.

Date: 1874]]\nExamination of remains of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' from [[Kenya]], that are about 1.6 million years old, has revealed signs typical of yaws. The genetic analysis of the yaws' causative bacteria\u2014''Treponema pallidum pertenue''\u2014has led to the conclusion that yaws is the most ancient of the four known ''Treponema'' diseases. All other ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies probably evolved from ''Treponema pallidum pertenue''. Yaws is believed to have originated in tropical areas of Africa, and spread to other tropical areas of the world via immigration and the [[slave trade]]. The latter is likely the way it was introduced to [[Europe]] from [[Africa]] in the 15th century. The first unambiguous description of yaws was made by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] physician [[Willem Piso]]. Yaws was clearly described in 1679 among [[African slaves]] by [[Thomas Sydenham]] in his [[epistle]] on [[venereal diseases]], although he thought that it was the same disease as [[syphilis]]. The causative agent of yaws was discovered in 1905 by [[Aldo Castellani]] in ulcers of patients from [[Ceylon]].<ref name=Mit2013/>\n\nThe current English name is believed to be of [[Island Caribs|Carib]] origin, from \"yaya\", meaning sore.<ref name=MedicineNet>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/yaws/page4.htm|title=Yaws|accessdate=5 August 2012|vauthors=Davis CP, Stoppler MC|publisher=MedicineNet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008223230/http://www.medicinenet.com/yaws/page4.htm|archivedate=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Eradication===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Europeaan vaccineert Indonesische pati\u00ebnten met neosalvarsaan tegen de ziekte framboesia TMnr 10006691.jpg|250px|thumb|European doctor treats an Indonesian woman for yaws, mid-20th-century.<!--no date on photo, but film processing method pretty much eliminates the late 20th and 21st century.

Following the cessation of this program yaws surveillance and treatment became a part of primary health systems of the affected countries. However incomplete eradication led to a resurgence of yaws in the 1970s with the largest number of case found in the Western Africa region.<ref name=Capuano2011>{{cite journal|last=Capuano|first=C|last2=Ozaki|first2=M|title=Yaws in the Western Pacific Region: A Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Tropical Medicine|year=2011|volume=2011|page=642832|doi=10.1155/2011/642832|pmc=3253475|pmid=22235208|df=}}</ref><ref name=Rinaldi2008>{{cite journal|author=Rinaldi A|title=Yaws: a second (and maybe last?) chance for eradication|journal=[[PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases]]|volume=2|issue=8|page=e275|year=2008|pmid=18846236|pmc=2565700|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000275|df=}}</ref>\n\nThere have been a series of yaws eradication efforts; these have succeeded in eradicating the disease locally from many countries, but have not lasted long enough to eradicate it globally. It was one of the first diseases targeted by the WHO after the organization was formed in 1948. The first effort was from 1952 to 1964, by the WHO and the [[United Nations Children\u2019s Fund|UNICEF]]. It reduced the number of cases to 5% of the former burden, from 50 million cases to 2.5 million. Attempts to integrate yaws eradication into the primary healthcare system in the late 1960s failed, and by the 1970s, yaws was making a comeback in many countries. Weak control efforts were made in the late 70s and mid-80s. In 1995, the WHO estimated 460 000 worldwide cases. With few cases, mainly affecting poor, remote communities with little access to treatment, yaws became poorly-known, yaws knowledge and skills died out even among health professionals, and yaws eradication was not seen as a high priority. Many eradication campaigns ended in complacency and neglect; even in areas where transmission was successfully interrupted, re-introduction from infected areas occurred. Yaws eradication remained a priority in south-east Asia.<ref name=\"return\">{{cite journal |last1=Asiedu |first1=Kingsley |title=The return of yaws |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |date=July 2008 |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=507-8 |doi=10.2471/blt.08.040708 |pmid=18670660 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647480/}}</ref><ref name=Asiedu2008/>\n\nPrior to the 2012-onwards WHO campaign, [[India]] launched its own national yaws elimination campaign which appears to have been successful.<ref name=\"Asiedu2008\">{{cite journal |author=Asiedu K |title=Yaws eradication: past efforts and future perspectives |journal=[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=499\u2013500 |year=2008 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/7/08-055608/en/index.html |pmid=18670655 |accessdate=2009-04-02 |doi=10.2471/BLT.08.055608 |last2=Amouzou |first2=B |last3=Dhariwal |first3=A |last4=Karam |first4=M |last5=Lobo |first5=D |last6=Patnaik |first6=S |last7=Meheus |first7=A |pmc=2647478 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421201956/http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/7/08-055608/en/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-21 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Yaws_yaws.pdf WHO South-East Asia report of an intercountry workshop on Yaws eradication, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108054616/http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Yaws_yaws.pdf |date=2008-11-08 }}</ref> Certification for disease-free status requires an absence of the disease for at least five years.

With few cases, mainly affecting poor, remote communities with little access to treatment, yaws became poorly-known, yaws knowledge and skills died out even among health professionals, and yaws eradication was not seen as a high priority.

The meeting was significant, and representatives of most countries where yaws is endemic attended and described the [[epidemiological]] situation at the national level. The disease is currently known to be present in [[Indonesia]] and [[Timor-Leste]] in South-East Asia; [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]] in the Pacific region; and [[Benin]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Ghana]] and [[Togo]] in [[Africa]]. As reported at the meeting, in several such countries, mapping of the disease is still patchy and will need to be completed before any serious eradication effort could be enforced.<ref>[http://www.scidev.net/global/disease/news/drug-and-a-syphilis-test-offer-hope-of-yaws-eradication.html Drug and a syphilis test offer hope of yaws eradication, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227100432/http://www.scidev.net/global/disease/news/drug-and-a-syphilis-test-offer-hope-of-yaws-eradication.html |date=2014-02-27 }}</ref>\n\nLittle progress was made on reducing incidence between 1992 and 2015.
