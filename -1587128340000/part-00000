He was the producer of some of the Monkees biggest hits, including \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" and \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\".\n\n==Early career==\nDouglas was raised in Hawaii and began his musical career with a folk group he formed in high school, \"The Wilcox Three\", modeled after [[The Kingston Trio]]. During a trip to California, they were discovered by a well-known booking agency and signed by RCA/Camden to record an album at their studios in Hollywood.  He performed in the group using the name \"Chip Douglas\", which would be the name he would use for the rest of his career (though he would occasionally use his real name as a songwriter).  \n\nThe group dissolved and Douglas, along with [[Cyrus Faryar]] and noted rock photographer [[Henry Diltz]], formed the [[Modern Folk Quartet]] (along with musician [[Jerry Yester]]) in Los Angeles. They were signed by [[Warner Bros.]] and recorded two albums: ''Modern Folk Quartet'' and ''Changes''. They also appeared as themselves in a nightclub scene for the Warner Bros. movie ''[[Palm Springs Weekend]]'', starring [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Troy Donahue]] (1963). MFQ spent the next several years touring the U.S. playing college concerts.\n\nThe Modern Folk Quartet was signed by producer [[Phil Spector]] in 1966, and recorded a song, \"[[This Could Be the Night (1966 song)|This Could Be the Night]]\", co-written by Spector and up-and-coming singer-songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]]. The record was not released at that time, but Douglas and Nilsson became friends. In the latter half of 1966, Douglas was a member of the short-lived Gene Clark Group, a band featuring the ex-[[The Byrds|Byrds]] [[Gene Clark]], ex-[[The Grass Roots|Grass Roots]] [[Joel Larson]], and Bill Rinehart, formerly of [[the Leaves]]. Clark disbanded the group at the end of that year without having recorded or released any records.<ref name=\"part1\"/>\n\n==The Turtles==\nWhen [[the Turtles]]' bassist Chuck Portz was fired from the band, Douglas was asked to take his place. His first record with them was \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\", which they'd decided to record after hearing a well-worn demo that had been passed on by numerous other artists. Douglas played bass and did the arrangement that was recorded, and it became a huge hit for The Turtles, ousting [[the Beatles]]' \"Penny Lane\" from the #1 single position on the American pop charts.<ref name=\"part2\"/>\n\nSeeing the Turtles perform at Hollywood's [[Whisky a Go Go]] in early 1967, [[the Monkees]]' [[Michael Nesmith]] approached Douglas and asked if he would like to become the new producer for the band, who were tired of the \"manufactured\" recording setup they were accustomed to. Douglas answered, \"I've never produced a record in my life.\" Nesmith, who had produced album tracks for the group, but had little influence with their label [[Colgems Records]], assured him, \"Don't worry; if you're willing to quit The Turtles, I'll show you everything you need to do.\"<ref name=\"part2\"/><ref name=\"part3\"/>\n\nDouglas's final appearances with the Turtles were in February 1967. He was replaced by Jim Pons of the Leaves.\n\n==The Monkees==\nDouglas accepted Nesmith's offer, and joined the Monkees in the studio, first to create a new single with all four Monkees playing. It couldn't be released because of a publishing restriction imposed by [[Screen Gems]] (who both produced the Monkees series and controlled their [[music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]]). Douglas's next Monkees project was their ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'' album. Recorded over six steady weeks of sessions at the RCA Studios in Hollywood, ''Headquarters'' was the first album to feature the Monkees playing on every track. Douglas contributed a song, \"Forget That Girl\", and joined them on bass guitar in the studio. The album was released in the spring of 1967, and began a steady climb up the charts, eventually reaching #1 on Billboard's album chart, but was displaced by the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref name=\"part2\"/><ref name=\"part3\"/>\n\nNo singles from ''Headquarters'' were issued in the United States, but a non-album song from the same sessions, \"[[The Girl I Knew Somewhere]]\", reached the top 40 as a B-side. Douglas produced the hit single \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\" (written by [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]), which featured an innovative guitar intro composed by Douglas and played by Nesmith. Douglas produced the next Monkees' album, ''[[Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, & Jones, Ltd.]]'', on which he also played bass. Unlike ''Headquarters'', it was done in several different studios around the U.S. between Monkees tour dates.\n\nDouglas also introduced members of the Monkees to new songwriters, including [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]], who wrote \"[[Daydream Believer]]\", which would become their second-biggest all-time single and was included on the 1968 album ''[[The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees]]''. Douglas also introduced the band members to Harry Nilsson, who played them a selection of his original songs, and became friends with the band. One of the songs, \"Cuddly Toy\", was covered by the Monkees, and featured on both the ''Pisces'' album and an episode of their TV series. Douglas has been quoted as saying, \"I like to think I gave Harry his big break, which resulted in a record deal with RCA.\"{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDouglas was pleased to have made hit records with the Monkees, but was disappointed that they weren't able to erase the common misconception that The Monkees weren't actually musicians, and that the press took little notice of their accomplishments.<ref name=\"part3\"/>\n\n==The Turtles, revisited==\nAs 1967 ended, the Monkees wanted to take full control of their music, and said farewell to Douglas, who became a producer for the Turtles. The first project was ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'' album, the name of which was taken from the title track, co-written by Douglas and Harry Nilsson. It also included two more Turtles' top-ten hits: \"Elenore\" and \"You Showed Me\".\n\nDouglas had performed \"You Showed Me\" with Gene Clark in 1966, while he was a member of the Gene Clark Group. Originally an uptempo number, the slow, moody arrangement came about by accident. Douglas was demonstrating the song for vocalists [[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]], on an organ whose bellows was broken, requiring him to play it slowly. Douglas told them \"This isn't the way it's supposed to sound\", but Kaylan and Volman disagreed, thinking the new tempo would be perfect.<ref name=\"part4\"/>\n\n==The Monkees, revisited==\nDouglas kept in touch with the Monkees and returned in 1969 to record his composition \"Steam Engine\" with [[Micky Dolenz]] on vocals. The song appeared in reruns of their TV show.\n\nIn 1976, Douglas re-teamed with Dolenz, Jones, and Tork to record the single, \"[[Christmas Is My Time of Year]]\", co-written by Douglas and Howard Kaylan. By then, Nesmith was no longer affiliated with the group.\n\nIn 1986, a Monkees reunion tour reawakened interest in the band, and [[Rhino Records]] reissued all their original albums, including their work with Douglas.\n\nDouglas has appeared in several documentaries about the Monkees, reminiscing about his work with the band.<ref name=part2/><ref name=part4/>\n\n==Post Monkees==\nIn 1969 Douglas produced the album [[Hand Sown... Home Grown]] the first solo album by Douglas' then girlfriend Linda Ronstadt\n\nThe Modern Folk Quartet reunited in 1975 and began to perform again, often appearing at the Ice House in Pasadena, California. For several years, they teamed up with ex-Kingston Trio member [[Dave Guard]] to back him in his solo act. In the 1980s, the Modern Folk Quartet recorded several albums for a Japanese record company. They also toured Japan, where they remain popular (1988, 1990, 2003, 2005, 2011 and 2016).<ref name=\"MFQ site\"/>\n\nDouglas continues to write and produce records in a variety of genres, and divides his time between California and Hawaii.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|title=Monkeemania : The True Story of the Monkees|last=Baker|first=Glenn A.|authorlink=Glenn A.

He was the producer of some of the Monkees biggest hits, including \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" and \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\".\n\n==Early career==\nDouglas was raised in Hawaii and began his musical career with a folk group he formed in high school, \"The Wilcox Three\", modeled after [[The Kingston Trio]]. During a trip to California, they were discovered by a well-known booking agency and signed by RCA/Camden to record an album at their studios in Hollywood.  He performed in the group using the name \"Chip Douglas\", which would be the name he would use for the rest of his career (though he would occasionally use his real name as a songwriter).  \n\nThe group dissolved and Douglas, along with [[Cyrus Faryar]] and noted rock photographer [[Henry Diltz]], formed the [[Modern Folk Quartet]] (along with musician [[Jerry Yester]]) in Los Angeles. They were signed by [[Warner Bros.]] and recorded two albums: ''Modern Folk Quartet'' and ''Changes''. They also appeared as themselves in a nightclub scene for the Warner Bros. movie ''[[Palm Springs Weekend]]'', starring [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Troy Donahue]] (1963). MFQ spent the next several years touring the U.S. playing college concerts.\n\nThe Modern Folk Quartet was signed by producer [[Phil Spector]] in 1966, and recorded a song, \"[[This Could Be the Night (1966 song)|This Could Be the Night]]\", co-written by Spector and up-and-coming singer-songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]]. The record was not released at that time, but Douglas and Nilsson became friends. In the latter half of 1966, Douglas was a member of the short-lived Gene Clark Group, a band featuring the ex-[[The Byrds|Byrds]] [[Gene Clark]], ex-[[The Grass Roots|Grass Roots]] [[Joel Larson]], and Bill Rinehart, formerly of [[the Leaves]].

It is also the entrance to [[Oxford Circus tube station]].\n\nThe junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], and was originally known as '''Regent Circus North'''. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] between 1913 and 1928, the north-eastern of which has been used by [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]], [[Topshop]], the [[BBC]] and the [[London Co-operative Society]]; these are now [[listed building|Grade II listed buildings]]. Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a \u00a35&nbsp;million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including by  [[Extinction Rebellion]].\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Regent Circus North around 1850.jpg|thumb|The [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]] parading across Regent Circus North around 1840, past [[The London General Mourning Warehouse]]]]\n[[File:Oxford Circus (22891646886).jpg|thumb|Oxford Circus in 1904, still showing [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s original design]]\nThe junction was designed as part of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s work on [[Regent Street]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}} Circuses had become popular in English architecture after [[George Dance the Younger]] had popularised them in the [[Minories]] in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be [[colonnade]]d, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would \"be a nuisance by day and something worse by night\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=1}} He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller {{convert|164|ft|adj=on}} diameter reducing its land intake.  Parliament approved the design in 1813.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nConstruction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the [[compulsory purchase]] of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20134}} To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson's silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus's north-eastern section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try to accommodate them as much as possible.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nMost buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash's later work, and were based on [[Palladian architecture]]. They featured [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=7}}\n\nThe circus opened officially in November 1819.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=3}} It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding [[Piccadilly Circus]] named Regent Circus South.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1963|pp=85\u2013100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing.{{sfn|Glinert|2008|p=88}} Fellow architect [[James Elmes]] described Nash's work on the circus as giving \"an air of grandeur\" and \"as elegant in form as it is useful in application\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} The current name began to be used around 1836.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nIn 1842, the MP [[Joseph Hume]] proposed a commemorative [[obelisk]] should be constructed in the middle of the circus.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish [[vestry]] realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it. The obelisk was eventually built in 1850 at [[Nunhead Cemetery]] to a slightly different design.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=10}}\n\nIn the Victorian era, [[mourning]] was elaborate and expensive.  This area had [[mourning warehouse]]s, selling the clothes, fabrics and accessories required for this.  The most important of these was [[the London General Mourning Warehouse]] , commonly known as Jay's.  This was founded in Regent Street in 1841 and expanded north so that it occupied all of the SW quadrant of the circus by 1880.<ref>{{citation |pages=90\u201391 |title=A History of Regent Street |author=[[Hermione Hobhouse]] |year=2008 |publisher=Phillimore |isbn=978-1-86077-585-7}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:London Oxford Circus, 1949 geograph-3044387-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Oxford Circus in 1949]]\nThe lease on the four quadrants around the interchange was due to expire in 1917, and it was determined they would need to be rebuilt. In 1904, the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]] outlined a plan to redevelop Regent Street, including Oxford Circus. In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=11}} The new design was awarded in October 1910 to [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]], who saw off several rival designs, and was built in stages between 1913 and 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=14}} Tanner's design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=15}} Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.<ref name=NHLE/>\n\nThe south-eastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the beginning of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=16}} The north-western quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the [[Magasins du Louvre]]. The store was never popular and closed in 1930.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=17}} The south-western quadrant followed in 1925 and the north-eastern in 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=17}}\n\nThe new north-eastern quadrant was originally occupied by the [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]] department store.

It is also the entrance to [[Oxford Circus tube station]].\n\nThe junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], and was originally known as '''Regent Circus North'''. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]] between 1913 and 1928, the north-eastern of which has been used by [[Peter Robinson (department store)|Peter Robinson]], [[Topshop]], the [[BBC]] and the [[London Co-operative Society]]; these are now [[listed building|Grade II listed buildings]]. Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a \u00a35&nbsp;million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including by  [[Extinction Rebellion]].\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[File:Regent Circus North around 1850.jpg|thumb|The [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]] parading across Regent Circus North around 1840, past [[The London General Mourning Warehouse]]]]\n[[File:Oxford Circus (22891646886).jpg|thumb|Oxford Circus in 1904, still showing [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s original design]]\nThe junction was designed as part of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s work on [[Regent Street]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}} Circuses had become popular in English architecture after [[George Dance the Younger]] had popularised them in the [[Minories]] in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be [[colonnade]]d, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would \"be a nuisance by day and something worse by night\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=1}} He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller {{convert|164|ft|adj=on}} diameter reducing its land intake.  Parliament approved the design in 1813.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nConstruction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the [[compulsory purchase]] of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20134}} To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson's silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus's north-eastern section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try to accommodate them as much as possible.{{sfn|Bartlett|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nMost buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash's later work, and were based on [[Palladian architecture]]. They featured [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=7}}\n\nThe circus opened officially in November 1819.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=3}} It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding [[Piccadilly Circus]] named Regent Circus South.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=685}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31 and 32, St James Westminster, Part 2|editor=F H W Sheppard|location=London|year=1963|pp=85\u2013100|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref> However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing.{{sfn|Glinert|2008|p=88}} Fellow architect [[James Elmes]] described Nash's work on the circus as giving \"an air of grandeur\" and \"as elegant in form as it is useful in application\".{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} The current name began to be used around 1836.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=2}}\n\nIn 1842, the MP [[Joseph Hume]] proposed a commemorative [[obelisk]] should be constructed in the middle of the circus.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=8}} Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish [[vestry]] realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it. The obelisk was eventually built in 1850 at [[Nunhead Cemetery]] to a slightly different design.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=10}}\n\nIn the Victorian era, [[mourning]] was elaborate and expensive.  This area had [[mourning warehouse]]s, selling the clothes, fabrics and accessories required for this.  The most important of these was [[the London General Mourning Warehouse]] , commonly known as Jay's.  This was founded in Regent Street 1841 and expanded north so that it occupied all of the SW quadrant of the circus by 1880.<ref>{{citation |pages=90\u201391 |title=A History of Regent Street |author=[[Hermione Hobhouse]] |year=2008 |publisher=Phillimore |isbn=978-1-86077-585-7}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:London Oxford Circus, 1949 geograph-3044387-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Oxford Circus in 1949]]\nThe lease on the four quadrants around the interchange was due to expire in 1917, and it was determined they would need to be rebuilt.

In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site.{{sfn|Bartlett|p=11}} The new design was awarded in October 1910 to [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]], who saw off several rival designs, and was built in stages between 1913 and 1928.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=610}}{{sfn|Bartlett|p=14}} Tanner's design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=15}} Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.<ref name=NHLE/>\n\nThe south-eastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the beginning of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Bartlett|p=16}} The north-western quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the [[Magasins du Louvre]].

It has a long-standing rivalry with [[Roswell High School (Georgia)|Roswell High School]].\n\n==History==\nMilton High School was founded in the shadows of metropolitan [[Atlanta]] within the city of [[Milton, Georgia|Milton]]. It opened in 1921, serving all of the students of [[Milton County, Georgia|Milton County]] and including grades one through eleven. The school initially had no buses, school lunches, central heating, or plumbing. Its first principal was W.T. Harrison.\n\nWith the merger of Milton and Fulton counties in 1932, improvements began at a rapid pace.\n\nDue to the initiative of the Fulton Farmers of America, a cannery operated during the summers on the Milton campus. An authentic log cabin, also an FFA project, still stands as a memorial.\n\nThe 1950s brought more positive changes, and the building of an elementary school allowed Milton to house only grades eight through twelve.\n\nThe addition of a concrete football stadium drew the entire community on Friday nights to cheer for the Milton Eagles. The stadium was later named the \"Sonny\" Hawkins stadium, after the teacher who tirelessly provided over 25 years of volunteering as the public address announcer.\n\nThe 1970s represented a time of tremendous economic and social transition for Alpharetta and Milton High School. A new cafeteria, library, and front office were added.\n\nWith Milton tapped as Fulton County's first comprehensive high school, in the 1980s, programs began for learners with all abilities and interests. A middle school was opened nearby to meet the specialized needs of students in grades six through eight, which left Milton as a grade 9\u201312 facility.\n\nIn the 1990s, an enlarged and modernized Milton High School (encompassing the MHS Center for the Arts, a new greenhouse, music facilities, crematorium, and health/physical education facilities) established a stellar reputation for strong community ties, presenting a broad and relevant curriculum supported by state-of-the-art technology and a caring spirit. The school later added a state-of-the-art science wing, an enlargement of the school cafeteria, and renovations to the front office.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 school year, Milton was named a Georgia School of Excellence and a Blue Ribbon Nominee. In the 1998\u201399 school year, ''U.S. News & World Report'' named Milton an outstanding high school and a model of excellence.\n\nMilton continued to be a vital part of the Fulton County School System, characterized by economic and geographic diversity. This sprawling comprehensive high school became a unique and warm blend of the old and new.\n\nWith the new millennium came increasing numbers of students and new ideas about how best to serve young people whose adult lives would be spent in the 21st century. Unlike the schools which prepared graduates of the 1930s and 1940s for jobs right out of high school, Milton was challenged to prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Its need to expand again was in conflict with its landlocked campus in the heart of Alpharetta. After much discussion, the Fulton County Board of Education decided to build a new school in a new location.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 school year, Milton High School moved from its original location in downtown Alpharetta to a new site adjacent to the Northwestern Middle School and Crabapple Crossing Elementary in the city of Milton.\n\nThe old Milton High School facility served as the home of [[Independence High School (Alpharetta, Georgia)|Independence High School]], an alternative school serving north Fulton County until its demolition in 2017. However, the log cabin was saved and transferred to a small park close by.\n\nIt was relieved by the 2012 opening of [[Cambridge High School (Georgia)|Cambridge High School]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Scott, Jeffry|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cambridge-high-school-opens-its-doors-for-first-time-monday/LviHcCIDDiLVi3QT0hbiZJ/|title=Cambridge High School opens its doors for first time Monday|newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2012-08-13|accessdate=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==Arts==\n===Band program===\nThe Milton Band includes the Milton High School [[marching band]], a [[jazz]] ensemble, three concert bands, a [[percussion]] [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]], a nationally ranked [[winter guard]], and the Milton Indoor Drumline. The marching band has competed in many regional competitions. They have received many awards, and had the honor of participating in the [[London New Year's Day Parade]] in 2000. In recent years, the [[Wind Ensemble]] has received invitations to perform at the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia. The Milton Band is under the direction of Chris Shumick, with percussion directed by Kevin Kenny. Milton's indoor drumline has won regional and national awards as well. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, the MID was one of the finalists in the [[Winter Guard International|WGI Championships]] in Dayton, Ohio. The marching band participated in New York's Veteran's Day Parade in 2014.\n\n===Choral department===\nChoral music was added to the curriculum in 1951. The choral program consists of four choirs. \n* '''Chorale''' \u2013 The Milton Chorale is the Advanced Mixed Ensemble at Milton. The members of this ensemble are selected by audition and are 9th\u201312th grade men and women.\n* '''Women's Select''' \u2013 Women's Select is the Advanced Women's Ensemble at Milton. The members of this ensemble are selected by audition and are 9th\u201312th grade women. In previous years, men have been allowed on the team.\n* '''Concert Choir''' \u2013 The Concert Choir is open to all 9th\u201312th graders. The members of this ensemble are selected by audition. This is the entry-level choir for many freshmen.\n* '''Bella Voce''' \u2013 Bella Voce is open to all 9th\u201312th grade women. No audition is required. This is the entry-level choir for many freshmen women.\n\nThe Milton choirs consistently receive Superior ratings in Performance and Sight-Singing at the Georgia Music Educators Large Group Performance Evaluation, as well as at other festivals across the south. They have performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City three times. The groups have also performed in Honolulu, Hawaii; Orlando, Florida; and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\nAll three choirs perform three times per year at the Milton High School auditorium, in the fall, winter, and spring. Various other group and solo performances occur during the year, many by the choral extracurricular groups: the Unaccompanied Minors (a mixed a cappella group), the Milton Misses (an all-female a cappella group), and the barbershop quartet.\n\nStudents have been selected to participate in Georgia Music Educators Association All-State Chorus, the Governor's Honors Program, District Honor Chorus, American Choral Director Association Honor Choruses, Spivey Hall Honor Choruses, and other honor choirs. Students from Milton have gone on to study music and participate in college music programs including Belmont University, Columbus State University, Georgia Southern, Louisiana State University, Mercer University, Shorter College, Stetson University, and the University of Georgia.\n\nDrew Bowers has been the Director of Choral Activities at Milton High School since his appointment in 2007. He conducts the Chorale, Women's Select, and Concert Choir, and teaches Advanced Placement Music Theory.\n\n===Drama department===\nMilton has an award-winning theatre program led by Larry Smith, David Hopkins and Sim Jones. Milton Theatre won the Georgia Theatre conference with their production of the musical ''Starmites'' and came in second in the State One Act Competition with their play ''Peter and the Starcatcher''. They are also the only public high school in the country with a \"Cirque\" program, brought to the school by director Larry Smith.\n\n===Orchestra program===\nThe Milton High School Orchestra is directed by Andrew Cummings. He is the newest member of the fine arts department at Milton High School. The orchestra program consists of Chamber, Sinfonia, and Concert orchestras. The orchestras perform individually and together at least four times per year. The orchestra often arranges a full symphony concert with members from the elite MHS Band program. The orchestra also hosts multiple ensembles and quartets and encourages them (and individual players) to perform throughout the local area in an outreach program. The MHS Orchestra has been invited to the National Orchestra Festival, and has won the Smoky Mountain Music Festival.

It has a long-standing rivalry with [[Roswell High School (Georgia)|Roswell High School]].\n\n==History==\nMilton High School was founded in the shadows of metropolitan [[Atlanta]] within the city of [[Milton, Georgia|Milton]]. It opened in 1921, serving all of the students of [[Milton County, Georgia|Milton County]] and including grades one through eleven. The school initially had no buses, school lunches, central heating, or plumbing. Its first principal was W.T. Harrison.\n\nWith the merger of Milton and Fulton counties in 1932, improvements began at a rapid pace.\n\nDue to the initiative of the Fulton Farmers of America, a cannery operated during the summers on the Milton campus. An authentic log cabin, also an FFA project, still stands as a memorial.\n\nThe 1950s brought more positive changes, and the building of an elementary school allowed Milton to house only grades eight through twelve.\n\nThe addition of a concrete football stadium drew the entire community on Friday nights to cheer for the Milton Eagles. The stadium was later named the \"Sonny\" Hawkins stadium, after the teacher who tirelessly provided over 25 years of volunteering as the public address announcer.\n\nThe 1970s represented a time of tremendous economic and social transition for Alpharetta and Milton High School. A new cafeteria, library, and front office were added.\n\nWith Milton tapped as Fulton County's first comprehensive high school, in the 1980s, programs began for learners with all abilities and interests. A middle school was opened nearby to meet the specialized needs of students in grades six through eight, which left Milton as a grade 9\u201312 facility.\n\nIn the 1990s, an enlarged and modernized Milton High School (encompassing the MHS Center for the Arts, a new greenhouse, music facilities, crematorium, and health/physical education facilities) established a stellar reputation for strong community ties, presenting a broad and relevant curriculum supported by state-of-the-art technology and a caring spirit. The school later added a state-of-the-art science wing, an enlargement of the school cafeteria, and renovations to the front office.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 school year, Milton was named a Georgia School of Excellence and a Blue Ribbon Nominee. In the 1998\u201399 school year, ''U.S. News & World Report'' named Milton an outstanding high school and a model of excellence.\n\nMilton continued to be a vital part of the Fulton County School System, characterized by economic and geographic diversity. This sprawling comprehensive high school became a unique and warm blend of the old and new.\n\nWith the new millennium came increasing numbers of students and new ideas about how best to serve young people whose adult lives would be spent in the 21st century. Unlike the schools which prepared graduates of the 1930s and 1940s for jobs right out of high school, Milton was challenged to prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Its need to expand again was in conflict with its landlocked campus in the heart of Alpharetta. After much discussion, the Fulton County Board of Education decided to build a new school in a new location.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 school year, Milton High School moved from its original location in downtown Alpharetta to a new site adjacent to the Northwestern Middle School and Crabapple Crossing Elementary in the city of Milton.\n\nThe old Milton High School facility served as the home of [[Independence High School (Alpharetta, Georgia)|Independence High School]], an alternative school serving north Fulton County until its demolition in 2017. However, the log cabin was saved and transferred to a small park close by.\n\nIt was relieved by the 2012 opening of [[Cambridge High School (Georgia)|Cambridge High School]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Scott, Jeffry|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cambridge-high-school-opens-its-doors-for-first-time-monday/LviHcCIDDiLVi3QT0hbiZJ/|title=Cambridge High School opens its doors for first time Monday|newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2012-08-13|accessdate=2019-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==Arts==\n===Band program===\nThe Milton Band includes the Milton High School [[marching band]], a [[jazz]] ensemble, three concert bands, a [[percussion]] [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]], a nationally ranked [[winter guard]], and the Milton Indoor Drumline. The marching band has competed in many regional competitions. They have received many awards, and had the honor of participating in the [[London New Year's Day Parade]] in 2000. In recent years, the [[Wind Ensemble]] has received invitations to perform at the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia. The Milton Band is under the direction of Chris Shumick, with percussion directed by Kevin Kenny. Milton's indoor drumline has won regional and national awards as well. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, the MID was one of the finalists in the [[Winter Guard International|WGI Championships]] in Dayton, Ohio. The marching band participated in New York's Veteran's Day Parade in 2014.\n\n===Choral department===\nChoral music was added to the curriculum in 1951. The choral program consists of four choirs. \n* '''Chorale''' \u2013 The Milton Chorale is the Advanced Mixed Ensemble at Milton. The members of this ensemble are selected by audition and are 9th\u201312th grade men and women.\n* '''Women's Select''' \u2013 Women's Select is the Advanced Women's Ensemble at Milton. The members of this ensemble are selected by audition and are 9th\u201312th grade women. In previous years, men have been allowed on the team.\n* '''Concert Choir''' \u2013 The Concert Choir is open to all 9th\u201312th graders. The members of this ensemble are selected by audition. This is the entry-level choir for many freshmen.\n* '''Bella Voce''' \u2013 Bella Voce is open to all 9th\u201312th grade women. No audition is required. This is the entry-level choir for many freshmen women.\n\nThe Milton choirs consistently receive Superior ratings in Performance and Sight-Singing at the Georgia Music Educators Large Group Performance Evaluation, as well as at other festivals across the south. They have performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City three times. The groups have also performed in Honolulu, Hawaii; Orlando, Florida; and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\nAll three choirs perform three times per year at the Milton High School auditorium, in the fall, winter, and spring. Various other group and solo performances occur during the year, many by the choral extracurricular groups: the Unaccompanied Minors (a mixed a cappella group), the Milton Misses (an all-female a cappella group), and the barbershop quartet.\n\nStudents have been selected to participate in Georgia Music Educators Association All-State Chorus, the Governor's Honors Program, District Honor Chorus, American Choral Director Association Honor Choruses, Spivey Hall Honor Choruses, and other honor choirs. Students from Milton have gone on to study music and participate in college music programs including Belmont University, Columbus State University, Georgia Southern, Louisiana State University, Mercer University, Shorter College, Stetson University, and the University of Georgia.\n\nDrew Bowers has been the Director of Choral Activities at Milton High School since his appointment in 2007. He conducts the Chorale, Women's Select, and Concert Choir, and teaches Advanced Placement Music Theory.\n\n===Drama department===\nMilton has an award-winning theatre program led by Larry Smith, David Hopkins and Sim Jones. Milton Theatre won the Georgia Theatre conference with their production of the musical ''Starmites'' and came in second in the State One Act Competition with their play ''Peter and the Starcatcher''. They are also the only public high school in the country with a \"Cirque\" program, brought to the school by director Larry Smith.\n\n===Orchestra program===\nThe Milton High School Orchestra is directed by Andrew Cummings. He is the newest member of the fine arts department at Milton High School. The orchestra program consists of Chamber, Sinfonia, and Concert orchestras. The orchestras perform individually and together at least four times per year. The orchestra often arranges a full symphony concert with members from the elite MHS Band program. The orchestra also hosts multiple ensembles and quartets and encourages them (and individual players) to perform throughout the local area in an outreach program. The MHS Orchestra has been invited to the National Orchestra Festival, and has won the Smoky Mountain Music Festival. Individuals in the MHS orchestra have earned chairs at All-State, ASYO, MYSO, LSO, FCHO, and Spivey Chamber Orchestra, including first chair placement on several occasions. In 2016 they graduated the bassist Jan, who was named salutatorian, along with violinist Agni, who was named valedictorian.
