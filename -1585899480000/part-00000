An independence referendum that results in a vote for independence does not always ultimately result in independence.\n\nThe articles on specific referendums are linked with dates in the table on past referendums.\n\n==Procedure==\nAn independence referendum typically arises first after political success for [[nationalism|nationalists]] of a territory. This could come in the election of politicians or parties with [[separatism|separatist]] policies, or from pressure from [[list of nationalist organizations|nationalist organisations]].\n\n===Negotiations===\nNegotiations for the terms of an independence referendum may take place between the nationalists and the government which exercises sovereignty over the territory. If terms can be agreed, then the independence referendum can be held with its result binding, and respected by the [[international community]]. Independence referendums can be held without the consent of a national or the federal governments, then the international community will rely on several other factors, e.g. were the local people oppressed by the central government or not, to decide if the result can be recognized or not.\n\nVarious issues can be discussed in negotiations, such as the date and timing of the poll, as well as voter eligibility. For these instances, common electoral practice is often widely used, although there can be deviations, as seen with the lowering of the [[voting age]] for the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]].\n\nOther issues to be negotiated include what question or questions should be on the ballot, and what the voting options could be. Independence referendums can offer options of greater [[autonomy]] as well as, or instead of, the status quo. They can also put forward other [[constitution]]al questions to ballot. The questions that referendums ask may be revised if parties involved in negotiations consider them to be too [[Leading question|leading]].\n\nNegotiations notably need to address what would make a result binding. For some independence referendums, a simple majority is required for one option. In other cases, a quota can be used, where a certain percentage of the vote or the electorate needs to be in favour of an option for it to be binding.\n\n[[File:2014-05-11. \u0420\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0435 017.jpg|thumb|[[2014 Donbass status referendums|Donbass status referendum]] in 2014 was rejected as illegal by the [[First Yatsenyuk government|Ukrainian government]]]]\nSuccessful negotiations can be hard to achieve for nationalists, as governments can be reluctant to give up sovereignty. For example, nationalists planned to hold a referendum in [[Catalonia]] in 2014, but met opposition from the [[Spain|Spanish]] government. As a result, the [[2014 Catalan self-determination referendum|referendum that went ahead]] was unofficial and non-binding.\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn the event of a vote for independence, there may be negotiations on the terms of [[secession]] for the territory from the sovereign state. A [[declaration of independence]] for a new state is then made, and international recognition can follow, as well as membership of international organisations such as the [[United Nations]]. In cases involving non-binding referendums, this can lead to a [[unilateral declaration of independence]], and therefore [[List of states with limited recognition|partially recognised]] or [[self-proclaimed]] states.\n\nIn the event of a vote against independence, there may still be a strong nationalist movement and calls for there to be a rerun of the independence referendum. For example, after two referendums in [[Quebec]], the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] has continued to raise the prospect of holding another referendum,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29077213|title=Neverendum referendum: Voting on independence, Quebec-style|date=8 September 2014|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> and the [[Scottish National Party]] has said that there should be a repeat of the 2014 referendum if the [[United Kingdom]] leaves the [[European Union]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== Past independence referendums ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!Proposed State\n!Year\n!Former State\n!Majority for Independence\n!Independence\n!Recognition\n!Notes\n|-\n| {{flag|Chile}}\n| [[1817 Chilean independence referendum|1817]]\n| {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg}} [[Captaincy General of Chile]] \n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| Chile would [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declare independence]] in 1818 and would secure independence following the [[Chilean War of Independence]].\n|-\n| {{flag|Liberia}}\n| [[1846 Liberian independence referendum|1846]]\n| [[American Colonization Society]]\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of the Republic of Maryland.svg}} [[Republic of Maryland|Maryland]]\n| [[1853 Maryland independence referendum|1853]]\n| [[Maryland State Colonization Society]]\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Norway}}\n| [[1905 Norwegian union dissolution referendum|1905]]\n| {{nowrap|{{flagicon image|Union Jack of Sweden and Norway (1844-1905).svg}} [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden\u2013Norway]]}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| The referendum was on whether voters approved the ratified dissolution of the union between the two constitutional states.\n|-\n| {{flagicon image|Light_Blue_Flag_of_Iceland.svg}} [[Kingdom of Iceland|Iceland]]\n| [[1918 Icelandic sovereignty referendum|1918]]\n| {{flag|Denmark}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Dominion_of_Westralia_(secession_movement).svg}} [[Western Australia]]\n| [[1933 Western Australian secession referendum|1933]]\n| {{flag|Australia}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| \n|-\n| {{flag|Cambodia|1863}}\n| [[1945 Cambodian referendum|1945]]\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of France (1794\u20131958).svg}} [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]]\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Mongolian People's Republic}}\n| [[1945 Mongolian independence referendum|1945]]\n| {{flagcountry|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Faroe Islands}}\n| [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|1946]]\n| {{flag|Denmark}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| The Declaration of Independence was annulled by Denmark\n|-\n| {{flag|Saar}}\n| [[1955 Saar Statute referendum|1955]]\n| {{flagcountry|French Fourth Republic}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| Territory later transferred to [[West Germany]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Cameroon_(1957).svg}} [[Cameroon]]||[[1958 Cameroonian constitutional referendum|1958]]||{{flagcountry|French Fourth Republic}}||{{No}}||{{No}}|| {{Yes}}||Referendum on the new [[Constitution of France|French constitution]].

An independence referendum that results in a vote for independence does not always ultimately result in independence.\n\nThe articles on specific referendums are linked with dates in the table on past referendums.\n\n==Procedure==\nAn independence referendum typically arises first after political success for [[nationalism|nationalists]] of a territory. This could come in the election of politicians or parties with [[separatism|separatist]] policies, or from pressure from [[list of nationalist organizations|nationalist organisations]].\n\n===Negotiations===\nNegotiations for the terms of an independence referendum may take place between the nationalists and the government which exercises sovereignty over the territory. If terms can be agreed, then the independence referendum can be held with its result binding, and respected by the [[international community]]. Independence referendums can be held without the consent of a national or the federal governments, then the international community will rely on several other factors, e.g. were the local people oppressed by the central government or not, to decide if the result can be recognized or not.\n\nVarious issues can be discussed in negotiations, such as the date and timing of the poll, as well as voter eligibility. For these instances, common electoral practice is often widely used, although there can be deviations, as seen with the lowering of the [[voting age]] for the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]].\n\nOther issues to be negotiated include what question or questions should be on the ballot, and what the voting options could be. Independence referendums can offer options of greater [[autonomy]] as well as, or instead of, the status quo. They can also put forward other [[constitution]]al questions to ballot. The questions that referendums ask may be revised if parties involved in negotiations consider them to be too [[Leading question|leading]].\n\nNegotiations notably need to address what would make a result binding. For some independence referendums, a simple majority is required for one option. In other cases, a quota can be used, where a certain percentage of the vote or the electorate needs to be in favour of an option for it to be binding.\n\n[[File:2014-05-11. \u0420\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c \u0432 \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0435 017.jpg|thumb|[[2014 Donbass status referendums|Donbass status referendum]] in 2014 was rejected as illegal by the [[First Yatsenyuk government|Ukrainian government]]]]\nSuccessful negotiations can be hard to achieve for nationalists, as governments can be reluctant to give up sovereignty. For example, nationalists planned to hold a referendum in [[Catalonia]] in 2014, but met opposition from the [[Spain|Spanish]] government. As a result, the [[2014 Catalan self-determination referendum|referendum that went ahead]] was unofficial and non-binding.\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn the event of a vote for independence, there may be negotiations on the terms of [[secession]] for the territory from the sovereign state. A [[declaration of independence]] for a new state is then made, and international recognition can follow, as well as membership of international organisations such as the [[United Nations]]. In cases involving non-binding referendums, this can lead to a [[unilateral declaration of independence]], and therefore [[List of states with limited recognition|partially recognised]] or [[self-proclaimed]] states.\n\nIn the event of a vote against independence, there may still be a strong nationalist movement and calls for there to be a rerun of the independence referendum. For example, after two referendums in [[Quebec]], the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] has continued to raise the prospect of holding another referendum,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29077213|title=Neverendum referendum: Voting on independence, Quebec-style|date=8 September 2014|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> and the [[Scottish National Party]] has said that there should be a repeat of the 2014 referendum if the [[United Kingdom]] leaves the [[European Union]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== Past independence referendums ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!Proposed State\n!Year\n!Former State\n!Majority for Independence\n!Independence\n!Recognition\n!Notes\n|-\n| {{flag|Chile}}\n| [[1817 Chilean independence referendum|1817]]\n| {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Cross_of_Burgundy.svg}} [[Captaincy General of Chile]] \n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| Chile would [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declare independence]] in 1818 and would secure independence following the [[Chilean War of Independence]].\n|-\n| {{flag|Liberia}}\n| [[1846 Liberian independence referendum|1846]]\n| [[American Colonization Society]]\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of the Republic of Maryland.svg}} [[Republic of Maryland|Maryland]]\n| [[1853 Maryland independence referendum|1853]]\n| [[Maryland State Colonization Society]]\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Norway}}\n| [[1905 Norwegian union dissolution referendum|1905]]\n| {{nowrap|{{flagicon image|Union Jack of Sweden and Norway (1844-1905).svg}} [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Sweden\u2013Norway]]}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| The referendum was on whether voters approved the ratified dissolution of the union between the two constitutional states.\n|-\n| {{flagicon image|Light_Blue_Flag_of_Iceland.svg}} [[Kingdom of Iceland|Iceland]]\n| [[1918 Icelandic sovereignty referendum|1918]]\n| {{flag|Denmark}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Dominion_of_Westralia_(secession_movement).svg}} [[Western Australia]]\n| [[1933 Western Australian secession referendum|1933]]\n| {{flag|Australia}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| \n|-\n| {{flag|Cambodia|1863}}\n| [[1945 Cambodian referendum|1945]]\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of France (1794\u20131958).svg}} [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]]\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flagcountry|Mongolian People's Republic}}\n| [[1945 Mongolian independence referendum|1945]]\n| {{flagcountry|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| {{flag|Faroe Islands}}\n| [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|1946]]\n| {{flag|Denmark}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| The Declaration of Independence was annulled by Denmark\n|-\n| {{flag|Saar}}\n| [[1955 Saar Statute referendum|1955]]\n| {{flagcountry|French Fourth Republic}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| Territory later transferred to [[West Germany]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Cameroon_(1957).svg}} [[Cameroon]]||[[1958 Cameroonian constitutional referendum|1958]]||{{flagcountry|French Fourth Republic}}||{{No}}||{{No}}|| {{Yes}}||Referendum on the new [[Constitution of France|French constitution]].

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> Over the next several years a handful of loggers moved to the area, but plans for a settlement were not conceived until 1890.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=7}}\n\nDuring an Alaskan cruise via the [[Inside Passage]] aboard the steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' in July 1890, plans were drawn up for an industrial city on Port Gardner Bay by lumberman [[Henry Hewitt Jr.]] and railroad executive [[Charles L. Colby]]. Hewitt and Colby had previously met in [[Wisconsin]], where they operated lumber and maritime businesses, respectively, and in [[Tacoma, Washington]], from which the voyage began. The pair sought to build an industrial center at a site they speculated would be the first ocean port for [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], to be constructed by [[James J. Hill]], and turn it into a \"[[Pittsburgh]] of the West\".{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\">{{cite news |last=Dilgard |first=David |date=April 22, 1993 |title=Odd couple of Hewitt and Colby hatched ambitious plan for Everett |page=F5 |url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930422&slug=1697251 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> On August 22, 1890, the [[plat]] for a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the peninsula was filed by the [[Rucker Brothers]], who had moved north from Tacoma and had more modest plans for the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}\n\nBy September, Colby had secured $800,000 in funding from oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his railroad associate [[Colgate Hoyt]] to begin acquiring land while avoiding property speculators.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}} The Hewitt\u2013Colby syndicate decided to use a name without an identifiable location, naming their planned city after [[Everett Colby]], the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a \"prodigious appetite\" at a group dinner.<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\"/> The Everett Land Company was incorporated in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] on November 19, 1890, and acquired {{convert|434.15|acre|sqkm}} of property from the Rucker Brothers a week later.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=15}} The Rucker plat was withdrawn after an agreement was reached with Hewitt promising certain industrial developments under the \"Remarkable Document\", which was also used to acquire property from other landowners in the area.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=103}}\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> Over the next several years a handful of loggers moved to the area, but plans for a settlement were not conceived until 1890.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=7}}\n\nDuring an Alaskan cruise via the [[Inside Passage]] aboard the steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' in July 1890, plans were drawn up for an industrial city on Port Gardner Bay by lumberman [[Henry Hewitt Jr.]] and railroad executive [[Charles L. Colby]]. Hewitt and Colby had previously met in [[Wisconsin]], where they operated lumber and maritime businesses, respectively, and in [[Tacoma, Washington]], from which the voyage began. The pair sought to build an industrial center at a site they speculated would be the first ocean port for [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], to be constructed by [[James J. Hill]], and turn it into a \"[[Pittsburgh]] of the West\".{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\">{{cite news |last=Dilgard |first=David |date=April 22, 1993 |title=Odd couple of Hewitt and Colby hatched ambition plan for Everett |page=F5 |url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930422&slug=1697251 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> On August 22, 1890, the [[plat]] for a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the peninsula was filed by the [[Rucker Brothers]], who had moved north from Tacoma and had more modest plans for the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}}\n\nBy September, Colby had secured $800,000 in funding from oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his railroad associate [[Colgate Hoyt]] to begin acquiring land while avoiding property speculators.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=12}} The Hewitt\u2013Colby syndicate decided to use a name without an identifiable location, naming their planned city after [[Everett Colby]], the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a \"prodigious appetite\" at a group dinner.<ref name=\"Times-HewittColby93\"/> The Everett Land Company was incorporated in [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] on November 19, 1890, and acquired {{convert|434.15|acre|sqkm}} of property from the Rucker Brothers a week later.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=15}} The Rucker plat was withdrawn after an agreement was reached with Hewitt promising certain industrial developments under the \"Remarkable Document\", which was also used to acquire property from other landowners in the area.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=103}}\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

The History of Ballet in Iran. Wiesbaden: Reichert Publishingi</ref> with the Vahdat Hall constructed in the capital of the country to function as the national stage for [[opera]] and [[ballet]] performances.\n\n===Construction===\nThe complex was designed by architect Eugene Aftandilian, influenced by the [[Vienna State Opera]], and was constructed during a period of ten years starting in 1957.<ref name=\"caoi\">CAOI: ''[http://caoi.ir/index.php/en/projects/item/297-tehran-vahdat-hall-rudaki-hall Tehran Vahdat Hall]''</ref> It was equipped with the latest lighting and sound system technologies of the time, with revolving and moving stages. The main stage consists of three different levels (podiums). The auditorium seats 1200 and has two tiers of boxes and balconies. The venue was fully supplied by [[Siemens|Siemens Electrics]]. The main curtain in proscenium has a motif of a phoenix rising from the ashes, with the style of [[Persian miniature]].\n\nJust before the completion of Tehran's new [[opera house]], Nejad Ahmadzadeh, artistic director of the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]], was sent by the Ministry of Culture and Arts to the [[United States]] to visit their opera houses and study administrative, organizational, and technical constructions of American opera establishments that were deemed to be the most modern in the West. At his return, he was appointed as manager of the upcoming opera house, and established the technical, administrative, and artistic sections of the Vahdat Hall. The constructions of the hall were eventually completed in 1967.\n\n===Inauguration===\n[[File:Roudaki Hall opening, Shah and R.E. Warren.jpg|thumb|[[Robert de Warren]] (right) being presented to the former king of Iran (left).]]\nAs part of the Shah's ''[[White Revolution]]'', the Vahdat Hall of Tehran was constructed to function as the national stage for [[music]], [[opera]], and [[ballet]], and was inaugurated by former king [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] on October 26, 1967, on the occasion of their coronation. Two weeks of full house performances by international ensembles marked the coronation festivities. Numerous orchestras, opera singers, and dance companies were invited to perform for the occasion.\n\nThe hall is home to the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]]. Other troupes, ensembles, and artists, such as the Iranian folk dancers, also used the stage of the Vahdat Hall for their presentations.\n\n==Productions and guest presentations==\n[[File:Turandotrudaki.jpg|thumb|Media adds]]\n[[File:Rudakiprogramm130378.jpg|thumb|Media adds]]\n[[File:Tehran Opera Orchestra 1972.jpg|thumb|Tehran Opera Orchestra in 1972.]]\n\n=== Before the 1979 Revolution ===\n[[File:Pari-Samar-Carmen-Opera-Tehran-Persia-1975.jpg|thumb|Pari Samar, Iranian opera singer, performing in ''[[Carmen]]'' (1975).]]\n\n====Ballet====\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes}}\n* [[Bijan and Manijeh]] (1975)\n* [[La Bayad\u00e8re]] (Season 1972-73)\n* Myth of the Creation (1971)\n* [[Nutcracker]] (1971)\n* [[Bolero]]\n* [[The Firebird]] (1967)\n* [[Carmina Burana]]\n* The Witch Boy\n* [[The Fountain of Bakhchisarai]] (Season 73-74)\n* [[Swan Lake]] (Season 1971-72)\n* Petrouska\n* [[Les Sylphides]]\n* [[Giselle]] (Season 1970-71)\n* [[La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e]]\n* [[Romeo and Juliet]] (1968)\n* [[Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade]]\n* [[Copp\u00e9lia]] (Season 1972-72)\n* [[Miss Julie]]\n* [[Cinderella]] (1969)\n* [[Serenade]]\n* [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]] (1978)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Opera====\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em|rules=yes}}\n* [[Hero of Sahand (Delavareh Sahand)]]1968\n* [[Pardis and Parisa]]\n* [[La traviata]]\n* [[Orfeo ed Euridice]]\n* [[Madama Butterfly]]\n* [[Turandot]] (1971)\n* [[La boh\u00e8me]]\n* [[Carmen]]\n* [[Nabucco]] (1976)\n* [[Falstaff]] (1977)\n* [[Werther]] (1977)\n* [[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]] (1978)\n{{Div col end}}\n\nVarious national and international festivals were organized at the Roudaki Hall, including:\n\n* International Film Festival\n* Ballet and Dance Festival\n* Folk Dance Festival\n* Annual Festival of Culture and Arts\n\nSince the inauguration of the Roudaki Hall in 1967 until the last stagings in the fall season of 1978, world famous music, opera, and dance artists visited Iran to stage their works.

The main stage consists of three different levels (podiums). The auditorium seats 1200 and has two tiers of boxes and balconies. The venue was fully supplied by [[Siemens|Siemens Electrics]]. The main curtain in proscenium has a motif of a phoenix rising from the ashes, with the style of [[Persian miniature]].\n\nJust before the completion of Tehran's new [[opera house]], Nejad Ahmadzadeh, artistic director of the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]], was sent by the Ministry of Culture and Arts to the [[United States]] to visit their opera houses and study administrative, organizational, and technical constructions of American opera establishments that were deemed to be the most modern in the West. At his return, he was appointed as manager of the upcoming opera house, and established the technical, administrative, and artistic sections of the Vahdat Hall. The constructions of the hall were eventually completed in 1967.\n\n===Inauguration===\n[[File:Roudaki Hall opening, Shah and R.E. Warren.jpg|thumb|[[Robert de Warren]] (right) being presented to the former king of Iran (left).]]\nAs part of the Shah's ''[[White Revolution]]'', the Vahdat Hall of Tehran was constructed to function as the national stage for [[music]], [[opera]], and [[ballet]], and was inaugurated by former king [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] on October 26, 1967, on the occasion of their coronation. Two weeks of full house performances by international ensembles marked the coronation festivities. Numerous orchestras, opera singers, and dance companies were invited to perform for the occasion.\n\nThe hall is home to the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]].

Besides toll rings, road tolls are installed to finance certain road projects, and often also on the existing road to discourage people from using it. Some tolls use [[congestion pricing]] and/or environmentally differentiated toll rates.\n\nPrime minister [[Solberg's Cabinet]] proposed a road toll reform with four parts - a reduction of toll road operators, separation of the toll service provision for tolls and ferry tickets from the toll road companies, an interest compensation scheme for toll road loans, and a simplification of the price and discount schemes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://samferdsel.toi.no/teknologi/etterlengtet-bompengereform-men-svarer-den-pa-fremtidens-utfordringer-article33685-801.html|title=Etterlengtet bompengereform, men svarer den p\u00e5 fremtidens utfordringer?|last=|first=|date=2017-08-01|work=Samferdsel|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== AutoPASS ==\nThe Norwegian [[electronic toll collection]] system is called [[Autopass|AutoPass]], and is administrated by the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]].

Vehicles in rate group 2 will not get a discount.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ferde.no/2018/11/change-of-pricing-and-discount-system-from-01-012-18/?lang=en|title=Change of pricing and discount system from 01.012.18 \u00bb Ferde|date=2018-11-28|website=Ferde|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> Discount and other benefits is only given to vehicles with a valid tag/agreement, \"Visitors' Payment\" does not give the same benefits.\n\nIn a growing number of tolling projects, a toll fee for zero-emission vehicles for rate group 1 is introduced. Zero-emission vehicle is a collective name for electric cars and hydrogen cars, and the toll fee is maximum 50% of ordinary toll fee after discount (i.e. if the toll fee is 10 NOK, it costs 8 NOK for those with a valid tag/agreement. The toll fee for zero-emission vehicles can hence be maximum 4 NOK). The introduction of payment for zero-emission vehicles is done according to the instructions from Prop. 87 S (2017-2018) and local government. Payment of tolls as a zero-emission vehicle requires tag and a valid agreement. Without a tag and a valid agreement, zero-emission vehicles will be charged ordinary fare like other vehicles.<ref>{{Cite

Besides toll rings, road tolls are installed to finance certain road projects, and often also on the existing road to discourage people from using it. Some tolls use [[congestion pricing]] and/or environmentally differentiated toll rates.\n\nPrime minister [[Solberg's Cabinet]] proposed a road toll reform with four parts - a reduction of toll road operators, separation of the toll service provision for tolls and ferry tickets from the toll road companies, an interest compensation scheme for toll road loans, and a simplification of the price and discount schemes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://samferdsel.toi.no/teknologi/etterlengtet-bompengereform-men-svarer-den-pa-fremtidens-utfordringer-article33685-801.html|title=Etterlengtet bompengereform, men svarer den p\u00e5 fremtidens utfordringer?|last=|first=|date=2017-08-01|work=Samferdsel|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== AutoPASS ==\nThe Norwegian [[electronic toll collection]] system is called [[Autopass|AutoPass]], and is administrated by the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]].

Zero-emission vehicle is a collective name for electric cars and hydrogen cars, and the toll fee is maximum 50% of ordinary toll fee after discount (i.e. if the toll fee is 10 NOK, it costs 8 NOK for those with a valid tag/agreement. The toll fee for zero-emission vehicles can hence be maximum 4 NOK). The introduction of payment for zero-emission vehicles is done according to the instructions from Prop. 87 S (2017-2018) and local government.
