{"title_page": "Unit disk graph", "text_new": "[[Image:Unit disk graph.svg|thumb|A collection of unit circles and the corresponding unit disk graph.]]\n\nIn [[geometric graph theory]], a '''unit disk graph''' is the [[intersection graph]] of a family of [[unit disk]]s in the [[Euclidean plane]]. That is, it is a graph with one vertex for each disk in the family, and with an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding vertices lie within a unit distance of each other.\n\nThey are commonly formed from a [[Poisson point process]], making them a simple example of a random structure.\n\n==Definitions==\nThere are several possible definitions of the unit disk graph, equivalent to each other up to a choice of scale factor:\n* A graph formed from a collection of points in the Euclidean plane, in which two points are connected if their distance is below a fixed threshold.\n* An intersection graph of equal-radius circles, or of equal-radius disks (see Fig. 1).\n* A graph formed from a collection of equal-radius circles, in which two circles are connected by an edge if one circle contains the centre of the other circle.\n\n==Properties==\nEvery [[induced subgraph]] of a unit disk graph is also a unit disk graph.  An example of a graph that is not a unit disk graph is the [[Star (graph theory)|star]] K<sub>1,7</sub> with one central node connected to seven leaves: if each of seven unit disks touches a common unit disk, some two of the seven disks must touch each other (as the [[kissing number]] in the plane is 6). Therefore, unit disk graphs cannot contain an induced K<sub>1,7</sub> subgraph.\n\n==Applications==\nBeginning with the work of {{harvtxt|Huson|Sen|1995}}, unit disk graphs have been used in [[computer science]] to model the topology of [[Mobile ad hoc network|ad hoc wireless communication networks]]. In this application, nodes are connected through a direct wireless connection without a [[base station]]. It is assumed that all nodes are homogeneous and equipped with [[omnidirectional antenna]]s. Node locations are modelled as Euclidean points, and the area within which a signal from one node can be received by another node is modelled as a circle. If all nodes have transmitters of equal power, these circles are all equal. Random geometric graphs, formed as unit disk graphs with randomly generated disk centres, have also been used as a model of [[Percolation_theory|percolation]] and various other phenomena.<ref>See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Dall|Christensen|2002}}.</ref>\n\n==Computational complexity==\nIf one is given a collection of unit disks (or their centres) in a space of any fixed dimension, it is possible to construct the corresponding unit disk graph in [[linear time]], by rounding the centres to nearby [[integer lattice|integer grid]] points, using a [[hash table]] to find all pairs of centres within constant distance of each other, and filtering the resulting list of pairs for the ones whose circles intersect. The ratio of the number of pairs considered by this algorithm to the number of edges in the eventual graph is a constant, giving the linear time bound. However, this constant [[exponential growth|grows exponentially]] as a function of the dimension {{harv|Bentley|Stanat|Williams|1977}}.\n\nIt is [[NP-hard]] (more specifically, complete for the [[existential theory of the reals]]) to determine whether a graph, given without geometry, can be represented as a unit disk graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Breu|Kirkpatrick|1998}}; {{harvtxt|Kang|M\u00fcller|2011}}.</ref> Additionally, it is provably impossible in polynomial time to output explicit coordinates of a unit disk graph representation: there exist unit disk graphs that require exponentially many bits of precision in any such representation.<ref>{{harvtxt|McDiarmid|Mueller|2011}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, many important and difficult graph optimization problems such as [[maximum independent set]], [[graph coloring]], and minimum [[dominating set]] can be [[Approximation algorithm|approximated]] efficiently by using the geometric structure of these graphs,<ref>{{harvtxt|Marathe|Breu|Hunt, III|Ravi|1994}}; {{harvtxt|Matsui|2000}}.</ref> and the [[maximum clique problem]] can be solved exactly for these graphs in polynomial time, given a disk representation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|Colbourn|Johnson|1990}}.</ref> Even if a disk representation is not known, and an abstract graph is given as input, it is possible in polynomial time to produce either a maximum clique or a proof that the graph is not a unit disk graph,{{sfnp|Raghavan|Spinrad|2003}} and to 3-approximate the optimum coloring by using a [[greedy coloring]] algorithm.{{sfnp|Gr\u00e4f|Stumpf|Wei\u00dfenfels|1998}}\n\nWhen a given vertex set forms a subset of a [[Hexagonal lattice|triangular lattice]], a necessary and sufficient condition for the [[perfect graph|perfectness]] of a unit graph is known.<ref>{{harvtxt|Miyamoto|Matsui|2005}}.</ref> For the perfect graphs, a number of NP-complete optimization problems ([[graph coloring problem]], [[maximum clique problem]], and [[maximum independent set problem]]) are polynomially solvable.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barrier resilience]], an algorithmic problem of breaking cycles in unit disk graphs\n* [[Indifference graph]], a one-dimensional analogue of the unit disk graphs\n* [[Penny graph]], the unit disk graphs for which the disks can be tangent but not overlap ([[contact graph]])\n* [[Coin graph]], the contact graph of (not necessarily unit-sized) disks\n* [[Vietoris\u2013Rips complex]], a generalization of the unit disk graph that constructs higher-order topological spaces from unit distances in a metric space\n* [[Unit distance graph]], a graph formed by connecting points that are at distance exactly one rather than (as here) at most a given threshold\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Bentley | first1 = Jon L. | author1-link = Jon Bentley (computer scientist)\n | last2 = Stanat | first2 = Donald F.\n | last3 = Williams | first3 = E.

W. Awdry]].\n\nThis article lists and details episodes from the third series of the show, which was first broadcast in the United States in 1991 as part of ''[[Shining Time Station]]'', and followed a year later in the United Kingdom. This series was narrated by [[Michael Angelis]] for the UK audiences, while [[George Carlin]] narrated the episodes for the US audiences.\n\nSome episodes in this series have 1 title: the original from the American titles are shown underneath.\n\nIn the US, this season was aired from 18 November 1991 to 20 August 1993 on the [[PBS]] television network.\n\nOn episodes 1\u201316, the UK narration uses a different [[take]] on the TV broadcast compared to the VHS releases.<ref>Audio from ''Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends: Time for Trouble and other stories'' (1991).</ref><ref>Audio from ''Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends: Trust Thomas and other stories'' (1991).</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Filming ===\nSeries 3 was produced in 1991 and 1992 by The Britt Allcroft Company in association with Japanese television station [[Fuji Television]].

Producer [[Robert D. Cardona]] left before series 3, and [[Britt Allcroft]] took his place as co-producer alongside [[David Mitton]].\n\n=== Stories ===\nThe series was a combination of episodes derived from ''The Railway Series'', stories in the ''Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends'' magazine (written by Andrew Brenner, the show's head writer from 2013\u201318), and a couple of original stories by Allcroft and Mitton. One of the primary reasons for diverging from the original books was that many of the stories not yet used featured large numbers of new characters, which would be expensive to produce. Another was that the producers wanted more stories about [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]], the nominal main character. Awdry complained that the new stories would be unrealistic (see [[Henry the Green Engine]] for more details).<ref name=sibley />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#FDD300|overall=|season=|title=|titleT=UK title (top)<hr />US title (bottom)|director=|aux2=|aux2T=Source|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Thomas & Friends (series 3)\n |EpisodeNumber=53\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=A Scarf for Percy\n |DirectedBy= [[David Mitton]]\n |Aux2=''[[List of Railway Series books#Henry the Green Engine|Henry the Green Engine]]''<br />by [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev.

W. Awdry]].\n\nThis article lists and details episodes from the third series of the show, which was first broadcast in the United States in 1991 as part of ''[[Shining Time Station]]'', and followed a year later in the United Kingdom. This series was narrated by [[Michael Angelis]] for the UK audiences, while [[George Carlin]] narrated the episodes for the US audiences.\n\nSome episodes in this series have 1 title: the original from the American titles are shown underneath.\n\nIn the US, this season was aired from 18 November 1991 to 20 August 1993 on the [[PBS]] television network.\n\nOn episodes 1\u201316, the UK narration uses a different [[take]] on the TV broadcast compared to the VHS releases.<ref>Audio from ''Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends: Time for Trouble and other stories'' (1991).</ref><ref>Audio from ''Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends: Trust Thomas and other stories'' (1991).</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Filming ===\nSeries 3 was produced in 1991 and 1992 by The Britt Allcroft Company in association with Japanese television station [[Fuji Television]]. It was divided into 2 parts, one part having 16 episodes and the other having 10. 16 episodes aired in the United States in 1991 as part of ''Shining Time Station'', and the last 10 episodes aired on the same program in 1992. It was made at a cost of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,300,000.<ref name=sibley>{{cite book\n  | last =Sibley\n  | first =Brian| authorlink = Brian Sibley| title = The Thomas the Tank Engine Man| publisher = Heinemann| year = 1995| page = 318| isbn = 0-434-96909-5}}</ref>\nBefore production of series 3, [[Clearwater Features]] closed down, with The Britt Allcroft Company becoming the sole producer. Producer [[Robert D. Cardona]] left before series 3, and [[Britt Allcroft]] took his place as co-producer alongside [[David Mitton]].\n\n=== Stories ===\nThe series was a combination of episodes derived from ''The Railway Series'', stories in the ''Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends'' magazine (written by Andrew Brenner, the show's head writer from 2013\u201318), and a couple of original stories by Allcroft and Mitton. One of the primary reasons for diverging from the original books was that many of the stories not yet used featured large numbers of new characters, which would be expensive to produce. Another was that the producers wanted more stories about [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]], the nominal main character. Awdry complained that the new stories would be unrealistic (see [[Henry the Green Engine]] for more details).<ref name=sibley />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#FDD300|overall=|season=|title=|titleT=UK title (top)<hr />US title (bottom)|director=|aux2=|aux2T=Source|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Thomas & Friends (series 3)\n |EpisodeNumber=53\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=A Scarf for Percy\n |DirectedBy= [[David Mitton]]\n |Aux2=''[[List of Railway Series books#Henry the Green Engine|Henry the Green Engine]]''<br />by [[Wilbert Awdry|Rev.

Jim Cornette was critical of Gunn being placed in a match with a pro boxer.<ref name=\"Cornette\"/> Bob Holly claimed that Gunn's inevitable loss to Butterbean was a punishment for defeating the company's desired winner, Steve Williams.<ref name=\"Holly\"/>\n\nMost of the other participants departed the company within a year after the tournament; [[Steve Blackman]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] left in 2002 and [[Bob Holly]] stayed with the company (now renamed WWE) until 2009.\n\n==Brawl for All tournament bracket==\n<onlyinclude><small>KO - knockout; TKO - technical knockout; Pts - points; Dec - referee's/judge's decision</small>\n{{16TeamBracket\n| RD1-seed01=Raw\n| RD1-seed02=6/29\n| RD1-team01='''[[Steve Blackman]]''' <sup>'''1'''</sup>\n| RD1-team02=[[Marc Mero]]\n| RD1-score01=Dec\n| RD1-score02=\n| RD1-seed03=Raw\n| RD1-seed04=6/29\n| RD1-team03=[[Mark Canterbury]]\n| RD1-team04='''[[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]'''\n| RD1-score03=\n| RD1-score04=Pts\n| RD1-seed05=Raw\n| RD1-seed06=7/6\n| RD1-team05=[[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]]\n| RD1-team06='''[[Savio Vega]]'''\n| RD1-score05=\n| RD1-score06=Pts\n| RD1-seed07=Raw\n| RD1-seed08=7/6\n| RD1-team07=[[Darren Drozdov|Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov]] <sup>'''2'''</sup>\n| RD1-team08=[[Road Warrior Hawk]]\n| RD1-score07=Draw\n| RD1-score08=Draw\n| RD1-seed09=Raw\n| RD1-seed10=7/13\n| RD1-team09='''[[Mike Plotcheck|Bart Gunn]]'''\n| RD1-team10=[[Bob Holly]]\n| RD1-score09=Dec\n| RD1-score10=\n| RD1-seed11=Raw\n| RD1-seed12=7/20\n| RD1-team11=[[Carl Ouellet|Quebecer Pierre]]\n| RD1-team12='''[[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]]'''\n| RD1-score11=\n| RD1-score12=TKO\n| RD1-seed13=Raw\n| RD1-seed14=7/13\n| RD1-team13=[[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]]\n| RD1-team14='''[[Dan Severn]]''' <sup>'''3'''</sup>\n| RD1-score13=\n| RD1-score14=Pts\n| RD1-seed15=Raw\n| RD1-seed16=7/20\n| RD1-team15=[[Harris Brothers|8-Ball]]\n| RD1-team16='''[[2 Cold Scorpio|Scorpio]]'''\n| RD1-score15=\n| RD1-score16=Pts\n| RD2-seed01=Raw\n| RD2-seed02=8/10\n| RD2-team01=Marc Mero\n| RD2-team02='''Bradshaw'''\n| RD2-score01=\n| RD2-score02=Pts\n| RD2-seed03=Raw\n| RD2-seed04=8/10\n| RD2-team03=Savio Vega\n| RD2-team04='''Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov'''\n| RD2-score03=\n| RD2-score04=Pts\n| RD2-seed05=Raw\n| RD2-seed06=7/27\n| RD2-team05='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD2-team06=Steve Williams\n| RD2-score05=KO\n| RD2-score06=\n| RD2-seed07=Raw\n| RD2-seed08=8/3\n| RD2-team07='''The Godfather'''\n| RD2-team08=Scorpio\n| RD2-score07=Pts\n| RD2-score08=\n| RD3-seed01=Raw\n| RD3-seed02=8/17\n| RD3-team01='''Bradshaw'''\n| RD3-team02=Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov\n| RD3-score01=Pts\n| RD3-score02=\n| RD3-seed03=Raw\n| RD3-seed04=8/17\n| RD3-team03='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD3-team04=The Godfather\n| RD3-score03=KO\n| RD3-score04=\n| RD4-seed01=Raw\n| RD4-seed02=8/24\n| RD4-team01=Bradshaw\n| RD4-team02='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD4-score01=\n| RD4-score02=KO\n}}\n\n<sup>1</sup> Steve Blackman won the bout, but was forced to withdraw due to an injury sustained in training.
