The song was written by Mars, [[Philip Lawrence (songwriter)|Philip Lawrence]], Christopher Brody Brown, [[James Fauntleroy]], Jonathan Yip, Ray Romulus, Jeremy Reeves and Ray McCullough II. The former three produced the it under the name Shampoo Press & Curl, along with the latter four, as [[The Stereotypes]]. The song was composed after a jam session as Mars wanted to recreate the \"[[new jack swing]] sound\". Atlantic Records released a remix version, featuring verses from American rapper [[Cardi B]], as the album's fifth and final single on January 4, 2018, to [[Music download|digital download]] and [[Streaming media|streaming services]]. Musically, it is a new jack swing, [[hip hop soul]] and [[funk]] song with a light influence of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The lyrics demonstrate the happiness of being with who one loves and the positive outcome of that for them and others.\n\n\"Finesse\" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]], who complimented Cardi B's verses, on the remix, and compared them to the old-school [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] flow. Moreover, according to critics, the song evokes the sound of [[Bobby Brown]]'s album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'' (1988), [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s track \"[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]\" (1990), and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Remember the Time]]\" (1992). The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two in New Zealand, number three in the United States and Canada. Is has also entered the top ten of Australia, Ireland, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The song was certified four and three times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), respectively. It was also certified platinum by both the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and the [[Recorded Music NZ]] (RMNZ).\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]], which was directed by Florent Dechard and Mars, pays homage to the popular [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]'' (1990\u20131994). To promote \"Finesse\", Mars and Cardi B performed it at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]]. In 2018, the song was included on a medley of hits performed by Cardi B at the iHeart Music Awards and by Kelly Clarkson at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. It received several nominations and awards, winning [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Song|Favorite Song Soul/R&B]] at the [[2018 American Music Awards]], [[Soul Train Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2018 Soul Train Music Awards]], as well as Best Collaboration at the [[2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards]].\n\n==Background and development==\nIn September 2014, Mars tweeted, \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\", hinting he was working on new music. Following the release of the successful [[Mark Ronson]] and Mars' featured single \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" (2014), Mars headed to the studio to record more songs, and said he had no plans to release a new album \"until it's done\". The album was due in March 2016, but Mars' appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show postponed it for several months. At the time, seven songs were already recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7534116/bruno-mars-third-album-timeline-24k-magic|title=What We Know About The New Bruno Mars Album So Far|last=Redfearn|first=Dominique|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429084606/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7534116/bruno-mars-third-album-timeline-24k-magic|archivedate=April 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[The Stereotypes]] had known Mars and worked with him since 2007, but after he signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]], in 2009, they did not collaborate very often.<ref name=\"SUDK\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/stereotypes-producers-interview-2017.htm|title=Hit Writing/Producing Team The Stereotypes Co-Write & Produce Bruno Mars' #1 Hit \"That's What I Like,\" And Receive 3 Grammy Nominations|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|work=Songwriter Universe|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=June 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710184649/http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/stereotypes-producers-interview-2017.htm|archivedate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AaronBaySchuck_int.html|title=Interview with Aaron Bay-Schuck|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=December 13, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521053612/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AaronBaySchuck_int.html|archivedate=May 21, 2019|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2015, Jonathan Yip of the team talked with Mars about working together.

Mars explained, \"Anytime you see us, on tour, on TV, I want to be moving ... I was very conscious on this album of the bounce.\" However, he was not satisfied with the 20th version of the song, rearranging its groove.

The song was written by Mars, [[Philip Lawrence (songwriter)|Philip Lawrence]], Christopher Brody Brown, [[James Fauntleroy]], Jonathan Yip, Ray Romulus, Jeremy Reeves and Ray McCullough II. The former three produced the it under the name Shampoo Press & Curl, along with the latter four, as [[The Stereotypes]]. The song was composed after a jam session as Mars wanted to recreate the \"[[new jack swing]] sound\". Atlantic Records released a remix version, featuring verses from American rapper [[Cardi B]], as the album's fith and final single on January 4, 2018, to [[Music download|digital download]] and [[Streaming media|streaming services]]. Musically, it is a new jack swing, [[hip hop soul]] and [[funk]] song with a light influence of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The lyrics demonstrate the happiness of being with who one loves and the positive outcome of that for them and others.\n\n\"Finesse\" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]], who complimented Cardi B's verses, on the remix, and compared them to the old-school [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] flow. Moreover, according to critics, the song evokes the sound of [[Bobby Brown]]'s album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'' (1988), [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s track \"[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]\" (1990), and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Remember the Time]]\" (1992). The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two in New Zealand, number three in the United States and Canada. Is has also entered the top ten of Australia, Ireland, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The song was certified four and three times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), respectively. It was also certified platinum by both the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and the [[Recorded Music NZ]] (RMNZ).\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]], which was directed by Florent Dechard and Mars, pays homage to the popular [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]'' (1990\u20131994). To promote \"Finesse\", Mars and Cardi B performed it at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]]. In 2018, the song was included on a medley of hits performed by Cardi B at the iHeart Music Awards and by Kelly Clarkson at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. It received several nominations and awards, winning [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Song|Favorite Song Soul/R&B]] at the [[2018 American Music Awards]], [[Soul Train Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2018 Soul Train Music Awards]], as well as Best Collaboration at the [[2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards]].\n\n==Background and development==\nIn September 2014, Mars tweeted, \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\", hinting he was working on new music. Following the release of the successful [[Mark Ronson]] and Mars' featured single \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" (2014), Mars headed to the studio to record more songs, and said he had no plans to release a new album \"until it's done\". The album was due in March 2016, but Mars' appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show postponed it for several months.

The live show ended with Cardi B rapping verses of her single, \"[[Bartier Cardi]]\" (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammys-2018-watch-bruno-mars-cardi-bs-colorful-finesse-performance-w515868|title=Grammys 2018: Watch Bruno Mars, Cardi B's Colorful 'Finesse' Performance|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 29, 2018|accessdate=January 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034428/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammys-2018-watch-bruno-mars-cardi-bs-colorful-finesse-performance-w515868|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-bruno-mars-cardi-b-give-colorful-performance-finesse-1079461|title=Grammys: Bruno Mars, Cardi B Give Colorful Performance of \"Finesse\"|last=Perez|first=Lexy|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006165505/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-bruno-mars-cardi-b-give-colorful-performance-finesse-1079461|archive-date=October 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096768/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse|title=Watch Bruno Mars & Cardi B Perform 'Finesse' at 2018 Grammy Awards|last=Payne|first=Chris|work=Billboard|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235953/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096768/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The performance received positive reviews, who found it similar to the 1990s theme of the music video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-cardi-b-and-bruno-mars-perform-finesse-remix-video/|title=Grammys 2018: Watch Bruno Mars and Cardi B Perform \"Finesse (Remix)\"|last=Gordon|first=Arielle|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235951/https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-cardi-b-and-bruno-mars-perform-finesse-remix-video/|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCP\"/><ref name=\"PeopleMP\"/> Chris Payne of ''Billboard'' commented, \"In one of the most captivating moments if the 2018 Grammys combined for an action-packed, '90s-tastic performance.\"<ref name=\"BBCP\"/> Writing for ''Vibe'', J'na Jefferson dubbed the performance as \"stand-out\", while ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'s}} Maria Pasquine wrote, \"The duo, who broke the internet with their ''In Living Color''-inspired video, tore up the Grammys stage.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/bruno-mars-cardi-b-grammys|title=Bruno Mars And Cardi B Bring Funk And 'Finesse' To Grammys Performance|last=Jefferson|first=J'na|work=Vibe|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620084722/https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/bruno-mars-cardi-b-grammys|archive-date=June 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PeopleMP\">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-performance/|title=Bruno Mars and Cardi B Dress in '90s Gear to Perform 'Finesse' at the Grammy Awards|last=Pasquini|first=Maria|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002014305/https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-performance/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Charles Holmes from [[MTV News]] praised the performance, affirming that \"the chemistry between Cardi and Mars was so electric the duo should think about dropping a collaboration album to save 2018\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3061076/bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-grammy-performance/|title=Cardi B Didn't Win a Grammy, but her \"Finesse \" Performance won the Grammys|last=Holmes|first=Charles|publisher=MTV News|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235953/http://www.mtv.com/news/3061076/bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-grammy-performance/|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Cardi B confessed that she was nervous during the performance and decided to use a common stage fright technique in picking a blank spot in the crowd.

The Goon Show, Quatermass O.B.E, Feb 2 1959, Series 9, Episode 14, plays on the famous BBC Series \"Quatermass and the Pit\". It contains the phrase, remembered as a child on BBC radio, \"The capsule was a tube train that had been shunted into a siding and forgotten. The mystic word 'minardor' was in fact the word 'mind the doors'\"\n\nThe phrase was first introduced in 1968 on the [[London Underground]] in the United Kingdom. It is today popularly associated with the UK among tourists because of the particularly British word choice (this meaning of the verb ''mind'' has largely fallen into disuse in the US).<ref>{{cite book | title=Spontaneous Tourism: The Busy Person's Guide to Travel | author=Samans, James C. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vrpVUQ7n7oC | year=2007 | publisher=Crystal Orb | isbn=978-0-9791897-0-8 | page=298}}<br />{{cite web | author=Kuehn, Paul Richard | title=Differences Between British and American English | website=LetterPile | url=https://letterpile.com/writing/Differences-Between-British-and-American-English}}</ref>\n\n== Origin of the phrase ==\nThe phrase \"Mind the gap\" was coined in around 1968 for a planned automated announcement, after it had become impractical for drivers and station attendants to warn passengers. [[London Underground]] chose [[digital recording]] using [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] equipment with no moving parts.<ref name=Martin>{{cite book |title=Underground, Overground: A Passenger's History of the Tube |author=Andrew Martin |publisher=Profile Books |date=2012 }} page 220.</ref>{{dubious|date=May 2014|reason=Solid state memory was impractical for sound recordings in 1968}}  As [[Computer memory|data storage]] capacity was expensive, the phrase had to be short. A concise warning was also easier to paint onto the platform.\n\nThe equipment was supplied by [[AEG]] [[Telefunken]]. According to the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', sound engineer Peter Lodge, who owned Redan Recorders in [[Bayswater]], working with a Scottish Telefunken engineer, recorded an actor reading \"Mind the gap\" and \"Stand clear of the doors please\", but the actor insisted on [[royalties]] and the phrases had to be re-recorded. Lodge read the phrases to line up the recording equipment for level and those were used.<ref name=Martin />\n\nWhile Lodge's recording is still in use, some lines use other recordings. One was recorded by voice artist [[Emma Clarke]]. Others, on the Piccadilly line for example, were by Archers actor [[Tim Bentinck]] for 15 years,<ref name=\"Bentinck\">{{cite web|title=Tim Bentinck|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/01/the-voices-of-the-tube|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> but are now by Julie Berry.<ref name=\"Julie Berry\">{{cite web|title=Julie Berry's website|url=http://www.julieberry.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> At least 10 stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd. of [[Milton Keynes]]. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their industrial sales manager at the time (May 1990). It can still be heard, at Paddington for example.\n\nIn March 2013, an old \"Mind the gap\" recording by the actor Oswald Laurence was restored to the curved northbound platform at [[Embankment tube station|Embankment station]] on the Northern line so that the actor's [[widow]] could hear his voice.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21719848 | title=Mind the Gap returns after wife's plea | work=[[BBC News]] | date=9 March 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Use in Britain ==\n\n=== London Underground ===\n[[File:GT London Underground mock version.ogg|thumb|Mock London Underground announcement]]\nBecause some platforms on the London Underground are curved and the [[railroad car|rolling stock]] that uses them are straight, an [[Platform gap|unsafe gap]] is created when a train stops at a curved platform.<ref name=\"Metadyne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metadyne.co.uk/mind_the_gap.htm |title=London Underground Platform Gaps and the origins of Mind The Gap |publisher=MetaDyne}}</ref>  In the absence of a [[gap filler|device to fill the gap]], some form of visual and auditory warning is needed to advise passengers of the risk of being caught unaware and sustaining injury by stepping into the gap. The phrase \"Mind the gap\" was chosen for this purpose and can be found painted along the edges of curved platforms as well as heard on recorded announcements played when a train arrives at many Underground stations.\n\nThe recording is also used where platforms are non-standard height. Deep-level tube trains have a floor height around {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} less than [[Tunnel#Construction|sub-surface stock]] trains. Where trains share platforms, for example some [[Piccadilly line]] (deep-tube) and [[District line]] (sub-surface) stations, the platform is a compromise. On London's [[Metropolitan line]], a gap has been created between the train and the platform edge at [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]] and [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] stations. This is due to the phasing out of the old [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|\"A\" stock]] trains and their replacement with [[London Underground S8 Stock|\"S\" stock]] trains, which have low floors to ease accessibility for disabled people.<ref name=\"Metadyne\" />\n\n\"Mind the gap\" audible warnings are always played on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] platforms at [[Bank\u2013Monument station|Bank]], the [[Northern line]] northbound platform at [[Embankment tube station|Embankment]], and the Bakerloo line platforms at [[Piccadilly Circus tube station|Piccadilly Circus]]. There are markings on the platform edge which usually line up with the doors on the cars.\n\nWhile the message is sometimes played over the platform's [[public address]] system on some lines, but usually it as an arrival message inside the train itself: \"Please mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n\n== Use in Ireland ==\nIn [[Dublin]]'s [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]], the phrase \"mind the gap\" is announced at each station along the line. \"Mind the gap\" signage is also present at all stations in the city centre. In the rest of Ireland, the message can be seen on some train stations as well. On Commuter and InterCity trains, the announcement \"Please mind the gap\" is accompanied by the Irish \"''Seachain an Bhearna le do thoil''\" when pulling into stations.\n\n== The phrase worldwide ==\n\n=== In trains ===\n[[File:Warning signal in the Metro Athens.jpg|thumb|right|\"Mind the gap\" sticker in an Athens Metro train, in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[English language|English]]]]\n[[File:Metro North gap sign.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Watch the gap\" variant used on [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]] in New York]]\n[[File:Mind the gap Chinglish sign in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinglish]] interpretation of \"Mind the gap\" on a ferry dock in Shanghai|alt=A light-colored sign with Chinese characters and \"Note that the level of gap\" written on it in blue]]\n[[File:201607 Reminding Signs on Platform 8,9 of HZH.jpg|thumb|\"Mind the gap\" and \"No smoking\" notice in metal-plate at [[Hangzhou railway station]]]]\n\n\"Mind the gap\" is used by transit systems worldwide, particularly when there are stations on curves, but most new systems tend to avoid these types of stations.\n\n==== Europe ====\n* The French version, which is an {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}}, \"{{lang|fr|Attention \u00e0 la marche en descendant du train}}\" (\"Be careful of the step while getting off the train\"), is occasionally written on signs on the platforms in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] and can be heard in [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] trains. Some newer M\u00e9tro trains also play this announcement in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n* In the [[Athens Metro]], the message \"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\" is heard in both Greek and English at the station of Monastiraki.\n* In [[Stockholm]]'s [[tunnelbana]] and on [[Stockholm commuter rail]]'s stations two versions can be heard: \"{{lang|sv|T\u00e4nk p\u00e5 avst\u00e5ndet mellan vagn och plattform n\u00e4r Du stiger av}}\", meaning \"Mind the distance between carriage and platform when you exit\". It is also displayed as text on electronic displays.\n* In [[Helsinki]], on some [[Helsinki commuter rail|commuter rail]] stations \"Mind the gap\" can be heard in English, Finnish and Swedish.\n* In [[Hamburg]], passengers at the [[S-Bahn]] station Berliner Tor are warned with yellow flashing lights and the announcement \"{{lang|de-de|Bitte beachten Sie die L\u00fccke zwischen Zug und Bahnsteigkante!}}\" (\"Please mind the gap between train and platform\").\n* On the [[Berlin U-Bahn]], the phrase \"{{lang|de-de|Bitte beachten Sie beim Aussteigen die L\u00fccke zwischen Zug und Bahnsteigkante}}\" (\"Please mind the gap between train and platform edge when alighting\") is used, followed by the English \"Mind the gap between platform and train.\"\n* On the [[Madrid Metro]], a recorded warning message can be heard inside the trains when approaching a station with curved platforms: \"{{lang|es-es|Atenci\u00f3n: estaci\u00f3n en curva. Al salir, tengan cuidado para no introducir el pie entre coche y and\u00e9n.}}\" (\"Caution: station on a curve. As you exit, be careful not to place your foot between the train and the platform.\") No warning messages are heard when arriving at a station with straight platforms.\n* On the [[Lisbon Metro]] at the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal station on the blue line, the announcement \"{{lang|pt|Aten\u00e7\u00e3o ao intervalo entre o cais e o comboio}}\" (\"Pay attention to the gap between the platform and the train\") can be heard.\n* On all of the trains of the [[Milan Metro]] network, a yellow sticker on every door is clearly visible with the warning in Italian language \"{{lang|it|Attenzione allo spazio tra treno e banchina}}\" (meaning literally \"Pay attention to the gap between the train and the platform\") and also in English \"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n\n==== Asia and Oceania ====\n* In [[Singapore]]'s [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]], the phrase 'Please mind the platform gap' and 'Please mind the gap' is used in announcements in English, played in the trains whenever a train approaches an underground station after the station's name has been announced twice. It is also played on underground station platforms just after the train doors open, or sometimes, just as the train approaches the platform. Trains also have stickers pasted on the windows to caution passengers.\n* The phrase can be heard in [[New Delhi Metro]] in two languages (English and [[Hindi]]): \"{{lang|hi|(\u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e) \u0926\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u0930\u0916\u0947\u0902}}\" (\"Mind the gap\").\n* Several Chinese metro systems use the phrase extensively; on the [[Tianjin Metro]], stickers on train doors, platforms and announcements mention the gap (as well as to \"mind the gap\") in both English and Chinese. (The Chinese phrase is {{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u5fc3\u7ad9\u53f0\u7a7a\u9699}}.) Some Tianjin Metro stations are on slight curves. The [[Beijing Subway]] uses \"Mind the Gaps\" (note the plural). (In the recently opened Line 4, the phrase has gained more prominence, being played in the station every time a train comes in and, in some trains, every time before arriving at a stop.) Both the [[Shanghai Metro]] and the [[Nanjing Metro]] use versions [[Chinglish|with slightly mutilated grammar]] (\"Caution, Gap\" and \"Care the Gap\", respectively, although the Chinese is the same).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n* In [[Hong Kong]]'s [[MTR]], the phrase \"Please mind the gap\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8acb\u5c0f\u5fc3\u6708\u53f0\u7a7a\u9699}}) is announced in three languages, namely, [[Cantonese]], [[English language|English]] and  [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. In recent years, a more elaborate version of the announcement, heard on some [[East Rail Line]] stations with very curved platforms, says \"Please mind the gap and be aware of the difference in levels between the platform and the train\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8acb\u5c0f\u5fc3\u7a7a\u9699\u53ca\u7559\u610f\u6708\u53f0\u8207\u8eca\u5ec2\u5730\u9762\u5605\u9ad8\u4f4e}}).\n* On the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3]], a pre-recorded message is played at certain stations reminding passengers to \"Watch your step and watch the gap between the train and the platform as you get on and off the train\".  This is simplified in its [[Filipino language|Filipino]] translation, which simply reminds passengers to be careful in boarding and alighting the train.\n* On most [[Sydney Trains]] stations and on Waratah series train carriages, there is an automated announcement reminding passengers to mind the gap (\"Please mind the gap when boarding and alighting from the train\") as well as posters informing riders about the number of people who fall down the gap each year.\n* On many trains in [[Japan]], the message \"{{lang|ja|\u96fb\u8eca\u3068\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9593\u306f\u5e83\u304f\u7a7a\u3044\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3054\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0b\u3055\u3044}}\" is spoken. This translates as: \"There is a wide space between the train and the platform, so please be careful\". The phrase \"{{lang|ja|\u8db3\u5143\u306b\u304a\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u4e0b\u3055\u3044}}\" is also common, which means \"Please mind your step\".\n[[File:Mind the Gap MRT Thailand.ogg|thumb|Bangkok underground train announcement]]\n* In Thailand, the announcement is used a little bit differently from the London one. On [[MRT (Bangkok)|Bangkok underground trains]] and [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] trains, it says, \"Please mind the gap between train and platform\". Some grammarians argue that as specific and countable nouns, the words \"train\" and \"platform\" should be preceded by \"the\". Also, the Thai language version of the announcement does not refer to a \"gap\" but simply translates to \"Please be careful when stepping out of the train\". However, in the [[BTS Skytrain|Bangkok skytrain]] stations, the Thai announcement mentions the \"gap\", and can be translated as: \"Attention, passengers, while entering and exiting the train, please mind the gap between the platform and the train. Thank you!\" The English announcement says: \"Attention, please mind the gap between train and platform. Thank you!\"\n* Signs on ferry docks in [[Shanghai]] render the phrase in [[Chinglish]] as \"Note that the level of gap\".\n* Announcement will be made on [[Seoul Metro]] trains when arriving stations with curved platform, e.g. [[Myeong-dong Station]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 4|Line 4]] and [[Singil Station]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 1|Line 1]], says \"{{lang|ko-kr|\uc774 \uc5ed\uc740 \ud0c0\ub294 \uacf3\uacfc \uc804\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc0ac\uc774\uac00 \ub113\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub0b4\ub9ac\uc2e4 \ub54c \uc870\uc2ec\ud558\uc2dc\uae30 \ubc14\ub78d\ub2c8\ub2e4}}\" (translates as: There is a big gap between the station platform and the train, please be careful when getting off) and \"Please watch your step\" in [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[English language|English]].\n* [[Adelaide Metro]] trains conclude automated station announcements with the reminder \"Please mind the gap when alighting from the train\".\n* Many [[Queensland Rail]] trains announce \"mind the gap\" after the station name on arrival at a station.\n\n==== Americas ====\n* In early 2009 the phrase was also being used on [[King County Metro|Metro Transit (King County)]] buses in and around [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/four12/3240555536/ |title=Mind the gap (Seattle style)  |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>\n* At the stations of the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Metro]] and [[CPTM]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]] the sentence that can be heard is \"''Cuidado com o v\u00e3o entre o trem e a plataforma''\" (\"Watch the gap between the train and the platform\").\n* At almost all stations of [[SuperVia]], Rio de Janeiro suburban trains, the driver announces \"''Observe o espa\u00e7o entre o trem e a plataforma''\" (\"Watch the space between the train and the platform\"), and sometimes \"''Observe o desn\u00edvel entre o trem e a plataforma''\" (\"Watch the level difference between the train and the platform\").\n* In the [[Rio de Janeiro Metro]], the phrase \"''Observe atentamente o espa\u00e7o entre o trem e a plataforma'' \u2013 Mind the gap\" also can be heard.\n* During the [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos|CPTM]] trains trips in S\u00e3o Paulo, the announcer says, before reaching a station \"''Ao desembarcar, cuidado com o v\u00e3o entre o trem e a plataforma'' \u2013 Before leaving, mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n* The [[New York City]]-area [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]], and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=RailSafetyTo |title=NJ Transit Rail and Light Rail Safety}}</ref> use signs that read \"Watch the gap\" on trains and platforms. Because of reports of people falling through the gap, a warning is now played at every station, plus automated announcements on board the trains of all three railroads.\n** The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates LIRR and MNRR, retained New York personalities including [[Maria Bartiromo]] and [[Al Roker]] to recite the slogan. The newer trains with automated announcements also announce \"As you leave the train, please watch/step over the gap between the train and platform\" to warn passengers to use caution.\n** It is also used on the MTA-operated [[New York City Subway]] and the [[Staten Island Railway]] \u2013 on trains and platforms, and in conductor announcements.

Announcements about the warning on the public announcement system in each station can also be heard intermittently.\n* In the United States, the standard [[Amtrak]] conductor announcement when approaching any station stop concludes with \"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n* On the [[Buenos Aires Metro]], warnings on platform floors and on the door windows in the trains read \"''Cuidado con el espacio entre el tren y el and\u00e9n.''\" (\"Mind the gap between train and platform\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enelsubte.com/noticias/metrovias-coloca-advertencias-andenes-y-puertas-formaciones-1480 |title=Metrov\u00edas coloca advertencias en andenes y puertas de formaciones |publisher=enelSubte.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref>\n* The [[MBTA]] in [[Boston]] has added \"Mind the gap\" warnings near the platform edges in the 2016 renovated [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Government Center Station]].\n\n=== Other uses ===\n[[File:Mind-door-wik.jpg|thumb|right|\"Mind the gap\" doormat]]\nDespite its origin as a utilitarian safety warning, \"Mind the gap\" has become a [[Clich\u00e9|stock phrase]], and is used in many other contexts having little to do with subway safety.\n\nThe phrase is printed on iconic souvenir [[T-shirt]]s that [[Transport for London]] sells, featuring the warning printed over the network's [[roundel]] logo.\n\nIt has been used as the title of at least two music albums by [[Mind the Gap (Scooter album)|Scooter]] and [[Mind the Gap (Tristan Psionic album)|Tristan Psionic]], a [[Mind The Gap (2004 film)|film]], and a [[Mind the Gap (novel)|novel]], as the name of a [[Mind The Gap Films|movie production company]], a theatre company, and a [[board game]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19576/mind-the-gap |title=Mind the Gap (2004)}}</ref>\n\nAt least four non-fiction book titles use \"Mind the Gap\" as their primary title \u2013 the books are about generations, class divides, social science policy and the origins of human universals.\n\nThe phrase is used in many video and mobile games, including ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'', ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'', ''[[Where's My Water?|Where's My Water]]'', ''[[Temple Run]]'', ''[[Quantum Conundrum]]'', ''[[Killing Floor (video game)|Killing Floor]]'', ''[[Amazing Alex]]'', ''[[Armadillo Run]]'' and ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', and in animated series such as ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/921/921688p1.html |title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 \"Destroy Malevolence\" Review}}</ref> usually in an ironic context.

It is today popularly associated with the UK among tourists because of the particularly British word choice (this meaning of the verb ''mind'' has largely fallen into disuse in the US).<ref>{{cite book | title=Spontaneous Tourism: The Busy Person's Guide to Travel | author=Samans, James C. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vrpVUQ7n7oC | year=2007 | publisher=Crystal Orb | isbn=978-0-9791897-0-8 | page=298}}<br />{{cite web | author=Kuehn, Paul Richard | title=Differences Between British and American English | website=LetterPile | url=https://letterpile.com/writing/Differences-Between-British-and-American-English}}</ref>\n\n== Origin of the phrase ==\nThe phrase \"Mind the gap\" was coined in around 1968 for a planned automated announcement, after it had become impractical for drivers and station attendants to warn passengers. [[London Underground]] chose [[digital recording]] using [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] equipment with no moving parts.<ref name=Martin>{{cite book |title=Underground, Overground: A Passenger's History of the Tube |author=Andrew Martin |publisher=Profile Books |date=2012 }} page 220.</ref>{{dubious|date=May 2014|reason=Solid state memory was impractical for sound recordings in 1968}}  As [[Computer memory|data storage]] capacity was expensive, the phrase had to be short. A concise warning was also easier to paint onto the platform.\n\nThe equipment was supplied by [[AEG]] [[Telefunken]]. According to the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', sound engineer Peter Lodge, who owned Redan Recorders in [[Bayswater]], working with a Scottish Telefunken engineer, recorded an actor reading \"Mind the gap\" and \"Stand clear of the doors please\", but the actor insisted on [[royalties]] and the phrases had to be re-recorded. Lodge read the phrases to line up the recording equipment for level and those were used.<ref name=Martin />\n\nWhile Lodge's recording is still in use, some lines use other recordings. One was recorded by voice artist [[Emma Clarke]]. Others, on the Piccadilly line for example, were by Archers actor [[Tim Bentinck]] for 15 years,<ref name=\"Bentinck\">{{cite web|title=Tim Bentinck|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/01/the-voices-of-the-tube|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> but are now by Julie Berry.<ref name=\"Julie Berry\">{{cite web|title=Julie Berry's website|url=http://www.julieberry.com|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> At least 10 stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd. of [[Milton Keynes]]. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their industrial sales manager at the time (May 1990). It can still be heard, at Paddington for example.\n\nIn March 2013, an old \"Mind the gap\" recording by the actor Oswald Laurence was restored to the curved northbound platform at [[Embankment tube station|Embankment station]] on the Northern line so that the actor's [[widow]] could hear his voice.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21719848 | title=Mind the Gap returns after wife's plea | work=[[BBC News]] | date=9 March 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Use in Britain ==\n\n=== London Underground ===\n[[File:GT London Underground mock version.ogg|thumb|Mock London Underground announcement]]\nBecause some platforms on the London Underground are curved and the [[railroad car|rolling stock]] that uses them are straight, an [[Platform gap|unsafe gap]] is created when a train stops at a curved platform.<ref name=\"Metadyne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metadyne.co.uk/mind_the_gap.htm |title=London Underground Platform Gaps and the origins of Mind The Gap |publisher=MetaDyne}}</ref>  In the absence of a [[gap filler|device to fill the gap]], some form of visual and auditory warning is needed to advise passengers of the risk of being caught unaware and sustaining injury by stepping into the gap. The phrase \"Mind the gap\" was chosen for this purpose and can be found painted along the edges of curved platforms as well as heard on recorded announcements played when a train arrives at many Underground stations.\n\nThe recording is also used where platforms are non-standard height. Deep-level tube trains have a floor height around {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} less than [[Tunnel#Construction|sub-surface stock]] trains. Where trains share platforms, for example some [[Piccadilly line]] (deep-tube) and [[District line]] (sub-surface) stations, the platform is a compromise. On London's [[Metropolitan line]], a gap has been created between the train and the platform edge at [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]] and [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] stations. This is due to the phasing out of the old [[London Underground A60 and A62 Stock|\"A\" stock]] trains and their replacement with [[London Underground S8 Stock|\"S\" stock]] trains, which have low floors to ease accessibility for disabled people.<ref name=\"Metadyne\" />\n\n\"Mind the gap\" audible warnings are always played on the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] platforms at [[Bank\u2013Monument station|Bank]], the [[Northern line]] northbound platform at [[Embankment tube station|Embankment]], and the Bakerloo line platforms at [[Piccadilly Circus tube station|Piccadilly Circus]]. There are markings on the platform edge which usually line up with the doors on the cars.\n\nWhile the message is sometimes played over the platform's [[public address]] system on some lines, but usually it as an arrival message inside the train itself: \"Please mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n\n== Use in Ireland ==\nIn [[Dublin]]'s [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]], the phrase \"mind the gap\" is announced at each station along the line. \"Mind the gap\" signage is also present at all stations in the city centre. In the rest of Ireland, the message can be seen on some train stations as well. On Commuter and InterCity trains, the announcement \"Please mind the gap\" is accompanied by the Irish \"''Seachain an Bhearna le do thoil''\" when pulling into stations.\n\n== The phrase worldwide ==\n\n=== In trains ===\n[[File:Warning signal in the Metro Athens.jpg|thumb|right|\"Mind the gap\" sticker in an Athens Metro train, in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[English language|English]]]]\n[[File:Metro North gap sign.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Watch the gap\" variant used on [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]] in New York]]\n[[File:Mind the gap Chinglish sign in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinglish]] interpretation of \"Mind the gap\" on a ferry dock in Shanghai|alt=A light-colored sign with Chinese characters and \"Note that the level of gap\" written on it in blue]]\n[[File:201607 Reminding Signs on Platform 8,9 of HZH.jpg|thumb|\"Mind the gap\" and \"No smoking\" notice in metal-plate at [[Hangzhou railway station]]]]\n\n\"Mind the gap\" is used by transit systems worldwide, particularly when there are stations on curves, but most new systems tend to avoid these types of stations.\n\n==== Europe ====\n* The French version, which is an {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}}, \"{{lang|fr|Attention \u00e0 la marche en descendant du train}}\" (\"Be careful of the step while getting off the train\"), is occasionally written on signs on the platforms in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] and can be heard in [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] trains. Some newer M\u00e9tro trains also play this announcement in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n* In the [[Athens Metro]], the message \"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\" is heard in both Greek and English at the station of Monastiraki.\n* In [[Stockholm]]'s [[tunnelbana]] and on [[Stockholm commuter rail]]'s stations two versions can be heard: \"{{lang|sv|T\u00e4nk p\u00e5 avst\u00e5ndet mellan vagn och plattform n\u00e4r Du stiger av}}\", meaning \"Mind the distance between carriage and platform when you exit\". It is also displayed as text on electronic displays.\n* In [[Helsinki]], on some [[Helsinki commuter rail|commuter rail]] stations \"Mind the gap\" can be heard in English, Finnish and Swedish.\n* In [[Hamburg]], passengers at the [[S-Bahn]] station Berliner Tor are warned with yellow flashing lights and the announcement \"{{lang|de-de|Bitte beachten Sie die L\u00fccke zwischen Zug und Bahnsteigkante!}}\" (\"Please mind the gap between train and platform\").\n* On the [[Berlin U-Bahn]], the phrase \"{{lang|de-de|Bitte beachten Sie beim Aussteigen die L\u00fccke zwischen Zug und Bahnsteigkante}}\" (\"Please mind the gap between train and platform edge when alighting\") is used, followed by the English \"Mind the gap between platform and train.\"\n* On the [[Madrid Metro]], a recorded warning message can be heard inside the trains when approaching a station with curved platforms: \"{{lang|es-es|Atenci\u00f3n: estaci\u00f3n en curva. Al salir, tengan cuidado para no introducir el pie entre coche y and\u00e9n.}}\" (\"Caution: station on a curve. As you exit, be careful not to place your foot between the train and the platform.\") No warning messages are heard when arriving at a station with straight platforms.\n* On the [[Lisbon Metro]] at the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal station on the blue line, the announcement \"{{lang|pt|Aten\u00e7\u00e3o ao intervalo entre o cais e o comboio}}\" (\"Pay attention to the gap between the platform and the train\") can be heard.\n* On all of the trains of the [[Milan Metro]] network, a yellow sticker on every door is clearly visible with the warning in Italian language \"{{lang|it|Attenzione allo spazio tra treno e banchina}}\" (meaning literally \"Pay attention to the gap between the train and the platform\") and also in English \"Mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n\n==== Asia and Oceania ====\n* In [[Singapore]]'s [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]], the phrase 'Please mind the platform gap' and 'Please mind the gap' is used in announcements in English, played in the trains whenever a train approaches an underground station after the station's name has been announced twice. It is also played on underground station platforms just after the train doors open, or sometimes, just as the train approaches the platform. Trains also have stickers pasted on the windows to caution passengers.\n* The phrase can be heard in [[New Delhi Metro]] in two languages (English and [[Hindi]]): \"{{lang|hi|(\u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e) \u0926\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u0930\u0916\u0947\u0902}}\" (\"Mind the gap\").\n* Several Chinese metro systems use the phrase extensively; on the [[Tianjin Metro]], stickers on train doors, platforms and announcements mention the gap (as well as to \"mind the gap\") in both English and Chinese. (The Chinese phrase is {{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u5fc3\u7ad9\u53f0\u7a7a\u9699}}.) Some Tianjin Metro stations are on slight curves. The [[Beijing Subway]] uses \"Mind the Gaps\" (note the plural). (In the recently opened Line 4, the phrase has gained more prominence, being played in the station every time a train comes in and, in some trains, every time before arriving at a stop.) Both the [[Shanghai Metro]] and the [[Nanjing Metro]] use versions [[Chinglish|with slightly mutilated grammar]] (\"Caution, Gap\" and \"Care the Gap\", respectively, although the Chinese is the same).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n* In [[Hong Kong]]'s [[MTR]], the phrase \"Please mind the gap\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8acb\u5c0f\u5fc3\u6708\u53f0\u7a7a\u9699}}) is announced in three languages, namely, [[Cantonese]], [[English language|English]] and  [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. In recent years, a more elaborate version of the announcement, heard on some [[East Rail Line]] stations with very curved platforms, says \"Please mind the gap and be aware of the difference in levels between the platform and the train\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u8acb\u5c0f\u5fc3\u7a7a\u9699\u53ca\u7559\u610f\u6708\u53f0\u8207\u8eca\u5ec2\u5730\u9762\u5605\u9ad8\u4f4e}}).\n* On the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3]], a pre-recorded message is played at certain stations reminding passengers to \"Watch your step and watch the gap between the train and the platform as you get on and off the train\".  This is simplified in its [[Filipino language|Filipino]] translation, which simply reminds passengers to be careful in boarding and alighting the train.\n* On most [[Sydney Trains]] stations and on Waratah series train carriages, there is an automated announcement reminding passengers to mind the gap (\"Please mind the gap when boarding and alighting from the train\") as well as posters informing riders about the number of people who fall down the gap each year.\n* On many trains in [[Japan]], the message \"{{lang|ja|\u96fb\u8eca\u3068\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u9593\u306f\u5e83\u304f\u7a7a\u3044\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3054\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0b\u3055\u3044}}\" is spoken. This translates as: \"There is a wide space between the train and the platform, so please be careful\". The phrase \"{{lang|ja|\u8db3\u5143\u306b\u304a\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u4e0b\u3055\u3044}}\" is also common, which means \"Please mind your step\".\n[[File:Mind the Gap MRT Thailand.ogg|thumb|Bangkok underground train announcement]]\n* In Thailand, the announcement is used a little bit differently from the London one. On [[MRT (Bangkok)|Bangkok underground trains]] and [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] trains, it says, \"Please mind the gap between train and platform\". Some grammarians argue that as specific and countable nouns, the words \"train\" and \"platform\" should be preceded by \"the\". Also, the Thai language version of the announcement does not refer to a \"gap\" but simply translates to \"Please be careful when stepping out of the train\". However, in the [[BTS Skytrain|Bangkok skytrain]] stations, the Thai announcement mentions the \"gap\", and can be translated as: \"Attention, passengers, while entering and exiting the train, please mind the gap between the platform and the train. Thank you!\" The English announcement says: \"Attention, please mind the gap between train and platform. Thank you!\"\n* Signs on ferry docks in [[Shanghai]] render the phrase in [[Chinglish]] as \"Note that the level of gap\".\n* Announcement will be made on [[Seoul Metro]] trains when arriving stations with curved platform, e.g. [[Myeong-dong Station]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 4|Line 4]] and [[Singil Station]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 1|Line 1]], says \"{{lang|ko-kr|\uc774 \uc5ed\uc740 \ud0c0\ub294 \uacf3\uacfc \uc804\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc0ac\uc774\uac00 \ub113\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub0b4\ub9ac\uc2e4 \ub54c \uc870\uc2ec\ud558\uc2dc\uae30 \ubc14\ub78d\ub2c8\ub2e4}}\" (translates as: There is a big gap between the station platform and the train, please be careful when getting off) and \"Please watch your step\" in [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[English language|English]].\n* [[Adelaide Metro]] trains conclude automated station announcements with the reminder \"Please mind the gap when alighting from the train\".\n* Many [[Queensland Rail]] trains announce \"mind the gap\" after the station name on arrival at a station.\n\n==== Americas ====\n* In early 2009 the phrase was also being used on [[King County Metro|Metro Transit (King County)]] buses in and around [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/four12/3240555536/ |title=Mind the gap (Seattle style)  |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}</ref>\n* At the stations of the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Metro]] and [[CPTM]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]] the sentence that can be heard is \"''Cuidado com o v\u00e3o entre o trem e a plataforma''\" (\"Watch the gap between the train and the platform\").\n* At almost all stations of [[SuperVia]], Rio de Janeiro suburban trains, the driver announces \"''Observe o espa\u00e7o entre o trem e a plataforma''\" (\"Watch the space between the train and the platform\"), and sometimes \"''Observe o desn\u00edvel entre o trem e a plataforma''\" (\"Watch the level difference between the train and the platform\").\n* In the [[Rio de Janeiro Metro]], the phrase \"''Observe atentamente o espa\u00e7o entre o trem e a plataforma'' \u2013 Mind the gap\" also can be heard.\n* During the [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos|CPTM]] trains trips in S\u00e3o Paulo, the announcer says, before reaching a station \"''Ao desembarcar, cuidado com o v\u00e3o entre o trem e a plataforma'' \u2013 Before leaving, mind the gap between the train and the platform\".\n* The [[New York City]]-area [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]], and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=RailSafetyTo |title=NJ Transit Rail and Light Rail Safety}}</ref> use signs that read \"Watch the gap\" on trains and platforms. Because of reports of people falling through the gap, a warning is now played at every station, plus automated announcements on board the trains of all three railroads.\n** The [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), which operates LIRR and MNRR, retained New York personalities including [[Maria Bartiromo]] and [[Al Roker]] to recite the slogan. The newer trains with automated announcements also announce \"As you leave the train, please watch/step over the gap between the train and platform\" to warn passengers to use caution.\n** It is also used on the MTA-operated [[New York City Subway]] and the [[Staten Island Railway]] \u2013 on trains and platforms, and in conductor announcements.

His reign marks the end of the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\" and the start of the Abbasid restoration, but he was a largely a ruler in name only. Power was held by his brother [[al-Muwaffaq]], who held the loyalty of the military. Al-Mu'tamid's authority was circumscribed further after a failed attempt to flee to the domains controlled by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] in late 882, and he was placed under house arrest by his brother. In 891, when al-Muwaffaq died, loyalists attempted to restore power to the Caliph, but were quickly overcome by al-Muwaffaq's son [[al-Mu'tadid]], who assumed his father's powers. When al-Mu'tamid died in 892, al-Mu'tadid succeeded him as caliph.\n\n==Life==\nThe future al-Mu'tamid was a son of Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (r. 847\u2013861) and a [[Kufa]]n slave girl called Fityan.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=765}} His full name was Ahmad ibn Abi Ja\u02bffar, and was also known by the [[patronymic]] Abu'l-Abbas and from his mother as Ibn Fityan.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=68 (note 244), 115}} After al-Muhtadi was deposed by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] commanders [[Bayakbak]] and [[Yarjukh]], he was selected by the military as his successor and proclaimed Caliph with the [[regnal name]] ''al-Mu\u02bftamid \u02bfAl\u0101 \u2019ll\u0101h'' on 16 or 19 June 870. On 21 June, al-Muhtadi was executed.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=93\u201399, 115}}\n\n===Reign and relationship with al-Muwaffaq===\nThe accession of al-Mu'tamid brought an end to the turmoils of the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\", which had begun with the murder of al-Mutawakkil in 861. Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during that period, with the result that the central government lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of [[Iraq]]. In the west, [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] had fallen under the control of the ambitious Turkish soldier [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], who also had designs on [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], while [[Khurasan]] and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the [[Saffarids]] under [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth]], who replaced the Abbasids' loyal client state, the [[Tahirids]]. Most of the [[Arabian peninsula]] was likewise lost to local potentates, while in [[Tabaristan]] a radical [[Zaydi]] [[Shi'a]] dynasty took power. Even in Iraq, a [[Zanj Revolt|rebellion]] of the [[Zanj]] slaves had begun and soon threatened [[Baghdad]] itself, while further south the [[Qarmatians]] were a nascent threat.{{sfn|Mottahedeh|1975|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=313\u2013327}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=148}} In addition, al-Mu'tamid's position was undermined from within, as during the coups of the previous years real power had come to lie with the elite Turkish troops, and with al-Mu'tamid's brother Abu Ahmad Talha, who, as the Caliphate's main military commander, served as the chief intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turks. When Caliph [[al-Mu'tazz]] died in 869, there was even popular agitation in Baghdad in favour of his elevation to Caliph.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=148\u2013150}}{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=323\u2013324}}\n\nIn contrast to his brother, al-Mu'tamid appears to have lacked any experience of, and involvement in, politics, as well as a power base he could rely on.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|pp=765\u2013766}} At the time al-Muhtadi was killed by the Turks, Abu Ahmad was at [[Mecca]]. Immediately he hastened north to Samarra, where he and [[Musa ibn Bugha]] effectively sidelined al-Mu'tamid, and assumed control of the government.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=801}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=149}} Al-Mu'tamid was thus quickly reduced to a figurehead ruler, which remained the case for the remainder of his reign.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=766}} Within a short time, Abu Ahmad was conferred an extensive governorate covering most of the lands still under caliphal authority: western Arabia, southern Iraq with Baghdad, and [[Fars Province|Fars]]. To denote his authority, he assumed an [[laqab|honorific name]] in the style of the caliphs, ''[[al-Muwaffaq bi-Allah]]''.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=801}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=149}} As one of the few vestiges of actual power, al-Mu'tamid retained the right to appoint his own [[Vizier (Abbasid Caliphate)|vizier]]s, originally choosing the experienced [[Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan]], who had already served al-Mutawakkil. During his tenure, the Caliph retained some freedom of action, but after his death in 877, he was replaced by al-Muwaffaq's secretary, [[Sulayman ibn Wahb]]. Ibn Wahb was soon disgraced and replaced as vizier by [[Isma'il ibn Bulbul]]. Real power however lay again with al-Muwaffaq's new secretary, [[Sa'id ibn Makhlad]], until his own disgrace and downfall in 885, after which Ibn Bulbul became the sole vizier to both al-Mu'tamid and al-Muwaffaq.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=174}}\n\nOn 20 July 875, al-Mu'tamid formally arranged for the governance of the state and his succession: his underage son Ja'far was given the honorific name ''[[al-Mufawwad ila-llah]]'', was named heir-apparent and assigned the western half of the Caliphate\u2014[[Ifriqiya]], Egypt, Syria, the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] and [[Mosul]], [[Arminiya|Armenia]], [[Mihrajanqadhaq]] and [[Hulwan]]\u2014 while al-Muwaffaq received the eastern provinces and was named second heir, except for the event that the Caliph died while al-Mufawwad was still a minor. In practice, al-Mufawwad never exercised any real authority, and al-Muwaffaq continued to exercise control over the western provinces as well through his trusted lieutenant Musa ibn Bugha, who was named al-Mufawwad's deputy.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=766}}{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=320\u2013321}} Al-Muwaffaq's power was strengthened by the military threats the Caliphate faced on all fronts, since he commanded the loyalty of the army.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=766}} In April 876, al-Muwaffaq and Musa ibn Bugha defeated Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's attempt to capture Baghdad at the [[Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul]] and saved the Caliphate from collapse.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|p=316}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|pp=113\u2013114}} The repulse of the Saffarids then allowed the Abbasids to concentrate their resources in suppressing the Zanj Revolt in the south. The Zanj rebels had managed to capture much of lower Iraq, and inflicted several defeats on the Abbasid troops. In 879, al-Muwaffaq's son Abu'l-Abbas, the future Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892\u2013902), was given the command against the Zanj, and in the next year, al-Muwaffaq himself joined the campaign.

His reign marks the end of the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\" and the start of the Abbasid restoration, but he was a largely a ruler in name only. Power was held by his brother [[al-Muwaffaq]], who held the loyalty of the military. Al-Mu'tamid's authority was circumscribed further after a failed attempt to flee to the domains controlled by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] in late 882, and he was placed under house arrest by his brother. In 891, when al-Muwaffaq died, loyalists attempted to restore power to the Caliph, but were quickly overcome by al-Muwaffaq's son [[al-Mu'tadid]], who assumed his father's powers. When al-Mu'tamid died in 892, al-Mu'tadid succeeded him as caliph.\n\n==Life==\nThe future al-Mu'tamid was a son of Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (r. 847\u2013861) and a [[Kufa]]n slave girl called Fityan.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=765}} His full name was Ahmad ibn Abi Ja\u02bffar, and was also known by the [[patronymic]] Abu'l-Abbas and from his mother as Ibn Fityan.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=68 (note 244), 115}} After al-Muhtadi was deposed by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] commanders [[Bayakbak]] and [[Yarjukh]], he was selected by the military as his successor and proclaimed Caliph with the [[regnal name]] ''al-Mu\u02bftamid \u02bfAl\u0101 \u2019ll\u0101h'' on 16 or 19 June 870. On 21 June, al-Muhtadi was executed.{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=93\u201399, 115}}\n\n===Reign and relationship with al-Muwaffaq===\nThe accession of al-Mu'tamid brought an end to the turmoils of the \"[[Anarchy at Samarra]]\", which had begun with the murder of al-Mutawakkil in 861. Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during that period, with the result that the central government lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of [[Iraq]]. In the west, [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] had fallen under the control of the ambitious Turkish soldier [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]], who also had designs on [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], while [[Khurasan]] and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the [[Saffarids]] under [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth]], who replaced the Abbasids' loyal client state, the [[Tahirids]]. Most of the [[Arabian peninsula]] was likewise lost to local potentates, while in [[Tabaristan]] a radical [[Zaydi]] [[Shi'a]] dynasty took power. Even in Iraq, a [[Zanj Revolt|rebellion]] of the [[Zanj]] slaves had begun and soon threatened [[Baghdad]] itself, while further south the [[Qarmatians]] were a nascent threat.{{sfn|Mottahedeh|1975|pp=77\u201378}}{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=313\u2013327}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=148}} In addition, al-Mu'tamid's position was undermined from within, as during the coups of the previous years real power had come to lie with the elite Turkish troops, and with al-Mu'tamid's brother Abu Ahmad Talha, who, as the Caliphate's main military commander, served as the chief intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turks. When Caliph [[al-Mu'tazz]] died in 869, there was even popular agitation in Baghdad in favour of his elevation to Caliph.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=148\u2013150}}{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=323\u2013324}}\n\nIn contrast to his brother, al-Mu'tamid appears to have lacked any experience of, and involvement in, politics, as well as a power base he could rely on.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|pp=765\u2013766}} At the time al-Muhtadi was killed by the Turks, Abu Ahmad was at [[Mecca]]. Immediately he hastened north to Samarra, where he and [[Musa ibn Bugha]] effectively sidelined al-Mu'tamid, and assumed control of the government.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=801}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=149}} Al-Mu'tamid was thus quickly reduced to a figurehead ruler, which remained the case for the remainder of his reign.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=766}} Within a short time, Abu Ahmad was conferred an extensive governorate covering most of the lands still under caliphal authority: western Arabia, southern Iraq with Baghdad, and [[Fars Province|Fars]]. To denote his authority, he assumed an [[laqab|honorific name]] in the style of the caliphs, ''[[al-Muwaffaq bi-Allah]]''.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=801}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=149}} As one of the few vestiges of actual power, al-Mu'tamid retained the right to appoint his own [[Vizier (Abbasid Caliphate)|vizier]]s, originally choosing the experienced [[Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan]], who had already served al-Mutawakkil. During his tenure, the Caliph retained some freedom of action, but after his death in 877, he was replaced by al-Muwaffaq's secretary, [[Sulayman ibn Wahb]]. Ibn Wahb was soon disgraced and replaced as vizier by [[Isma'il ibn Bulbul]]. Real power however lay again with al-Muwaffaq's new secretary, [[Sa'id ibn Makhlad]], until his own disgrace and downfall in 885, after which Ibn Bulbul became the sole vizier to both al-Mu'tamid and al-Muwaffaq.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=174}}\n\nOn 20 July 875, al-Mu'tamid formally arranged for the governance of the state and his succession: his underage son Ja'far was given the honorific name ''[[al-Mufawwad ila-llah]]'', was named heir-apparent and assigned the western half of the Caliphate\u2014[[Ifriqiya]], Egypt, Syria, the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] and [[Mosul]], [[Arminiya|Armenia]], [[Mihrajanqadhaq]] and [[Hulwan]]\u2014 while al-Muwaffaq received the eastern provinces and was named second heir, except for the event that the Caliph died while al-Mufawwad was still a minor. In practice, al-Mufawwad never exercised any real authority, and al-Muwaffaq continued to exercise control over the western provinces as well through his trusted lieutenant Musa ibn Bugha, who was named al-Mufawwad's deputy.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=766}}{{sfn|Waines|1992|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=320\u2013321}} Al-Muwaffaq's power was strengthened by the military threats the Caliphate faced on all fronts, since he commanded the loyalty of the army.{{sfn|Kennedy|1993|p=766}} In April 876, al-Muwaffaq and Musa ibn Bugha defeated Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's attempt to capture Baghdad at the [[Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul]] and saved the Caliphate from collapse.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|p=316}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|pp=113\u2013114}} The repulse of the Saffarids then allowed the Abbasids to concentrate their resources in suppressing the Zanj Revolt in the south. The Zanj rebels had managed to capture much of lower Iraq, and inflicted several defeats on the Abbasid troops. In 879, al-Muwaffaq's son Abu'l-Abbas, the future Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892\u2013902), was given the command against the Zanj, and in the next year, al-Muwaffaq himself joined the campaign. In a succession of engagements in the marshes of southern Iraq, the Abbasid forces drove back the Zanj towards their capital, Mukhtara, which fell in August 883.{{sfn|Bonner|2010|pp=323\u2013324}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=153\u2013156}}\n\n===Ibn Tulun and al-Mu'tamid's attempted flight to Egypt===\n[[File:Dinar of Ahmad bin Tulun, AH 268.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Obverse and reverse of round gold coin with Arabic inscriptions|Gold dinar, minted in [[Fustat]] in 881/2, in the name of al-Mu'tamid, al-Mufawwad, and the ruler of Egypt Ahmad ibn Tulun]]\nAt the same time, al-Muwaffaq also had to contend with the ambitions of Ahmad ibn Tulun in the western provinces.
