Rhodes was responsible for discovering [[John Lydon]] and arranging his audition in the King's Road which led to him joining the Sex Pistols. He introduced [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] and [[Paul Simonon]] to [[Joe Strummer]], who, with [[Keith Levene]] then formed [[The Clash]]. Rhodes was an important force behind The Clash not only managing their business but also handling the marketing and creative direction of the band. Disagreement with the groups' direction led to his sacking by the Clash in 1979. Rhodes meantime continued with other successful signings to his label Oddball Productions and major record companies{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=78}}. In 1981 singer [[Joe Strummer]] demanded his return to the Clash or he would quit.\n\nOther groups Rhodes worked with and managed include [[The Specials]], [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], [[Subway Sect]], [[Jo Boxers]], The Lous, Black Arabs, Twenty Flight Rockers and Watts from Detroit.\n\nDuring this period Rhodes built and then operated from his Camden studio Rehearsal Rehearsals, in what became Camden Market. The area around the studio became a well known hangout for punks and contributed to the growth of Camden as a [[hip (slang)|hip]] area.\n\n===Early life===\nBernard Rhodes was raised in [[Stepney]], east London. He says he never knew his father. He was placed in a Jewish orphanage in [[South London]] where he remained until he was 15. His mother worked long hours for Huntsman's tailors in Saville Row making suits for people like [[Cary Grant]] and later [[Hawes & Curtis]] where Rhodes friend John Pearse who co-owned [[Granny Takes A Trip]] was her apprentice.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=81}}\n\nIn the early 1960s Rhodes and Pearse shared a flat at 68 Hamilton Terrace, St Johns Wood, London. [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marc Bolan]], musician [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn]], [[the Small Faces]] and [[Guy Stevens]] (who Rhodes later brought in to produce The Clash){{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=81}} were regular visitors.\n\n===Early career===\nTowards the late 1960s Rhodes won a [[Design Council]] award for a children's educational toy he designed using newly developed plastic techniques.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=82}} In the early 1970s Rhodes had a [[Retail shop|shop]] in the Antiquarius Market, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] selling his hand printed silk screen designs on shirts and T-shirts, plus a selection of rare vintage [[reggae]] records.{{Sfn|Letts|2007|p=50}}\n\nDuring this period he became re-acquainted with an old friend, [[Malcolm McLaren]] and his girlfriend [[Vivienne Westwood]] who were operating out of [[Sex (boutique)|Let It Rock]] boutique at 430 [[Kings Road]]. Finding they shared a similar philosophy, Rhodes and McLaren went into business collaborating on several T-shirts which were then sold in the shop. Westwood wanted to expand the sleeveless T-shirt clothing line and Rhodes was an ideal colleague with his silk screen printing skill and 'complex meandering discourse threw up many new ideas'.{{Sfn|Savage|1991|p=83}} The T-shirt 'You're Gonna Wake Up One Morning and Know What Side of The Bed You've Been Lying On' was created and printed by Rhodes and uses his handwriting. McLaren explained that Rhodes idea was 'to create a dialogue'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Look|last=Gorman|first=Paul|publisher=Adelita|year=2006|isbn=0-9552017-0-5|location=London|pages=137}}</ref> Rhodes has described the difference between himself and McLaren: 'Malcolm [McLaren] likes to titillate but I get down to substance'.{{Sfn|Savage|1991|p=102}}\n\n=== Sex Pistols ===\nBy 1975, SEX had become a hangout for a bunch of teenagers from whom the [[Sex Pistols]] would emerge. Rhodes took the group under his wing while McLaren was in New York looking after the [[New York Dolls]].{{Sfn|Strongman |2008|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOriginal Sex Pistols member Glen Matlock describes Rhodes contribution as making them understand the importance of being clear cut. 'He (Rhodes) had a real ability for making people decide exactly what they were trying to do.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=I was a teenage Sex Pistol|last=Matlock|first=Glen|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=1990|isbn=0-7119-1817-1|location=London|pages=32}}</ref>\n\nJohn Lydon states that he was wearing a 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt when he was spotted by Rhodes on the [[Kings Road]]. Rhodes insisted he meet McLaren, Steve Jones and Paul Cook in the local Roebuck pub that evening. After this get together, Rhodes had Lydon come back to the shop to audition for the role of singer.{{Sfn|Lydon |1993|p=75}}\n\nLydon says that Rhodes \"was important to me in so many ways...He would indicate to me where the problems with the Pistols would be in the future. He would sow a seed and then wait to see if I would pick up on it.{{Sfn|Lydon |1993|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n=== The Clash ===\nAfter his offer to co-manage Sex Pistols was rejected by McLaren, Rhodes was instrumental in [[The Clash]]'s formation in 1976. Mick Jones was wearing one of Rhodes' ''Wake Up'' T-shirts when he approached Rhodes after a Sex Pistols gig thinking he was a keyboard player. They started talking about groups and the relationship was the starting point for what would eventually become The Clash.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=60}}\n\nStrummer credits Rhodes as his mentor, stating \"He constructed The Clash and focused our energies and we repaid him by being really good at what we did\".{{Sfn|The Clash |2008 |p=88}} \nRhodes told them to write about social issues occurring at the time, i.e., the housing problems, lack of education, dead-end futures.{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=88}} Strummer said that Rhodes was the only one who understood how one should go about getting known.{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=88}}\n\n[[Paul Simonon]] stated that Rhodes \"set up the whole punk scene basically. He saw how non-musicians like myself and John (Lydon) could contribute\".{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=78}}\n\nRhodes called his friend Guy Stevens in, to produce the Polydor recordings in 1977.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=117}} The group later used Stevens to produce ''[[London Calling]]''. He also sought out [[Lee 'Scratch' Perry]] to produce the single \"Complete Control\".{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=88}}\n\nOn 25 January 1977, Rhodes signed The Clash to CBS Records with CBS Records UK chairman [[Maurice Oberstein]] who promised to allow the group to do what they wanted on record and CBS would promote it. After a couple of albums, including their first, which Rhodes helped produce with Mickey Foote, he felt the group were drifting away from their street ideals and they parted company in late 1978.\n\n=== 1979\u20131981 ===\nFrom his Rehearsal Rehearsals studio, Rhodes nurtured and managed groups [[Subway Sect]], [[The Specials]], [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], The Black Arabs and other musical projects.\n\nThe intro to The Specials' version of \"Gangsters\" begins with the line: \"Bernie Rhodes knows: don't argue!\"{{Sfn|Adams|2009}}\n\nDexys Midnight Runners' single \"Dance Stance\" was released in 1979 on the Oddball Productions label owned by Rhodes .{{Sfn|White|2005|p=205}} Rhodes later signed the group to EMI Records.\n\nThe first album by Subway Sect, ''What's the Matter Boy'', was produced by Rhodes and released by Oddball in 1980.\n\nRhodes introduced the idea of using a Burundi drum beat to McLaren{{Sfn|Vermorel|1987|p=236}} who gave it to [[Adam Ant]]. This led to the sound of ''Kings of the Wild Frontier'' (1980) by [[Adam and the Ants]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex Pistols the Inside Story|last=Vermorel|first=Fred and Judy|publisher=Omnibus|origyear=1978|year=1987|isbn=9780711-910904|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexpistolsinside00verm/page/236 236]|url=https://archive.org/details/sexpistolsinside00verm/page/236}}</ref>\n\n=== Club Left ===\nDuring the late seventies he opened Club Left in Wardour Street [[Soho]].{{Sfn|G Spot|1993|p=39}} Club Left performances included [[Dig Wayne]], Tom Cat, Lady Blue, Johnny Britton, [[Sade Adu|Sade]], [[Bananarama]], [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Slim Gaillard]]. The regular house band was Vic Godard and the Subway Sect.\n\n[[Sean McLusky]] said that Rhodes gave him a break at Club Left in 1981 and then got a deal and success for his band [[JoBoxers]], who enjoyed mainstream success on both sides of the Atlantic with their single \"[[Just Got Lucky]]\". McLusky says, \"Bernard never got the credit for things that were his. He has been the undefined force\".{{Sfn|G Spot|1993|p=39}}\n\n=== Return to the Clash ===\n\nStrummer said if Rhodes did not come back and manage the Clash he would quit.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=286}}\n\nOnce back, Rhodes decided to remix \"Magnificent 7\". A 12\" single dance remix \"Magnificent Dance\" was released on 12 April 1981. Production was credited to 'Pepe Unidos', a pseudonym for Strummer, Rhodes and Paul Simonon. {{Sfn|Punknews.org||1993}} Pepe Unidos also produced \"The Cool Out\", a re-mix of \"The Call Out\". {{Sfn|www.songfacts.com/facts/the-clash/the-cool-out}}\n\n=== Bonds NYC ===\nMick: 'Bernie came back on the scene because people thought that we'd gotten out of control and the first thing he wanted to do was book us for seven nights in New York'.{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=290}}\n\nThe residency at Bonds NYC in the first two weeks of June 1981 was organised by Rhodes on his return as manager of The Clash. Support acts included [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Bad Brains]], Texan bad boy Joe Ely, Lee Perry and [[Funkapolitan]]. Rhodes states that it was because of these Bonds NYC shows that the public became more interested in hip-hop. \"I endeavoured to get these guys on like Grandmaster Flash; not that most of the audience liked them but that led to a helluvalot\".{{Sfn|Gruen|2001|p=241}}\n\nThe record company were not behind the triple album ''[[Sandinista!]]'' recorded in Rhodes's absence{{Sfn|Gruen|2001|p=240}} but [[Kosmo Vinyl]] states that with the Bonds NYC residency, The Clash \"clawed their way back into the Premiership\".{{Sfn|Gruen|2001|p=242}}\n\n=== Jones' sacking ===\nPaul Simonon states that Rhodes was not aware Mick Jones was going to be sacked nor was he in favour of the action. (The sacking took place in 1983.) Simonon says however Jones had believed Rhodes to be responsible and did not find out otherwise until the [[Rock Hall of Fame]] induction after Joe Strummer's death. {{Sfn|Salewicz|pp=373\u2013375}}\n\nAfter sacking Jones, Strummer and Simonon held blind auditions to recruit two new guitarists. Strummer states they auditioned somewhere near 350 guitarists and found [[Nick Sheppard]] in the first batch, Vince White in the second.<ref>{{cite web|author=Len Righi |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1984-04-20/entertainment/2415279_1_joe-strummer-strummer-and-simonon-mick-jones |title=Joe Strummer tells why the Clash is carrying on |date=20 April 1984 |publisher=mcall.com |url-status=live |accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to guitarist Vince White, the working title of The Clash's last album, ''[[Cut the Crap]]'', released in 1985, was ''Out of Control''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The title was changed by Rhodes shortly before its release. Rhodes also produced the album under the name of 'Jose Unidos'.{{Sfn|CBS26601}}\n\nStrummer wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes tried to take control of arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on synthetic drum sounds and sampling, are widely derided. One writer described the album\u2019s sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\".[3] Rhodes chose the often-mocked album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. On release, Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\".[4][5] Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release.\n\nThe tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. Simonon refused from the outset to take part in any activity involving Rhodes. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for lead single \"This Is England\"; by the album's release, the band members were so discouraged that they did not turn up for the first day's shoot. Strummer moved to Spain, in part due to family issues, but also to escape the backlash.\n\nAfter being disparaged by critics upon release, Cut the Crap is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash\u2019s compilations and box sets. Some retrospective assessments have been more sympathetic or measured; critics and band biographers have found merit in Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\".\n\nStrummer described \"This is England\" as the last great Clash song and it has inspired many, including [[Shane Meadows]] who made a movie and TV show of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neil Spencer & James Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/29/popandrock |title=Why the Clash are still Rock Titans |accessdate=29 October 2006 |date=29 October 2006 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Watts ==\nIn 1990, Rhodes relocated from Los Angeles to Atlanta, Georgia where Doug Watts, the lead singer of a black metal band [[Naked Truth (band)|Naked Truth]] asked him for help. Rhodes brought in a new bass player and rehearsed the band over several months. Rhodes independently produced the album 'Green with Rage'.

Rhodes was responsible for discovering [[John Lydon]] and arranging his audition in the King's Road which led to him joining the Sex Pistols. He introduced [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] and [[Paul Simonon]] to [[Joe Strummer]], who, with [[Keith Levene]] then formed [[The Clash]]. Rhodes was an important force behind The Clash not only managing their business but also handling the marketing and creative direction of the band. Disagreement with the groups' direction led to his sacking by the Clash in 1979. Rhodes meantime continued with other successful signings to his label Oddball Productions and major record companies{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=78}}. In 1981 singer [[Joe Strummer]] demanded his return to the Clash or he would quit.\n\nOther groups Rhodes worked with and managed include [[The Specials]], [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], [[Subway Sect]], [[Jo Boxers]], The Lous, Black Arabs, Twenty Flight Rockers and Watts from Detroit.\n\nDuring this period Rhodes built and then operated from his Camden studio Rehearsal Rehearsals, in what became Camden Market. The area around the studio became a well known hangout for punks and contributed to the growth of Camden as a [[hip (slang)|hip]] area.\n\n===Early life===\nBernard Rhodes was raised in [[Stepney]], east London. He says he never knew his father. He was placed in a Jewish orphanage in [[South London]] where he remained until he was 15. His mother worked long hours for Huntsman's tailors in Saville Row making suits for people like [[Cary Grant]] and later [[Hawes & Curtis]] where Rhodes friend John Pearse who co-owned [[Granny Takes A Trip]] was her apprentice.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=81}}\n\nIn the early 1960s Rhodes and Pearse shared a flat at 68 Hamilton Terrace, St Johns Wood, London. [[Mick Jagger]], [[Marc Bolan]], musician [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn]], [[the Small Faces]] and [[Guy Stevens]] (who Rhodes later brought in to produce The Clash){{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=81}} were regular visitors.\n\n===Early career===\nTowards the late 1960s Rhodes won a [[Design Council]] award for a children's educational toy he designed using newly developed plastic techniques.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=82}} In the early 1970s Rhodes had a [[Retail shop|shop]] in the Antiquarius Market, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] selling his hand printed silk screen designs on shirts and T-shirts, plus a selection of rare vintage [[reggae]] records.{{Sfn|Letts|2007|p=50}}\n\nDuring this period he became re-acquainted with an old friend, [[Malcolm McLaren]] and his girlfriend [[Vivienne Westwood]] who were operating out of [[Sex (boutique)|Let It Rock]] boutique at 430 [[Kings Road]]. Finding they shared a similar philosophy, Rhodes and McLaren went into business collaborating on several T-shirts which were then sold in the shop. Westwood wanted to expand the sleeveless T-shirt clothing line and Rhodes was an ideal colleague with his silk screen printing skill and 'complex meandering discourse threw up many new ideas'.{{Sfn|Savage|1991|p=83}} The T-shirt 'You're Gonna Wake Up One Morning and Know What Side of The Bed You've Been Lying On' was created and printed by Rhodes and uses his handwriting. McLaren explained that Rhodes idea was 'to create a dialogue'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Look|last=Gorman|first=Paul|publisher=Adelita|year=2006|isbn=0-9552017-0-5|location=London|pages=137}}</ref> Rhodes has described the difference between himself and McLaren: 'Malcolm [McLaren] likes to titillate but I get down to substance'.{{Sfn|Savage|1991|p=102}}\n\n=== Sex Pistols ===\nBy 1975, SEX had become a hangout for a bunch of teenagers from whom the [[Sex Pistols]] would emerge. Rhodes took the group under his wing while McLaren was in New York looking after the [[New York Dolls]].{{Sfn|Strongman |2008|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nOriginal Sex Pistols member Glen Matlock describes Rhodes contribution as making them understand the importance of being clear cut. 'He (Rhodes) had a real ability for making people decide exactly what they were trying to do.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=I was a teenage Sex Pistol|last=Matlock|first=Glen|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=1990|isbn=0-7119-1817-1|location=London|pages=32}}</ref>\n\nJohn Lydon states that he was wearing a 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt when he was spotted by Rhodes on the [[Kings Road]]. Rhodes insisted he meet McLaren, Steve Jones and Paul Cook in the local Roebuck pub that evening. After this get together, Rhodes had Lydon come back to the shop to audition for the role of singer.{{Sfn|Lydon |1993|p=75}}\n\nLydon says that Rhodes \"was important to me in so many ways...He would indicate to me where the problems with the Pistols would be in the future. He would sow a seed and then wait to see if I would pick up on it.{{Sfn|Lydon |1993|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n=== The Clash ===\nAfter his offer to co-manage Sex Pistols was rejected by McLaren, Rhodes was instrumental in [[The Clash]]'s formation in 1976. Mick Jones was wearing one of Rhodes' ''Wake Up'' T-shirts when he approached Rhodes after a Sex Pistols gig thinking he was a keyboard player. They started talking about groups and the relationship was the starting point for what would eventually become The Clash.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=60}}\n\nStrummer credits Rhodes as his mentor, stating \"He constructed The Clash and focused our energies and we repaid him by being really good at what we did\".{{Sfn|The Clash |2008 |p=88}} \nRhodes told them to write about social issues occurring at the time, i.e., the housing problems, lack of education, dead-end futures.{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=88}} Strummer said that Rhodes was the only one who understood how one should go about getting known.{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=88}}\n\n[[Paul Simonon]] stated that Rhodes \"set up the whole punk scene basically. He saw how non-musicians like myself and John (Lydon) could contribute\".{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=78}}\n\nRhodes called his friend Guy Stevens in, to produce the Polydor recordings in 1977.{{Sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=117}} The group later used Stevens to produce ''[[London Calling]]''. He also sought out [[Lee 'Scratch' Perry]] to produce the single \"Complete Control\".{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=88}}\n\nOn 25 January 1977, Rhodes signed The Clash to CBS Records with CBS Records UK chairman [[Maurice Oberstein]] who promised to allow the group to do what they wanted on record and CBS would promote it. After a couple of albums, including their first, which Rhodes helped produce with Mickey Foote, he felt the group were drifting away from their street ideals and they parted company in late 1978.\n\n=== 1979\u20131981 ===\nFrom his Rehearsal Rehearsals studio, Rhodes nurtured and managed groups [[Subway Sect]], [[The Specials]], [[Dexys Midnight Runners]], The Black Arabs and other musical projects.\n\nThe intro to The Specials' version of \"Gangsters\" begins with the line: \"Bernie Rhodes knows: don't argue!\"{{Sfn|Adams|2009}}\n\nDexys Midnight Runners' single \"Dance Stance\" was released in 1979 on the Oddball Productions label owned by Rhodes .{{Sfn|White|2005|p=205}} Rhodes later signed the group to EMI Records.\n\nThe first album by Subway Sect, ''What's the Matter Boy'', was produced by Rhodes and released by Oddball in 1980.\n\nRhodes introduced the idea of using a Burundi drum beat to McLaren{{Sfn|Vermorel|1987|p=236}} who gave it to [[Adam Ant]]. This led to the sound of ''Kings of the Wild Frontier'' (1980) by [[Adam and the Ants]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex Pistols the Inside Story|last=Vermorel|first=Fred and Judy|publisher=Omnibus|origyear=1978|year=1987|isbn=9780711-910904|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexpistolsinside00verm/page/236 236]|url=https://archive.org/details/sexpistolsinside00verm/page/236}}</ref>\n\n=== Club Left ===\nDuring the late seventies he opened Club Left in Wardour Street [[Soho]].{{Sfn|G Spot|1993|p=39}} Club Left performances included [[Dig Wayne]], Tom Cat, Lady Blue, Johnny Britton, [[Sade Adu|Sade]], [[Bananarama]], [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Slim Gaillard]].

McLusky says, \"Bernard never got the credit for things that were his.

A 12\" single dance remix \"Magnificent Dance\" was released on 12 April 1981. Production was credited to 'Pepe Unidos', a pseudonym for Strummer, Rhodes and Paul Simonon. {{Sfn|Punknews.org||1993}} Pepe Unidos also produced \"The Cool Out\", a re-mix of \"The Call Out\". {{Sfn|www.songfacts.com/facts/the-clash/the-cool-out}}\n\n=== Bonds NYC ===\nMick: 'Bernie came back on the scene because people thought that we'd gotten out of control and the first thing he wanted to do was book us for seven nights in New York'.{{Sfn|The Clash|2008|p=290}}\n\nThe residency at Bonds NYC in the first two weeks of June 1981 was organised by Rhodes on his return as manager of The Clash. Support acts included [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Bad Brains]], Texan bad boy Joe Ely, Lee Perry and [[Funkapolitan]]. Rhodes states that it was because of these Bonds NYC shows that the public became more interested in hip-hop. \"I endeavoured to get these guys on like Grandmaster Flash; not that most of the audience liked them but that led to a helluvalot\".{{Sfn|Gruen|2001|p=241}}\n\nThe record company were not behind the triple album ''[[Sandinista!]]'' recorded in Rhodes's absence{{Sfn|Gruen|2001|p=240}} but [[Kosmo Vinyl]] states that with the Bonds NYC residency, The Clash \"clawed their way back into the Premiership\".{{Sfn|Gruen|2001|p=242}}\n\n=== Jones' sacking ===\nPaul Simonon states that Rhodes was not aware Mick Jones was going to be sacked nor was he in favour of the action. (The sacking took place in 1983.) Simonon says however Jones had believed Rhodes to be responsible and did not find out otherwise until the [[Rock Hall of Fame]] induction after Joe Strummer's death. {{Sfn|Salewicz|pp=373\u2013375}}\n\nAfter sacking Jones, Strummer and Simonon held blind auditions to recruit two new guitarists. Strummer states they auditioned somewhere near 350 guitarists and found Nick Shephard in the first batch, Vince White in the second.<ref>{{cite web|author=Len Righi |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1984-04-20/entertainment/2415279_1_joe-strummer-strummer-and-simonon-mick-jones |title=Joe Strummer tells why the Clash is carrying on |date=20 April 1984 |publisher=mcall.com |url-status=live |accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to guitarist Vince White, the working title of The Clash's last album, ''[[Cut the Crap]]'', released in 1985, was ''Out of Control''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The title was changed by Rhodes shortly before its release. Rhodes also produced the album under the name of 'Jose Unidos'.{{Sfn|CBS26601}}\n\nStrummer wrote most of the songs. During production, Rhodes tried to take control of arrangements, track sequencing and the final mix. His production choices, which rely heavily on synthetic drum sounds and sampling, are widely derided. One writer described the album\u2019s sound as brash and seemingly \"designed to sound hip and modern\u2014'80s style!\".[3] Rhodes chose the often-mocked album title, taken from a line in the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. On release, Cut the Crap was maligned in the UK music press as \"one of the most disastrous [albums] ever released by a major artist\".[4][5] Strummer disowned the album and dissolved the Clash within weeks of its release.\n\nThe tension between Rhodes and Strummer left other band members disillusioned. Simonon refused from the outset to take part in any activity involving Rhodes. White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for lead single \"This Is England\"; by the album's release, the band members were so discouraged that they did not turn up for the first day's shoot. Strummer moved to Spain, in part due to family issues, but also to escape the backlash.\n\nAfter being disparaged by critics upon release, Cut the Crap is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash\u2019s compilations and box sets. Some retrospective assessments have been more sympathetic or measured; critics and band biographers have found merit in Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\".\n\nStrummer described \"This is England\" as the last great Clash song and it has inspired many, including [[Shane Meadows]] who made a movie and TV show of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neil Spencer & James Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/oct/29/popandrock |title=Why the Clash are still Rock Titans |accessdate=29 October 2006 |date=29 October 2006 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Watts ==\nIn 1990, Rhodes relocated from Los Angeles to Atlanta, Georgia where Doug Watts, the lead singer of a black metal band [[Naked Truth (band)|Naked Truth]] asked him for help. Rhodes brought in a new bass player and rehearsed the band over several months. Rhodes independently produced the album 'Green with Rage'. He then signed the band to Sony Records. {{Sfn|RiffRaff March 1992}}\n\n==Recent==\n\nOn 27 May 2016, The British Library invited Rhodes to give a talk entitled ''Me, Punk and the World'' as part of its ''Punk 1976-78'' exhibit<ref>{{cite web |title=Me, Punk and the World: Bernard Rhodes in Conversation |url=https://www.bl.uk/events/me-punk-and-the-world-bernard-rhodes-in-conversation |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n;Books\n{{Refbegin}}<!--REFBEGIN: CITED Books in alphabetical order-->\n* {{Cite book |last=Clash |first=The |title=The Clash |year=2008 |publisher=[[Atlantic Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84354-788-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=harv |last1=Coon |first1=Caroline |authorlink1=Caroline Coon |title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion |url=http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/Clash%20gigography/1976%20DATES.html |accessdate=19 September 2011 |year=1977 |publisher=Hawthorn |location=London |isbn=0-8015-6129-9 |oclc=79262599}}\n* {{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Pat |title=Passion Is a Fashion: The Real Story of The Clash |origyear=2004 |edition=4th |year=2005 |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |location=London |isbn=1-84513-113-4 |oclc=61177239 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Gruen |first=Bob |title=The Clash Photographs by Bob Gruen |year=2001 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |isbn=1-903399-34-3 |ref=Harv}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Gray |first=Marcus |title=The Clash: Return of the Last Gang in Town |origyear=1995 |edition=5th revised |year=2005 |publisher=Helter Skelter |location=London |isbn=1-905139-10-1 |oclc=60668626}}\n* {{cite book |last=Letts |first=Don |title=Culture Clash: Dread Meets Punk Rockers |year=2007 |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-946719-89-1 |ref=Harv |url=https://archive.org/details/cultureclashdrea00lett }}\n* {{cite book |last=Lydon |first=John |title=Rotten:No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs |year=1993 |publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]] |location=London |isbn=0-340-63528-2 |ref=Harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Savage |first=Jon |title=England's Dreaming: Sex Pistols and Punk Rock |origyear=1991 |edition=2nd |year=2001 |publisher=[[Faber & Faber]] |location=London |isbn=978-0571227204 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Strongman |first=Phil |title=Pretty Vacant: A History of UK Punk |origyear=2007 |edition=US |year=2008 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-1-55652-752-4 |oclc=173299117 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Topping |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Topping |title=The Complete Clash |origyear=2003 |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn |location=Richmond |isbn=1-903111-70-6 |oclc=63129186}}\n* {{cite book |last=Vermorel |first=Fred & Judy |title=Sex Pistols The Inside Story |origyear=1978 |edition=3rd |year=1987 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |location=London |isbn=9780711-910904 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/sexpistolsinside00verm }}\n* {{cite book |last=Westwood & Kelly |first=Vivienne & Ian |title=Vivienne Westwood |year=2014 |publisher=[[Picador]] |location=London |isbn=9781-44-7254126 |ref=harv}}\n<!--REFEND-->\n{{Refend}}\n\n;Films and documentaries\n{{Refbegin|30em}}<!--REFBEGIN: CITED Films and documentaries in alphabetical order-->\n* {{cite video |ref={{sfnRef|Westway 2001}} |people=[[Don Letts|Letts Don]];

The show consists of five different rounds. The first four rounds switch between different themes such as \"Roses Are Red\", \"Alexander Hamilton\", \"Keep it Clean\", \"In Just Four Words\", \"Make a Haiku\", \"Are You Funnier Than a YouTuber?\", and others. After the question is asked, users submit their answers in the chat. After five answers are chosen by Jack, viewers vote for their favorite answer. The person who gets the most votes will be able to compete in the final round. In the final round, only the winners from the first four rounds can submit answers, however, viewers can still vote for their favorite answer.\n\nOnce the viewers have voted, the winner of Round Five wins the episode. The winner receives free merchandise. The streams are uploaded to his second channel, jackisanerd, and highlights from the episode are uploaded to his main channel.\n\nHis most recent episode of YIAY Live on Twitch, episode 18, occurred on November 7, 2018, after being twice delayed.

A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection.  The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars.  The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required. Evidence for the treatment of these complications is scarce.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Treating BCG-induced disease in children|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 23440826|pages = CD008300|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008300.pub2|first = Carlos A.|last = Cuello-Garc\u00eda|first2 = Giordano|last2 = P\u00e9rez-Gaxiola|first3 = Carlos|last3 = Jim\u00e9nez Guti\u00e9rrez|pmc = 6532703}}</ref>\n\nUncommonly, breast and gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization. This scar must be distinguished from that of [[smallpox vaccination]], which it may resemble.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nBCG immunization generally causes some pain and scarring at the site of injection.  The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars.  The insertion of deltoid is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given intradermally. If given subcutaneously, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional lymph nodes, causing either suppurative and nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. Conservative management is usually adequate for nonsuppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need needle aspiration. For nonresolving suppuration, surgical excision may be required.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dr. R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

Three years later, Loughrey founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA) and hosted the company's first auction on October 10, 1992. The inaugural auction featured 136 lots of Modern design, including works by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Peter Max]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. \n\nIn 1993, Loughrey closed his gallery and landed in [[London]] to earn a degree in contemporary works of art through the [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]. As a student, he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark [[Man Ray]] auction at [[Sotheby's]], London.\n\nIn 1995, Loughrey married Shannon Carragher and, together, they re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. The Loughreys conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss]] 'Samitaur' building in Culver City, California, on May 18, 1996. Their following auction was held five months later on October 27, 1996, at the IM Chait Gallery in [[Beverly Hills]].\n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of Modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]], realized $129,000.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nAfter achieving the world record for an Eames design in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity was chosen by John & Marilyn Neuhart to auction works from their private collection in July 2000 \u2013 the first ever single-owner auction dedicated to the works of Charles and Ray Eames. On offer were custom designs, sculptures, photographs, drawings, and ephemera by the Eameses curated by the Neuharts, who worked in the Eames Office and authored ''Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames''. Also included was a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes \u2013 many of which are in permanent collections in public institutions. \n\nAcknowledging LAMA\u2019s swift ascent, Loughrey was included that year in ''Art & Auction'''s Power Issue.\n\nIn 2002, during the Loughreys\u2019 tenure directing [[Butterfield and Butterfield]]'s 20th Century Decorative Arts and Design department,  [[Playboy]] Enterprises selected Loughrey to conduct the first-ever auction of items from the magazine's archives, including fine art, photography, sculpture, drawings, and ephemera. That year, LAMA also organized the first auction dedicated to the collection of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd.\n\nIn 2003, Peter Loughrey joined [[PBS]]\u2019s [[Antiques Roadshow]] as an appraiser and continued to be featured on the program today until his passing in 2020. \n\nLAMA achieved two more world auction records in 2004, when works by [[George Nakashima]] sold for more than $100,000 \u2014 Nakashima remains a consistently featured LAMA artist today. The same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Loughrey to co-curate ''Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration''. Works by Italian designer, architect and artist Ponti continue to be regularly presented at LAMA sales.\n\nLoughrey also worked with ACME to co-curate another show in 2005, ''Dutch Design''. In May of that year, LAMA was the exclusive auctioneer of the entire contents of the [[Paul Laszlo]]-designed Hudspeth Residence. This was the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at auction at one time.\n\nLAMA established a new world record price for ''Marilyn (#28)'' by [[Andy Warhol]] at its June 3, 2007 Modern Art & Design Auction, where the work realized $144,000. Shortly after, [[Judy Chicago]]\u2019s ''Car Hood'' realized $288,000. \n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale, auctioning the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!, and, in October, the Loughreys left their West Hollywood location for LAMA\u2019s current showroom in Van Nuys, California. The space was formerly home to Stan Winston Studio and features a skylight added to accommodate the construction of the tyrannosaurus Rex for the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.\n\n===2010 to 2020===\nLAMA celebrated its 25th anniversary with its October 22, 2017 Modern Art & Design Auction; the Top Lot was [[Roy Lichtenstein]]\u2019s ''Reverie'', which sold for $175,000. Other top lots included works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Marchel Duchamp]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nLAMA\u2019s October 3, 2008 Modern Art & Design Auction saw the highest sale total in its history, with $5.17 million in sales achieving 125% over the low estimate. \n\nIn October 2019, LAMA introduced the LAMA app, holding their first online-only auction and welcoming web-based bidding on live auction lots. \n\nOn March 2020, Peter Loughrey passed away at from cancer in Los Angeles.

The auction house also acquired more than 500 Eames leg splints from an army surplus, which they sold at the gift shops at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles.\n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. It was featured in Wendy Moonan\u2019s [[New York Times]] article on the antiques market, in which she stated, \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> In February of that year, LAMA launched its website, bringing broader visibility to the company. To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was invited by Echoes Magazine to interview [[Pierre Koenig]], the architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]].\n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the Modern art and design markets. \u201cModern Monthly\u201d auctions were held with the average lot selling for less than $500 in a bid to reach young collectors through accessible prices. LAMA was commissioned by [[ARCO]] (Atlantic Ritchfield Corporation) to liquidate the company's corporate fine art collection \u2014 the first major fine art commission for the auction house. The same year, LAMA achieved a world record for any design by Charles Eames when the \u201cConversation\u201d prototype, a 1941 collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]], realized $129,000.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nAfter achieving the world record for an Eames design in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity was chosen by John & Marilyn Neuhart to auction works from their private collection in July 2000 \u2013 the first ever single-owner auction dedicated to the works of Charles and Ray Eames. On offer were custom designs, sculptures, photographs, drawings, and ephemera by the Eameses curated by the Neuharts, who worked in the Eames Office and authored ''Eames Design: The Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames''. Also included was a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes \u2013 many of which are in permanent collections in public institutions. \n\nAcknowledging LAMA\u2019s swift ascent, Loughrey was included that year in ''Art & Auction'''s Power Issue.\n\nIn 2002, during the Loughreys\u2019 tenure directing [[Butterfield and Butterfield]]'s 20th Century Decorative Arts and Design department,  [[Playboy]] Enterprises selected Loughrey to conduct the first-ever auction of items from the magazine's archives, including fine art, photography, sculpture, drawings, and ephemera. That year, LAMA also organized the first auction dedicated to the collection of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd.\n\nIn 2003, Peter Loughrey joined [[PBS]]\u2019s [[Antiques Roadshow]] as an appraiser and continued to be featured on the program today until his passing in 2020. \n\nLAMA achieved two more world auction records in 2004, when works by [[George Nakashima]] sold for more than $100,000 \u2014 Nakashima remains a consistently featured LAMA artist today. The same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Loughrey to co-curate ''Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration''. Works by Italian designer, architect and artist Ponti continue to be regularly presented at LAMA sales.\n\nLoughrey also worked with ACME to co-curate another show in 2005, ''Dutch Design''. In May of that year, LAMA was the exclusive auctioneer of the entire contents of the [[Paul Laszlo]]-designed Hudspeth Residence. This was the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at auction at one time.\n\nLAMA established a new world record price for ''Marilyn (#28)'' by [[Andy Warhol]] at its June 3, 2007 Modern Art & Design Auction, where the work realized $144,000. Shortly after, [[Judy Chicago]]\u2019s ''Car Hood'' realized $288,000. \n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale, auctioning the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!, and, in October, the Loughreys left their West Hollywood location for LAMA\u2019s current showroom in Van Nuys, California. The space was formerly home to Stan Winston Studio and features a skylight added to accommodate the construction of the tyrannosaurus Rex for the film ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.\n\n===2010 to 2020===\nLAMA celebrated its 25th anniversary with its October 22, 2017 Modern Art & Design Auction; the Top Lot was [[Roy Lichtenstein]]\u2019s ''Reverie'', which sold for $175,000. Other top lots included works by [[Paul Klee]], [[Marchel Duchamp]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nLAMA\u2019s October 3, 2008 Modern Art & Design Auction saw the highest sale total in its history, with $5.17 million in sales achieving 125% over the low estimate. \n\nIn October 2019, LAMA introduced the LAMA app, holding their first online-only auction and welcoming web-based bidding on live auction lots. \n\nOn March 2020, Peter Loughrey passed away at from cancer in Los Angeles. Benedikt Taschen told David Keeps for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that Loughrey \u201cknew more about the fabric of California modernism than anyone.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Keeps |first1=David |title=My 'Antiques Roadshow' moment with auctioneer Peter Loughrey, champion of California modernism |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-03-23/peter-loughrey-antiques-roadshow-expert-los-angeles-modern-auctions |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Auctions==\n\n'''May 18, 1996''': This Modern Art & Design Auction featured works exclusively offered through LAMA from Richard Neutra\u2019s V.D.L.
