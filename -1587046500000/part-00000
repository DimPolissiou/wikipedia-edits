Its seat is located in the [[urban areas of Sweden|town]] of [[Nykvarn]].\n\nNykvarn is a young municipality, and is the result of the splitting of [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Municipality]] in 1999. Nykvarn can be regarded as a totally new municipality, because there was never before an entity with that territory or that name.\n\nThe municipality has a significant population increase in the summer thanks to tourism.\n\nNykvarn is located between the two [[stad (Sweden)|cities]] [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] and [[Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s]], and many citizens of Nykvarn work in either.\n\nArcheological finds show the area to have been inhabited for about 5,000 years, similar to its neighbouring municipalities around [[M\u00e4laren|Lake M\u00e4laren]].\n\nBesides graves from the [[Stone Age]], there is also an interesting [[runestone]] that can be visited that is listed in the [[Rundata]] catalog as [[S\u00f6dermanland Runic Inscription 338|S\u00f6 338]]. It currently resides in the Turinge church, a church that has a history dating back to around the year 1100. This runestone has a very long inscription.\n\nA newer sight is the [[Taxinge-N\u00e4sby Castle]], which was begun sometime in or before the 14th century, by Bo Jonsson Grip. The castle has its current facade in the [[empire (style)|empire]] style from 1813. Many celebrities have during the centuries visited or stayed at the castle, including [[Carl Michael Bellman]] in the 18th century and [[August Strindberg]] in the 19th century.\n\n==Demography==\n===Population development===\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Population development in Nykvarn Municipality 2000\u20132017\n| label_type  = Year\n| data_type   = Population\n| bar_width   = 35\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 30000\n| label1   = 2000\n| data1    = 8052\n| label2   = 2005\n| data2    = 8354\n| label3   = 2010\n| data3    = 9331\n| label4   = 2015\n| data4    = 10192\n| label5   = 2017\n| data5    = 10660\n| caption     = Source: [http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101A/BefolkningNy/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=f5790986-ce9d-4cdc-9658-fbc9c700b7ef=1 SCB - Folkm\u00e4ngd efter region och \u00e5r].\n}}\n\n===Residents with a foreign background ===\nOn the 31st of December 2017 the number of people with a [[:sv:utl\u00e4ndsk bakgrund|foreign background]] (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 1&nbsp;821, or 17.08% of the population (10&nbsp;660 on the 31st of December 2017).

Its seat is located in the [[urban areas of Sweden|town]] of [[Nykvarn]].\n\nNykvarn is a young municipality, and is the result of the splitting of [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Municipality]] in 1999. Nykvarn can be regarded as a totally new municipality, because there was never before an entity with that territory or that name.\n\nThe municipality has a significant population increase in the summer thanks to tourism.\n\nNykvarn is located between the two [[stad (Sweden)|cities]] [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] and [[Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s]], and many citizens of Nykvarn work in either.\n\nArcheological finds show the area to have been inhabited for about 5,000 years, similar to its neighbouring municipalities around [[M\u00e4laren|Lake M\u00e4laren]].\n\nBesides graves from the [[Stone Age]], there is also an interesting [[runestone]] that can be visited that is listed in the [[Rundata]] catalog as [[S\u00f6dermanland Runic Inscription 338|S\u00f6 338]]. It currently resides in the Turinge church, a church that has a history dating back to around the year 1100. This runestone has a very long inscription.\n\nA newer sight is the [[Taxinge-N\u00e4sby Castle]], which was begun sometime in or before the 14th century, by Bo Jonsson Grip. The castle has its current facade in the [[empire (style)|empire]] style from 1813. Many celebrities have during the centuries visited or stayed at the castle, including [[Carl Michael Bellman]] in the 18th century and [[August Strindberg]] in the 19th century.\n\n==Demography==\n===Population development===\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = Population development in Nykvarn Municipality 2000\u20132017\n| label_type  = Year\n| data_type   = Population\n| bar_width   = 35\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 30000\n| label1   = 2000\n| data1    = 8052\n| label2   = 2005\n| data2    = 8354\n| label3   = 2010\n| data3    = 9331\n| label4   = 2015\n| data4    = 10192\n| label5   = 2017\n| data5    = 10660\n| caption     = Source: [http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101A/BefolkningNy/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=f5790986-ce9d-4cdc-9658-fbc9c700b7ef=1 SCB - Folkm\u00e4ngd efter region och \u00e5r].\n}}\n\n===Residents with a foreign background ===\nOn the 31st of December 2017 the number of people with a [[:sv:utl\u00e4ndsk bakgrund|foreign background]] (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 1&nbsp;821, or 17.08% of the population (10&nbsp;660 on the 31st of December 2017).

Their album unexpectedly reaped millions in profits for [[Decca Records]], causing some resentment on the part of the tenors who officially received no royalty payments.

Domingo responded to critics in a 1998 interview: \"The purists, they say this is not opera. Of course it's not opera, it doesn't pretend to be an opera. It's a concert in which we sing some opera, we sing some songs, we do some zarzuela, then we do a medley of songs\u2026 We respect very much when people criticise it. That's fine.

It found that they had conspired not to advertise or discount the albums of the Rome concert (released by [[PolyGram]], later taken over by Vivendi) and of the Los Angeles concert (released by Warner Bros.) in order to protect sales of the jointly released album of the 1998 Paris concert.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe Three Tenors also encountered trouble with the German government. The group lost a court case{{when|date=December 2018}} over whether they legally had to pay the lower classical music royalty payment rates under Germany law or higher fees reserved for popular music. In addition, the German government accused the tenors of owing large back-taxes. Their concert organizer and promoter, Matthias Hoffmann, who was in charge of their taxes at the time, was sentenced to jail time for his role in the alleged tax evasion.<ref>Breslin 2004, pp. 224s\u201325s</ref>\n\n==Imitations==\nThe success of The Three Tenors formula led to various imitations, such as the [[Irish Tenors]], Tenor Australis, [[The Canadian Tenors]], the [[Ten Tenors]], Three Tenors and a Soprano, the Three Sopranos, Three Mo' Tenors, Les Contre-T\u00e9nors ([[Andreas Scholl]], [[Dominique Visse]], [[Pascal Bertin]]), the 2012 \"China's Three Tenors\" tour ([[Wei Song]], [[Dai Yuqiang]], and [[Warren Mok]]), The 3 Chinese Tenors (Australia), [[The Nordic Tenors]] (Scandinavia), [[Il Divo]] and Yiddish and Canadian Anglican trios of religious singers both called the Three Cantors. In 2000, [[Joe Mantegna]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Danny Aiello]] starred in the motion picture comedy ''[[Off Key|OFF-KEY]]'', loosely inspired by the Three Tenors. [[Stephin Merritt]], [[Dudley Klute]], and [[LD Beghtol]] have acted occasionally under the name ''The Three Terrors''.

Another satirical ''Three Terrors'', produced in June 2010, by [[Latma]] features singers who resemble [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] and [[Bashar Assad]] singing joyfully about using terrorism to conquer the world \"from Tennessee to Teheran.\"<ref>CBN News: [http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/06/21/the-three-terrors.aspx The Three Terrors.] 21 June 2010.</ref> Famous Azerbaijani [[KVN]] team [[Parni iz Baku]] made a sketch on Three Tenors eventually winning the Champions of the \"Tournament of Ten\" in 2000 and being praised for their voice and imitations.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2019}}\n*Throughout the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Doll (Seinfeld)|The Doll]]\", [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]] is repeatedly referred to as \"the other guy\", while the names of Domingo and Pavarotti are easily recalled. In the same episode, Elaine refers to him as an \"Italian opera star\", which is incorrect, both Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras are from Spain. \n*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Homer of Seville]]\", Homer becomes an opera star and gives advice to Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, while referring to him as his \"third favorite\" of the Three Tenors. \n*The ''[[Animaniacs]]'' cartoon ''Three Tenors and You're Out'' featured the trio performing at Dodger Stadium. \n*The Canadian [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' parodied The Three Tenors in a sketch. \n*In the ''[[Frasier]]'' episode \"The Perfect Guy\" Frasier attempts to impress Dr. Clint Webber by referring to an old friendship he had with Carreras but it backfires when Clint reveals Carreras is his godfather. \n*In the original Japanese version of the [[anime]] series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' the main antagonists, the three emperors of Yliaster, are called Pl\u00e1cido, Luciano and Jos\u00e9 in reference to The Three Tenors.

Their album unexpectedly reaped millions in profits for [[Decca Records]], causing some resentment on the part of the tenors who officially received no royalty payments. As reported in the press, Domingo suspected that the record company paid Pavarotti on the side, in order to keep one of their top contracted artists content.<ref name=NYT /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Breslin|first1=Herbert|title=The King & I|date=2004|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-385-50972-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingi000herb/page/216 216\u201318]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/kingi000herb/page/216}}</ref> Pavarotti denied this, insisting: \"We got nothing.\"<ref name=NYT /> Years later his former agent and manager [[Herbert Breslin]] wrote that Pavarotti had indeed secretly received $1.5 million that the other two tenors, who were not under contract to Decca, did not receive.<ref>Breslin 2004, p. 218.</ref> For subsequent concerts and recordings, the singers were much more careful in assuring financially advantageous contractual terms for themselves.<ref>Breslin 2004, pp. 218\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Criticism===\nThe Three Tenors phenomenon was applauded by many for introducing opera to a wider audience, but some opera purists rebuked them. Domingo responded to critics in a 1998 interview: \"The purists, they say this is not opera. Of course it's not opera, it doesn't pretend to be an opera. It's a concert in which we sing some opera, we sing some songs, we do some zarzuela, then we do a medley of songs\u2026 We respect very much when people criticise it. That's fine.

It found that they had conspired not to advertise or discount the albums of the Rome concert (released by [[PolyGram]], later taken over by Vivendi) and of the Los Angeles concert (released by Warner Bros.) in order to protect sales of the jointly released album of the 1998 Paris concert.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe Three Tenors also encountered trouble with the German government. The group lost a court case{{when|date=December 2018}} over whether they legally had to pay the lower classical music royalty payment rates under Germany law or higher fees reserved for popular music. In addition, the German government accused the tenors of owing large back-taxes. Their concert organizer and promoter, Matthias Hoffmann, who was in charge of their taxes at the time, was sentenced to jail time for his role in the alleged tax evasion.<ref>Breslin 2004, pp. 224s\u201325s</ref>\n\n==Imitations==\nThe success of The Three Tenors formula led to various imitations, such as the [[Irish Tenors]], Tenor Australis, [[The Canadian Tenors]], the [[Ten Tenors]], Three Tenors and a Soprano, the Three Sopranos, Three Mo' Tenors, Les Contre-T\u00e9nors ([[Andreas Scholl]], [[Dominique Visse]], [[Pascal Bertin]]), the 2012 \"China's Three Tenors\" tour ([[Wei Song]], [[Dai Yuqiang]], and [[Warren Mok]]), The 3 Chinese Tenors (Australia), [[The Nordic Tenors]] (Scandinavia), [[Il Divo]] and Yiddish and Canadian Anglican trios of religious singers both called the Three Cantors. In 2000, [[Joe Mantegna]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Danny Aiello]] starred in the motion picture comedy ''[[Off Key|OFF-KEY]]'', loosely inspired by the Three Tenors. [[Stephin Merritt]], [[Dudley Klute]], and [[LD Beghtol]] have acted occasionally under the name ''The Three Terrors''. The Brazilian [[samba]] singers [[Moreira da Silva]], [[Bezerra da Silva|Bezerra]] and Dicr\u00f3 produced in 1995 the album \"Bezerra, Moreira e Dicr\u00f3 \u2013 Os 3 Malandros in Concert\", portraying a satirical imitation as the three [[Malandragem|\"malandros\"]], Portuguese [[slang]] for bohemian rascals. Another satirical ''Three Terrors'', produced in June 2010, by [[Latma]] features singers who resemble [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] and [[Bashar Assad]] singing joyfully about using terrorism to conquer the world \"from Tennessee to Teheran.\"<ref>CBN News: [http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/06/21/the-three-terrors.aspx The Three Terrors.] 21 June 2010.</ref> Famous Azerbaijani [[KVN]] team [[Parni iz Baku]] made a sketch on Three Tenors eventually winning the Champions of the \"Tournament of Ten\" in 2000 and being praised for their voice and imitations.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2019}}\n*Throughout the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode \"[[The Doll (Seinfeld)|The Doll]]\", [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]] is repeatedly referred to as \"the other guy\", while the names of Domingo and Pavarotti are easily recalled. In the same episode, Elaine refers to him as an \"Italian opera star\", which is incorrect, both Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras are from Spain. \n*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Homer of Seville]]\", Homer becomes an opera star and gives advice to Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, while referring to him as his \"third favorite\" of the Three Tenors. \n*The ''[[Animaniacs]]'' cartoon ''Three Tenors and You're Out'' featured the trio performing at Dodger Stadium. \n*The Canadian [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' parodied The Three Tenors in a sketch. \n*In the ''[[Frasier]]'' episode \"The Perfect Guy\" Frasier attempts to impress Dr. Clint Webber by referring to an old friendship he had with Carreras but it backfires when Clint reveals Carreras is his godfather. \n*In the original Japanese version of the [[anime]] series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' the main antagonists, the three emperors of Yliaster, are called Pl\u00e1cido, Luciano and Jos\u00e9 in reference to The Three Tenors. The trio was also featured on the MTV animated show ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', in a match against [[The Three Stooges]]. \n*In the ''[[Friends]]'' Season 4 episode [[Friends (season 4)|\"The One
