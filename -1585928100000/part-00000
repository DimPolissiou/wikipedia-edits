with a population of around 2.5 million.\n\nKathmandu Valley is growing at 4 percent per year according to World Bank in 2010, one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in South Asia, and the first region in Nepal to face the unprecedented challenges of rapid urbanization and modernization at a metropolitan scale.<ref>{{Cite

\n\nKathmandu, also known as the city of temples, with one of the oldest Pagodas known as Pashupatinath Temple, stands at an elevation of approximately {{convert|1400|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley in central Nepal. The valley is historically termed as \"Nepal Mandala\" and has been the home of [[Newar people]], a cosmopolitan urban civilization in the [[Himalayas]] foothills. The city was the royal capital of the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] and hosts palaces, mansions and gardens of the Nepalese aristocracy. It has been home to the headquarters of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[SAARC]]) since 1985. Today, it is the seat of government of the Nepalese republic established in 2008 and is part of the [[Bagmati Pradesh|Bagmati province]].\n\nKathmandu is and has been for many years the centre of Nepal's [[History of Nepal|history]], [[Newa art|art]], [[Culture of Nepal|culture]], and [[Economy of Nepal|economy]]. It has a multi-ethnic population within a [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] majority. It is also the home of the [[Newars]]. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu.\n\n[[Tourism]] is an important part of the economy. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top ten upcoming travel destinations in the world by [[TripAdvisor]], and ranked first in Asia. The city is the gateway to the Nepalese Himalayas and home to several [[World Heritage site|world heritage sites]]: [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Durbar Square]], [[Swayambhunath]], [[Boudhanath]] and [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]]. \n\nHistoric areas of Kathmandu were severely damaged by a [[2015 Nepal earthquake|7.8 magnitude earthquake]] on 25 April 2015. Some of the buildings have been restored and some are in the process of reconstruction until now.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nIndigenous [[Newar people|Newari]] term for Kathmandu valley is ''Yei''. The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] name ''Kathmandu'' comes from [[Kasthamandap]], which stood in [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Durbar Square]]. In [[Sanskrit]], ''Kastha'' ({{lang-sa|\u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920}}) means \"Wood\" and ''Ma\u1e47\u1e0dapa'' ({{lang-sa|\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0921\u092a}}) means \"Pavilion\". This public pavilion, also known as ''Maru Satta'' in [[Newar language]], was rebuilt in 1596 by Biseth in the period of King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The three-story structure was made entirely of wood and used no iron nails nor supports. According to legend, all the timber used to build the [[pagoda]] was obtained from a single tree.<ref name=introd>{{cite web |url = http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=1&pr_id=1 |title = Introduction |accessdate = 12 December 2009 |publisher = Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal }}</ref> The structure collapsed during a major earthquake on 25 April 2015.\n\nThe [[colophon (publishing)|colophons]] of ancient manuscripts, dated as late as the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as ''K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhama\u1e47\u1e0dap Mah\u0101nagar'' in [[Nepal Mandala]].  Mah\u0101nagar means \"great city\". The city is called \"K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhama\u1e47\u1e0dap\" in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhama\u1e47\u1e0dap.  During medieval times, the city was sometimes called [[Kantipur|K\u0101ntipur]] (\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words \u2013 ''K\u0101nti'' and ''pur''. \"K\u0101nti\" is a word that stands for \"beauty\" and is mostly associated with light and \"pur\" means place, thus giving it the meaning, \"City of light\".\n\nAmong the indigenous Newar people, Kathmandu is known as ''Ye\u1e43 De\u015ba'' (\u092f\u0947\u0901 \u0926\u0947\u0936), and Patan and Bhaktapur are known as ''Yala De\u015ba'' (\u092f\u0932 \u0926\u0947\u0936) and ''Khwopa De\u015ba'' (\u0916\u094d\u0935\u092a \u0926\u0947\u0936).<ref>{{cite book |last = Kirkpatrick |first = Colonel |url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ijxAAAAAYAAJ |title = An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul |publisher = London: William Miller |year = 1811 |accessdate = 9 March 2012 |page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ijxAAAAAYAAJ/page/n191 159] }} pp. 162\u201363</ref> \"Yen\" is the shorter form of ''Yambu'' (\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941), which originally referred to the northern half of Kathmandu.

The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa [[Manjusri]]  <nowiki/>with his sword, and the water was evacuated out from there.  He then established a city called Manjupattan, and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land. After some time, a demon named Banasur closed the outlet, and the valley again turned into a lake. Then lord [[Krishna]] came to [[Nepal]], killed Banasur, and again drained out the water.

Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler, Jitedasti, Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at [[Sankhu]].\n\n[[File:Nepaul valley map 1802.jpg|thumb|Map of Kathmandu, 1802]]\n\n==== Licchavi era ====\nThe Licchavis from the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]] migrated north and defeated the Kiratas, establishing the Licchavi dynasty, circa 400 AD. During this era, following the genocide of [[Shakya]]s in [[Lumbini]] by [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]], the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery lora masquerading as Koliyas. From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu. This created the basis of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dsbcproject.org/manuscripts/short-history |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130414141212/http://www.dsbcproject.org/manuscripts/short-history |url-status = dead |archive-date = 14 April 2013 |title = A Short History of Sanskrit Buddhist Manuscripts |publisher = Dsbcproject.org |accessdate = 24 November 2013 }}</ref> With their migration, Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward+No.+23_38 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622181813/http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward%2BNo.%2B23_38 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 June 2012 |title=Kathmandu Metropolitan City |publisher=Kathmandu.gov.np |accessdate=24 November 2013 }}</ref> during most of the Licchavi era.<ref name=\"\u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092a \u0915\u093f \u0939\u094b\u092e\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092a\">{{cite web |url = http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=37878&cat_id=22 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120706165415/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=37878&cat_id=22 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 6 July 2012 |title = \u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092a \u0915\u093f \u0939\u094b\u092e\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092a |publisher = Gorkhapatra.org.np |accessdate = 24 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nEventually, the Licchavi ruler [[Gunakamadeva]] merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram, founding the city of Kathmandu.<ref name=\"\u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092a \u0915\u093f \u0939\u094b\u092e\u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092a\"/> The city was designed in the shape of ''Chandrahrasa'', the sword of Manjushri. The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by [[Ajima]]s. One of these barracks is still in use at [[Bhadrakali, Nepal|Bhadrakali]] (in front of [[Singha Durbar]]). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travellers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king [[Amshuverma]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120203517/http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 20 January 2012 |title = \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0905\u091a\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0932\u0930\u0940\u092e\u093e &#124; \u0915\u0932\u093e \u0930 \u0936\u0948\u0932\u0940 &#124; :: \u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930  |publisher = Ekantipur.com |accessdate = 15 January 2012 }}</ref> The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people\u2014the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley\u2014became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout [[Asia]], creating religious art for their neighbours. For example, [[Araniko]] led a group of his compatriot artists through [[Tibet]] and [[China]]. [[Bhrikuti]], the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch [[Songts\u00e4n Gampo]], was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.\n\n==== Malla era ====\n[[File:Kathmandu 1811.jpg|thumb|Skyline of Kathmandu, circa 1793]]\n[[File:Kathmandu durbar square.jpg|thumb|Kathmandu Durbar Square, 1852]]\nThe Licchavi era was followed by the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla era]]. Rulers from [[Tirhut]], upon being attacked by [[Muslim]]s, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from [[Khas]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king [[Abhaya Malla]]. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between [[India]] and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.\n\nDuring the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, esthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, the institutionalisation of trusts (called [[guthi]]s), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king [[Pratap Malla]]. Books have been found from this era that describe their [[Tantra|tantric]] tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g.&nbsp;Haramekhala), religion (e.g.&nbsp;Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]], [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]], the former durbar of [[Kirtipur]], [[Nyatapola]], Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and others.\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Old narayanhiti palace.jpg|thumb|The now demolished old royal palace in 1920]]\n\n==== Early Shah rule ====\n\nThe [[Gorkha Kingdom]] ended the Malla confederation after the [[Battle of Kathmandu]] in 1768. This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu. The [[Battle of Kirtipur]] was the start of the [[History of Kathmandu#1769-1845|Gorkha conquest]] of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire, and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal. During the early part of this era, Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture. Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighbouring nations. [[Bhimsen Thapa]] supported [[France]] against Great Britain; this led to the development of modern military structures, such as modern barracks in Kathmandu. The nine-storey tower [[Dharahara]] was originally built during this era.\n\n==== Rana rule ====\n\nRana rule over Nepal started with the [[Kot Massacre]], which occurred near Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. During this massacre, most of Nepal's high-ranking officials were massacred by [[Jang Bahadur Rana]] and his supporters. Another massacre, the [[List of massacres in Nepal|Bhandarkhal Massacre]], was also conducted by Kunwar and his supporters in Kathmandu. During the Rana regime, Kathmandu's alliance shifted from anti-British to pro-British; this led to the construction of the first buildings in the style of Western European architecture. The most well-known of these buildings include [[Singha Durbar]], [[Garden of Dreams]], Shital Niwas, and the old Narayanhiti palace. The first modern commercial road in the Kathmandu Valley, the [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]], was also built during this era. Trichandra College (the first college of Nepal), Durbar School (the first modern school of Nepal), and Bir Hospital (the first hospital of Nepal) were built in Kathmandu during this era. Rana rule was marked by despotism, economic exploitation and religious persecution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dietrich |first=Angela |title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=24 September 2013 |newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods |year=1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124156/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |archivedate=1 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Lal |first = C.

The city is in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and [[China]], helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading centre over the centuries. Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the [[Silk Road]] which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newar merchants]] of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lewis |first = Todd T |title = Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants |url = http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/ |accessdate = 28 July 2012 }}</ref> Other traditional occupations are farming, metal casting, woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.<ref name=economy>{{cite web |url = http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=5&pr_id=5 |title = Economy |accessdate = 20 December 2009 |publisher = Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal }}</ref>\n\nKathmandu is the most important industrial and commercial centre in Nepal. The [[Nepal Stock Exchange]], the head office of the [[Nepal Rastra Bank|national bank]], the [[FNCCI|chamber of commerce]], as well as head offices of national and international banks, telecommunication companies, the electricity authority, and various other national and international organizations are in Kathmandu.

This industry started around 1950, as the country's political makeup changed and ended the country's isolation from the rest of the world. In 1956, air transportation was established and the [[Tribhuvan Highway]], between Kathmandu and [[Raxaul]] (at India's border), was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity; some of these include the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal, and in Kathmandu in particular.<ref name=\"Shrestha p.86-89\">Shrestha pp. 86\u201389</ref>\n\nSince then, tourism in Nepal has thrived. It is the country's most important industry.<ref>{{cite news |title = Tourism in Nepal |url = http://www.expeditionsnepal.com/where-is-nepal/ }}</ref> Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]], [[Swayambhunath]], [[Boudhanath]], [[Changu Narayan|Changunarayan]] and [[Budhanilkantha]]. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number increased to 491,504 in 1999/2000. Following the end of the Maoist insurgency, there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into the Democratic Republic. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining{{why|date=March 2013}}. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country.<ref name=\"Shrestha p.86-89\"/>\n\nThe neighbourhood of [[Thamel]] is Kathmandu's primary \"traveller's ghetto\", packed with guest houses, restaurants, shops, and bookstores, catering to tourists.

The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms (Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur); the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty.

The outer quadrangle has the [[Kasthamandap]], [[Kumari (children)|Kumari Ghar]], and Shiva-Parvati Temple; the inner quadrangle has the [[Hanuman Dhoka]] palace. The squares were severely damaged in the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].\n\nHanuman Dhoka is a complex of structures with the Royal Palace of the Malla kings and of the Shah dynasty. It is spread over five acres. The eastern wing, with ten courtyards, is the oldest part, dating to the mid-16th century. It was expanded by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century with many temples. The royal family lived in this palace until 1886 when they moved to Narayanhiti Palace. The stone inscription outside is in fifteen languages.\n\nKumari Ghar is a palace in the centre of the Kathmandu city, next to the Durbar square where a [[Kumari (children)|Royal Kumari]] selected from several Kumaris resides. Kumari, or Kumari Devi, is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or ''devi'' in South Asian countries. In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous. Previously, during the time of monarchy, the queen and the priests used to appoint the proposed Kumari with delicate process of astrological examination and physical examination of 32 'gunas'.The 'china', an ancient Hindu astrological report, of the Kumari and the reigning king was ought to be similar.  Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status. The current Kumari, Trishna Shakya, age three at the time of appointment, was installed in September 2017 succeeding Matina Shakya who was the first Kumari of Kathmandu after the end of monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.visitnepal.com/nepal_information/kumari.php |title = Kumari Devi&nbsp;\u2013 The Living Goddess |publisher = Visitnepal.com |accessdate = 19 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Kasthamandap]] is a three-storeyed temple enshrining an image of [[Gorakhnath]].

This is among the oldest religious sites in [[Nepal]]. Although the site is considered Buddhist, it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus. The stupa consists of a dome at the base; above the dome, there is a cubic structure with the eyes of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] looking in all four directions.{{clarify|date=March 2013}} There are pentagonal ''[[torana|toran]]'' above each of the four sides, with statues engraved on them.

The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards and in open ground. Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time, but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950.<ref name=\"Jha p.21\"/>\n\nThe religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: Bhavani, Durga, Gaja-Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses), and Sri-Lakshmi(wealth-goddess). From the 3rd century BCE, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the [[Ashoka]]n period (it is said that [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashoka]] visited Nepal in 250&nbsp;BC) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] or classical period (500 to 900&nbsp;AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400&nbsp;AD), with strong influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly [[tantra|tantric]] influences coupled with the art of [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] [[Demonology]].<ref name=\"Jha p.23\">Jha p. 23</ref>\n\nA broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and carvings created by the people of Nepal. These artists have maintained a blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. The typology, based on the type of material used are: stone art, metal art, wood art, terracotta art, and painting.<ref>Jha pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\n==== Museums ====\nKathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the [[National Museum of Nepal]] and the Natural History Museum of Nepal. Nepal's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. These are amply reflected in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artefacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day, including archeological exportation.<ref name=asia>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and Art Galleries of Nepal |publisher=Asiatravel.com |accessdate=18 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819000914/http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archivedate= 19 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nKathmandu museums and art galleries include:<ref name=asia/>\n* [[The National Museum of nepal|The National Museum]]\n* [[Natural history museum|The Natural History Museum]]\n* [[Hanuman Dhoka|Hanumandhoka Palace Complex]]\n* [[Kaiser Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana#Kaiser Library|The Kaiser Library]]\n* [[The National Art Gallery nepal|The National Art Gallery]]\n* The NEF-ART (Nepal Fine Art) Gallery\n* The Nepal Art Council Gallery\n* [[Narayanhiti Palace|Narayanhiti Palace Museum]]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/TheTaragaonMuseum The Taragaon Museum]\n\n[[File:Nepal.Museum.JPG|thumb|National Museum of Nepal]]\n\nThe National Museum is in the western part of Kathmandu, near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building. This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General [[Bhimsen Thapa]]. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance. The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was ''Chhauni [[Chhauni Silkhana|Silkhana]]'', meaning \"the stone house of arms and ammunition\". Given its focus, the museum contains many weapons, including locally made firearms used in wars, [[leather]] [[cannon]]s from the 18th\u201319th century, and medieval and modern works in [[wood]], [[bronze]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[painting]]s.<ref name=\"Museums\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and art galleries |publisher=Asia Travel |accessdate=18 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819000914/http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archivedate= 19 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Natural History Museum is in the southern foothills of [[Swayambhunath]] hill and has a sizeable collection of different species of animals, [[butterflies]], and plants.

It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings, letters, and papers, memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members. The [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]] Museum is dedicated to the king [[Mahendra of Nepal]] (1920\u20131972). Like the Tribhuvan Museum, it includes his personal belongings such as decorations, [[Postage stamp|stamps]], [[coin]]s and personal notes and manuscripts, but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber. The Hanumandhoka Palace, a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar, contains three separate museums of historic importance. These museums include the Birendra museum, which contains items related to the second-last monarch, [[Birendra of Nepal]].<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\nThe enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu. \"[[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity]]\" comes from ''Narayana'', a form of the Hindu god [[Lord Vishnu]], and ''Hiti'', meaning \"water spout\" (Vishnu's temple is opposite the palace, and the water spout is east of the main entrance to the precinct). Narayanhity was a new palace, in front of the old palace built in 1915, and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary [[Pagoda]]. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of [[King Birendra|King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah]], then heir apparent to the throne.

[[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]] in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as [[Paubha]]s in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as [[Thangka]]s in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for.<ref name=\"Museums\"/> Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |title = Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre |publisher = Kathmanduarts.org |accessdate = 4 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nKathmandu contains many notable art galleries. The NAFA Gallery, operated by the Arts and crafts Department of the [[Nepal Academy]] is housed in Sita Bhavan, a neo-classical old Rana palace.<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\nThe Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery, inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds, hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors, and regularly organizes exhibitions. It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art. Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery, in a three-storied building in [[Bhimsen Thapa|Bhimsenthan]] which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade [[doll]]s and items typical of a medieval [[Newar]] house, giving an important insight into Nepali history. The J Art Gallery is also in Kathmandu, near the Royal Palace in [[Durbar Marg|Durbarmarg]], Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent, established Nepali painters. The Nepal Art Council Gallery, in the Babar Mahal, on the way to [[Tribhuvan International Airport]] contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions.<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\n==== Literature ====\n\n[[File:Asa Archives, Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Asa Archives]]\n\nThe National Library of Nepal is in [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]]. It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books. English, [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], and [[Nepal Bhasa]] books are found here. The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD. Kathmandu also contains the Keshar Library, in the Keshar Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building. This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of [[Keshar Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, and philosophy, as well as a Sanskrit manual of [[Tantra]], which is believed to be over 1,000 years old.<ref name=\"Museums\"/> The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building, and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated.\n\nThe Asa Archives are also noteworthy. They specialize in medieval history and religious traditions of the Kathmandu Valley. The archives, in Kulambhulu, have a collection of some 6,000 loose-leaf handwritten books and 1,000 palm-leaf manuscripts (mostly in Sanskrit or Nepal Bhasa) and a manuscript dated to 1464.<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\n==== Cinema and theatre ====\n\nKathmandu is home to [[Cinema of Nepal|Nepali cinema]] and theatres. The city contains several theatres, including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path, the Ganga Theatre, the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982. The M. Art Theater is based in the city. The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival, attracting artists from all over the world.<ref>{{cite news |title = Theatre fest begins |url = http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/11/17/et-cetera/theatre-fest-begins/214962/ |archive-url = https://archive.today/20140101154140/http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/11/17/et-cetera/theatre-fest-begins/214962/ |url-status = dead |archive-date = 1 January 2014 |accessdate = 1 January 2014 |newspaper = The Kathmandu Post |date = 18 November 2010 }}</ref> A mini theatre is also at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee.\n\nKathmandu has a number of cinemas (old single screen establishments and some new multiplexes) showing Nepali, [[Bollywood]], and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films.

Kathmandu also houses some international standard cinema theatres and multiplexes, such as [[QFX Cinemas|QFX]] Cinemas, Cine De Chef, Fcube Cinemas, Q's Cinemas Big Movies, BSR Movies, etc.\n\n==== Music ====\n\n[[File:Gunla bajan performance.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Buddhist musical performance during [[Gunla]]]]\n\nKathmandu is the center of music and dance in Nepal, and these art forms are integral to understanding the city. Musical performances are organized in cultural venues. Music is a part of the traditional aspect of Kathmandu. [[Gunla]] is the traditional music festival according to [[Nepal Sambat]]. Newar music originated in Kathmandu. Furthermore, music from all over Nepal can be found in Kathmandu.\n\nA number of [[hippie]]s visited Kathmandu during the 1970s and introduced [[Rock and Roll|rock and roll]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[jazz]] to the city. Kathmandu is noted internationally for its [[jazz]] festival, popularly known as [[Jazzmandu]]. It is the only jazz festival in the Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide, such as [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[United States]], [[Benin]], and [[India]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe city has been referenced in numerous songs, including works by [[Cat Stevens]] ('Katmandu', ''[[Mona Bone Jakon]]'' (1970)), [[Bob Seger]] ('Katmandu', ''[[Beautiful Loser]]'' (1975)), [[Rush (band)|Rush]] ('[[A Passage to Bangkok]]', ''Pulling into Kathmandu''; ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', 1976), [[Krematorij]] ('Kathmandu', ''Three Springs'' (2000)), [[Fito P\u00e1ez]] (''Tr\u00e1fico por Katmand\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"Traffic through Kathmandu\") and Cavalcade ('Kathmandu Kid') 2019.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\n[[File:Dalbath.jpg|thumb|One of the typical Nepali meals [[Dal bhat]] in Kathmandu]]\n\nThe staple food of most people in Kathmandu is [[dal bhat]]. This consists of rice and lentil soup, generally served with vegetable curries, achar and sometimes Chutney. [[Momo (food)|Momo]], a type of Nepali version of Tibetan dumpling, has become prominent in Nepal with many street vendors and restaurants selling it. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu. Various Nepali variants of momo including buff (i.e. buffalo) momo, chicken momo, and vegetarian momo are famous in Kathmandu.  <!-- This article is about Kathmandu and most Nepali in Kathmandu have dal bhat as their day to day meal and are able to afford a simple meal of dal bhat and NOT any exotic and other cultural cuisines. Please see the talk regarding this discussion. The local cuisine of Kathmandu as of NOW is dal bhat and the cuisine as local is considered to be what the residents take not what a particular ethnic group takes.-->\n\nMost of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian. However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. ''Buff'' (meat of water buffalo) is very common. There is a strong tradition of ''buff'' consumption in Kathmandu, especially among [[Newar]]s, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims considers it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating ''buff'' as from [[Quran]] while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow's meat as they consider [[Cattle|Cow]] to be a goddess and symbol of purity. The chief lunch/snack for locals and visitors is mostly ''Momo'' or ''Chowmein''.\n\nKathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955.<ref name=\"LP 2003, p.91\">Lonely Planet (2003), pp. 91\u201392</ref> A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened, catering [[Nepali cuisine]], [[Tibetan cuisine]], [[Chinese cuisine]] and [[Indian cuisine]] in particular. Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American [[chop suey]], which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a [[fried egg]] commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine.<ref name=\"LP 2003, p.91\"/> Continental cuisine can be found in selected places.

Traditionally, these festivals were celebrated by Newars. In recent years, these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well. As the capital of the Republic of Nepal, various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu. With mass migration to the city, the cultures of Khas from the west, [[Kirati people|Kirats]] from the east, Bon/Tibetan from the north, and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) Jatra, [[Indra Jatra]], Dashain [[Durga Puja]] festivals, [[Shivratri]] and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporates Hindu traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of the Buddhist religion.\n\nCultural continuity has been maintained for centuries in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities in Kathmandu and the rest of the country.

The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the [[Bagmati Zone|Bagmati]] River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n{{Main|Buddhism in Nepal}}\n\nBuddhism started in Kathmandu with the arrival of Buddhist monks during the time of Buddha (c. 563 \u2013 483 BCE<ref name=Cousins>L. S. Cousins (1996), \"[http://indology.info/papers/cousins The dating of the historical Buddha]: a review article\", ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'' '''(3)6(1)''': 57\u201363.</ref>). They started a forest monastery in [[Sankhu]]. This monastery was renovated by [[Shakya]]s after they fled genocide from [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]] (rule: 491\u2013461 BCE).\n\nDuring the Hindu Lichchavi era (c. 400 to 750), various monasteries and orders were created which successively led to the formation of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is still practiced in the primary [[liturgical language]] of Hinduism, [[Sanskrit]].\n\nLegendary Princess [[Bhrikuti]] (7th-century) and artist [[Araniko]] (1245\u20131306 CE) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals and Bahis) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.\n===Islam ===\n{{Main|Islam in Nepal|Nepalese Muslims}}\n\nIslam people pray to Allah on Friday(the day of Namaj) often going to the Jame Masjid, Ghantaghar near Ratnapark.\n[[File:Mosquektm (74).JPG|thumb|Mosquektm (74)]]\n\n=== Kirat Mundhum ===\n{{Main|Kirat Mundhum}}\nKirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous [[animism|animistic]] practices of Nepal. It is practiced by [[Kirat people]]. Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs, such as ancestor worship (worship of Ajima) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin. Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats, such as Pashupatinath, Wanga Akash Bhairabh (Yalambar) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu. Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice [[Mundhum]] in the city.<ref name=\"Broadening the Nepali mind http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-02-02/broadening-the-nepali-mind.html\">{{Cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-02-02/broadening-the-nepali-mind.html | title=Broadening the Nepali mind}}</ref>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n[[Sikhism]] is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole. An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct. [[Jainism in Nepal|Jainism]] is practiced by a small community. A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar, where Jains practice their faith. According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Baha'is]] of Nepal, there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley. They have a National Office in Shantinagar, Baneshwor. The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu. Islam is practiced in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority, accounting for about 4.2% of the population of Nepal.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches. Christian missionary hospitals, welfare organizations, and schools are also operating. Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies, who had converted to Christianity while in service, on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion. They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu, in particular.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://across.co.nz/NepalChurches.html |title = Churches in Nepal |publisher = Across.co.nz |accessdate = 20 December 2009 }}</ref><ref name =Christ>{{cite web |url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35518.htm |title = US Department of State: Diplomacy in Action |accessdate = 20 December 2009 |publisher = [[US Department of State]] }}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe oldest modern school in Nepal is [[Durbar High School]], and the oldest college, [[Tri Chandra College]], are both in Kathmandu city.

Every year thousands of students from all over Nepal arrive at Kathmandu to get admission in the various schools and colleges.\nOne of the key concerns of educationists and concerned citizens is the massive outflux of students from Nepal to outside Nepal for studies. Every year thousands of students apply for No objection certificates for studying abroad. Consultancy firms specializing in preparing students to go abroad can be found in all prominent locations. The reason for such an outflux range from perceived low quality of education, political instability, fewer opportunities in the job market, opportunities for earning while learning abroad and better job prospects with an international degree.\n\n== Medical colleges ==\n\n[[Institute of Medicine]], the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu.

\n\nKathmandu, also known as the city of temples, with one of the oldest Pagodas known as Pashupatinath Temple, stands at an elevation of approximately {{convert|1400|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley in central Nepal. The valley is historically termed as \"Nepal Mandala\" and has been the home of [[Newar people]], a cosmopolitan urban civilization in the [[Himalayas]] foothills. The city was the royal capital of the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] and hosts palaces, mansions and gardens of the Nepalese aristocracy. It has been home to the headquarters of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[SAARC]]) since 1985. Today, it is the seat of government of the Nepalese republic established in 2008 and is part of the [[Bagmati Pradesh|Bagmati province]].\n\nKathmandu is and has been for many years the centre of Nepal's [[History of Nepal|history]], [[Newa art|art]], [[Culture of Nepal|culture]], and [[Economy of Nepal|economy]]. It has a multi-ethnic population within a [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] majority. It is also the home of the [[Newars]]. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu.\n\n[[Tourism]] is an important part of the economy. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top ten upcoming travel destinations in the world by [[TripAdvisor]], and ranked first in Asia. The city is the gateway to the Nepalese Himalayas and home to several [[World Heritage site|world heritage sites]]: [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Durbar Square]], [[Swayambhunath]], [[Boudhanath]] and [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]]. \n\nHistoric areas of Kathmandu were severely damaged by a [[2015 Nepal earthquake|7.8 magnitude earthquake]] on 25 April 2015. Some of the buildings have been restored and some are in the process of reconstruction until now.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nIndigenous [[Newar people|Newari]] term for Kathmandu valley is ''Yei''. The [[Nepali language|Nepali]] name ''Kathmandu'' comes from [[Kasthamandap]], which stood in [[Kathmandu Durbar Square|Durbar Square]]. In [[Sanskrit]], ''Kastha'' ({{lang-sa|\u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920}}) means \"Wood\" and ''Ma\u1e47\u1e0dapa'' ({{lang-sa|\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0921\u092a}}) means \"Pavilion\". This public pavilion, also known as ''Maru Satta'' in [[Newar language]], was rebuilt in 1596 by Biseth in the period of King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The three-story structure was made entirely of wood and used no iron nails nor supports. According to legend, all the timber used to build the [[pagoda]] was obtained from a single tree.<ref name=introd>{{cite web |url = http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=1&pr_id=1 |title = Introduction |accessdate = 12 December 2009 |publisher = Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal }}</ref> The structure collapsed during a major earthquake on 25 April 2015.\n\nThe [[colophon (publishing)|colophons]] of ancient manuscripts, dated as late as the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as ''K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhama\u1e47\u1e0dap Mah\u0101nagar'' in [[Nepal Mandala]].  Mah\u0101nagar means \"great city\". The city is called \"K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhama\u1e47\u1e0dap\" in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as K\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dhama\u1e47\u1e0dap.  During medieval times, the city was sometimes called [[Kantipur|K\u0101ntipur]] (\u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words \u2013 ''K\u0101nti'' and ''pur''. \"K\u0101nti\" is a word that stands for \"beauty\" and is mostly associated with light and \"pur\" means place, thus giving it the meaning, \"City of light\".\n\nAmong the indigenous Newar people, Kathmandu is known as ''Ye\u1e43 De\u015ba'' (\u092f\u0947\u0901 \u0926\u0947\u0936), and Patan and Bhaktapur are known as ''Yala De\u015ba'' (\u092f\u0932 \u0926\u0947\u0936) and ''Khwopa De\u015ba'' (\u0916\u094d\u0935\u092a \u0926\u0947\u0936).<ref>{{cite book |last = Kirkpatrick |first = Colonel |url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ijxAAAAAYAAJ |title = An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul |publisher = London: William Miller |year = 1811 |accessdate = 9 March 2012 |page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ijxAAAAAYAAJ/page/n191 159] }} pp. 162\u201363</ref> \"Yen\" is the shorter form of ''Yambu'' (\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941), which originally referred to the northern half of Kathmandu.

According to [[Swayambhu Purana]], present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake named \"Nagdaha\", as it was full of snakes. The lake was cut drained by Bodhisatwa [[Manjusri]]  <nowiki/>with his sword, and the water was evacuated out from there.  He then established a city called Manjupattan, and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land. After some time, a demon named Banasur closed the outlet, and the valley again turned into a lake. Then lord [[Krishna]] came to [[Nepal]], killed Banasur, and again drained out the water.

During the Kirata era, a settlement called [[Yambu (Nepal)|Yambu]] existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu. In some of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler, Jitedasti, Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at [[Sankhu]].\n\n[[File:Nepaul valley map 1802.jpg|thumb|Map of Kathmandu, 1802]]\n\n==== Licchavi era ====\nThe Licchavis from the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]] migrated north and defeated the Kiratas, establishing the Licchavi dynasty, circa 400 AD. During this era, following the genocide of [[Shakya]]s in [[Lumbini]] by [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]], the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery lora masquerading as Koliyas. From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu.

The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by [[Ajima]]s. One of these barracks is still in use at [[Bhadrakali, Nepal|Bhadrakali]] (in front of [[Singha Durbar]]). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travellers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king [[Amshuverma]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120203517/http://www.ekantipur.com/kantipur/news/news-detail.php?news_id=224549 |url-status = dead |archive-date = 20 January 2012 |title = \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0905\u091a\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0932\u0930\u0940\u092e\u093e &#124; \u0915\u0932\u093e \u0930 \u0936\u0948\u0932\u0940 &#124; :: \u0915\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930  |publisher = Ekantipur.com |accessdate = 15 January 2012 }}</ref> The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people\u2014the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley\u2014became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout [[Asia]], creating religious art for their neighbours. For example, [[Araniko]] led a group of his compatriot artists through [[Tibet]] and [[China]]. [[Bhrikuti]], the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch [[Songts\u00e4n Gampo]], was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.\n\n==== Malla era ====\n[[File:Kathmandu 1811.jpg|thumb|Skyline of Kathmandu, circa 1793]]\n[[File:Kathmandu durbar square.jpg|thumb|Kathmandu Durbar Square, 1852]]\nThe Licchavi era was followed by the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla era]]. Rulers from [[Tirhut]], upon being attacked by [[Muslim]]s, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from [[Khas]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king [[Abhaya Malla]]. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between [[India]] and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.\n\nDuring the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, esthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, the institutionalisation of trusts (called [[guthi]]s), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king [[Pratap Malla]]. Books have been found from this era that describe their [[Tantra|tantric]] tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g.&nbsp;Haramekhala), religion (e.g.&nbsp;Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]], [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]], the former durbar of [[Kirtipur]], [[Nyatapola]], Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and others.\n\n=== Modern era ===\n[[File:Old narayanhiti palace.jpg|thumb|The now demolished old royal palace in 1920]]\n\n==== Early Shah rule ====\n\nThe [[Gorkha Kingdom]] ended the Malla confederation after the [[Battle of Kathmandu]] in 1768. This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu. The [[Battle of Kirtipur]] was the start of the [[History of Kathmandu#1769-1845|Gorkha conquest]] of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire, and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal. During the early part of this era, Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture. Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighbouring nations. [[Bhimsen Thapa]] supported [[France]] against Great Britain; this led to the development of modern military structures, such as modern barracks in Kathmandu. The nine-storey tower [[Dharahara]] was originally built during this era.\n\n==== Rana rule ====\n\nRana rule over Nepal started with the [[Kot Massacre]], which occurred near Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. During this massacre, most of Nepal's high-ranking officials were massacred by [[Jang Bahadur Rana]] and his supporters. Another massacre, the [[List of massacres in Nepal|Bhandarkhal Massacre]], was also conducted by Kunwar and his supporters in Kathmandu. During the Rana regime, Kathmandu's alliance shifted from anti-British to pro-British; this led to the construction of the first buildings in the style of Western European architecture. The most well-known of these buildings include [[Singha Durbar]], [[Garden of Dreams]], Shital Niwas, and the old Narayanhiti palace. The first modern commercial road in the Kathmandu Valley, the [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]], was also built during this era. Trichandra College (the first college of Nepal), Durbar School (the first modern school of Nepal), and Bir Hospital (the first hospital of Nepal) were built in Kathmandu during this era. Rana rule was marked by despotism, economic exploitation and religious persecution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dietrich |first=Angela |title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=24 September 2013 |newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods |year=1996 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124156/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |archivedate=1 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Lal |first = C.

The city is in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and [[China]], helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading centre over the centuries. Kathmandu's trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the [[Silk Road]] which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newar merchants]] of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lewis |first = Todd T |title = Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants |url = http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/ |accessdate = 28 July 2012 }}</ref> Other traditional occupations are farming, metal casting, woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.<ref name=economy>{{cite web |url = http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/index.php?cid=5&pr_id=5 |title = Economy |accessdate = 20 December 2009 |publisher = Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Government of Nepal }}</ref>\n\nKathmandu is the most important industrial and commercial centre in Nepal. The [[Nepal Stock Exchange]], the head office of the [[Nepal Rastra Bank|national bank]], the [[FNCCI|chamber of commerce]], as well as head offices of national and international banks, telecommunication companies, the electricity authority, and various other national and international organizations are in Kathmandu.

This industry started around 1950, as the country's political makeup changed and ended the country's isolation from the rest of the world. In 1956, air transportation was established and the [[Tribhuvan Highway]], between Kathmandu and [[Raxaul]] (at India's border), was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity; some of these include the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal, and in Kathmandu in particular.<ref name=\"Shrestha p.86-89\">Shrestha pp. 86\u201389</ref>\n\nSince then, tourism in Nepal has thrived. It is the country's most important industry.<ref>{{cite news |title = Tourism in Nepal |url = http://www.expeditionsnepal.com/where-is-nepal/ }}</ref> Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu's religious sites such as [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]], [[Swayambhunath]], [[Boudhanath]], [[Changu Narayan|Changunarayan]] and [[Budhanilkantha]]. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number increased to 491,504 in 1999/2000. Following the end of the Maoist insurgency, there was a significant rise of 509,956 tourist arrivals in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country turned into the Democratic Republic. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8% of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining{{why|date=March 2013}}. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the rich cultural heritage of the country.<ref name=\"Shrestha p.86-89\"/>\n\nThe neighbourhood of [[Thamel]] is Kathmandu's primary \"traveller's ghetto\", packed with guest houses, restaurants, shops, and bookstores, catering to tourists.

The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms (Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur); the earliest is the Licchavi dynasty. The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the [[Durbar Square|Durbar]] Square. The outer quadrangle has the [[Kasthamandap]], [[Kumari (children)|Kumari Ghar]], and Shiva-Parvati Temple; the inner quadrangle has the [[Hanuman Dhoka]] palace. The squares were severely damaged in the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].\n\nHanuman Dhoka is a complex of structures with the Royal Palace of the Malla kings and of the Shah dynasty. It is spread over five acres. The eastern wing, with ten courtyards, is the oldest part, dating to the mid-16th century. It was expanded by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century with many temples. The royal family lived in this palace until 1886 when they moved to Narayanhiti Palace. The stone inscription outside is in fifteen languages.\n\nKumari Ghar is a palace in the centre of the Kathmandu city, next to the Durbar square where a [[Kumari (children)|Royal Kumari]] selected from several Kumaris resides. Kumari, or Kumari Devi, is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or ''devi'' in South Asian countries. In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous. Previously, during the time of monarchy, the queen and the priests used to appoint the proposed Kumari with delicate process of astrological examination and physical examination of 32 'gunas'.The 'china', an ancient Hindu astrological report, of the Kumari and the reigning king was ought to be similar.  Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status. The current Kumari, Trishna Shakya, age three at the time of appointment, was installed in September 2017 succeeding Matina Shakya who was the first Kumari of Kathmandu after the end of monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.visitnepal.com/nepal_information/kumari.php |title = Kumari Devi&nbsp;\u2013 The Living Goddess |publisher = Visitnepal.com |accessdate = 19 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[Kasthamandap]] is a three-storeyed temple enshrining an image of [[Gorakhnath]].

The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards and in open ground. Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time, but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950.<ref name=\"Jha p.21\"/>\n\nThe religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: Bhavani, Durga, Gaja-Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses), and Sri-Lakshmi(wealth-goddess). From the 3rd century BCE, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the [[Ashoka]]n period (it is said that [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashoka]] visited Nepal in 250&nbsp;BC) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] or classical period (500 to 900&nbsp;AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400&nbsp;AD), with strong influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly [[tantra|tantric]] influences coupled with the art of [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan]] [[Demonology]].<ref name=\"Jha p.23\">Jha p. 23</ref>\n\nA broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and carvings created by the people of Nepal. These artists have maintained a blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. The typology, based on the type of material used are: stone art, metal art, wood art, terracotta art, and painting.<ref>Jha pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\n==== Museums ====\nKathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the [[National Museum of Nepal]] and the Natural History Museum of Nepal. Nepal's art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. These are amply reflected in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artefacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day, including archeological exportation.<ref name=asia>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and Art Galleries of Nepal |publisher=Asiatravel.com |accessdate=18 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819000914/http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archivedate= 19 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nKathmandu museums and art galleries include:<ref name=asia/>\n* [[The National Museum of nepal|The National Museum]]\n* [[Natural history museum|The Natural History Museum]]\n* [[Hanuman Dhoka|Hanumandhoka Palace Complex]]\n* [[Kaiser Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana#Kaiser Library|The Kaiser Library]]\n* [[The National Art Gallery nepal|The National Art Gallery]]\n* The NEF-ART (Nepal Fine Art) Gallery\n* The Nepal Art Council Gallery\n* [[Narayanhiti Palace|Narayanhiti Palace Museum]]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/TheTaragaonMuseum The Taragaon Museum]\n\n[[File:Nepal.Museum.JPG|thumb|National Museum of Nepal]]\n\nThe National Museum is in the western part of Kathmandu, near the Swayambhunath stupa in an historical building.

It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance. The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was ''Chhauni [[Chhauni Silkhana|Silkhana]]'', meaning \"the stone house of arms and ammunition\". Given its focus, the museum contains many weapons, including locally made firearms used in wars, [[leather]] [[cannon]]s from the 18th\u201319th century, and medieval and modern works in [[wood]], [[bronze]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[painting]]s.<ref name=\"Museums\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |title=Museums and art galleries |publisher=Asia Travel |accessdate=18 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819000914/http://www.asiatravel.com/nepal/nepalgal.html |archivedate= 19 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Natural History Museum is in the southern foothills of [[Swayambhunath]] hill and has a sizeable collection of different species of animals, [[butterflies]], and plants.

The [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]] Museum is dedicated to the king [[Mahendra of Nepal]] (1920\u20131972). Like the Tribhuvan Museum, it includes his personal belongings such as decorations, [[Postage stamp|stamps]], [[coin]]s and personal notes and manuscripts, but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber. The Hanumandhoka Palace, a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar, contains three separate museums of historic importance. These museums include the Birendra museum, which contains items related to the second-last monarch, [[Birendra of Nepal]].<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\nThe enclosed compound of the Narayanhity Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu. \"[[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity]]\" comes from ''Narayana'', a form of the Hindu god [[Lord Vishnu]], and ''Hiti'', meaning \"water spout\" (Vishnu's temple is opposite the palace, and the water spout is east of the main entrance to the precinct). Narayanhity was a new palace, in front of the old palace built in 1915, and was built in 1970 in the form of a contemporary [[Pagoda]]. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of [[King Birendra|King Birenda Bir Bikram Shah]], then heir apparent to the throne.

[[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]] in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as [[Paubha]]s in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as [[Thangka]]s in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for.<ref name=\"Museums\"/> Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kathmanduarts.org/ |title = Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre |publisher = Kathmanduarts.org |accessdate = 4 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nKathmandu contains many notable art galleries.

It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art. Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery, in a three-storied building in [[Bhimsen Thapa|Bhimsenthan]] which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade [[doll]]s and items typical of a medieval [[Newar]] house, giving an important insight into Nepali history. The J Art Gallery is also in Kathmandu, near the Royal Palace in [[Durbar Marg|Durbarmarg]], Kathmandu and displays the artwork of eminent, established Nepali painters. The Nepal Art Council Gallery, in the Babar Mahal, on the way to [[Tribhuvan International Airport]] contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions.<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\n==== Literature ====\n\n[[File:Asa Archives, Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Asa Archives]]\n\nThe National Library of Nepal is in [[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]]. It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books. English, [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], and [[Nepal Bhasa]] books are found here. The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD. Kathmandu also contains the Keshar Library, in the Keshar Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building. This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of [[Keshar Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]]. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, and philosophy, as well as a Sanskrit manual of [[Tantra]], which is believed to be over 1,000 years old.<ref name=\"Museums\"/> The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building, and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated.\n\nThe Asa Archives are also noteworthy. They specialize in medieval history and religious traditions of the Kathmandu Valley. The archives, in Kulambhulu, have a collection of some 6,000 loose-leaf handwritten books and 1,000 palm-leaf manuscripts (mostly in Sanskrit or Nepal Bhasa) and a manuscript dated to 1464.<ref name=\"Museums\"/>\n\n==== Cinema and theatre ====\n\nKathmandu is home to [[Cinema of Nepal|Nepali cinema]] and theatres. The city contains several theatres, including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path, the Ganga Theatre, the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982. The M.

Musical performances are organized in cultural venues. Music is a part of the traditional aspect of Kathmandu. [[Gunla]] is the traditional music festival according to [[Nepal Sambat]]. Newar music originated in Kathmandu. Furthermore, music from all over Nepal can be found in Kathmandu.\n\nA number of [[hippie]]s visited Kathmandu during the 1970s and introduced [[Rock and Roll|rock and roll]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[jazz]] to the city. Kathmandu is noted internationally for its [[jazz]] festival, popularly known as [[Jazzmandu]]. It is the only jazz festival in the Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide, such as [[Australia]], [[Denmark]], [[United States]], [[Benin]], and [[India]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe city has been referenced in numerous songs, including works by [[Cat Stevens]] ('Katmandu', ''[[Mona Bone Jakon]]'' (1970)), [[Bob Seger]] ('Katmandu', ''[[Beautiful Loser]]'' (1975)), [[Rush (band)|Rush]] ('[[A Passage to Bangkok]]', ''Pulling into Kathmandu''; ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'', 1976), [[Krematorij]] ('Kathmandu', ''Three Springs'' (2000)), [[Fito P\u00e1ez]] (''Tr\u00e1fico por Katmand\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"Traffic through Kathmandu\") and Cavalcade ('Kathmandu Kid') 2019.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\n[[File:Dalbath.jpg|thumb|One of the typical Nepali meals [[Dal bhat]] in Kathmandu]]\n\nThe staple food of most people in Kathmandu is [[dal bhat]]. This consists of rice and lentil soup, generally served with vegetable curries, achar and sometimes Chutney. [[Momo (food)|Momo]], a type of Nepali version of Tibetan dumpling, has become prominent in Nepal with many street vendors and restaurants selling it. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu. Various Nepali variants of momo including buff (i.e. buffalo) momo, chicken momo, and vegetarian momo are famous in Kathmandu.  <!-- This article is about Kathmandu and most Nepali in Kathmandu have dal bhat as their day to day meal and are able to afford a simple meal of dal bhat and NOT any exotic and other cultural cuisines. Please see the talk regarding this discussion. The local cuisine of Kathmandu as of NOW is dal bhat and the cuisine as local is considered to be what the residents take not what a particular ethnic group takes.-->\n\nMost of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian. However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. ''Buff'' (meat of water buffalo) is very common. There is a strong tradition of ''buff'' consumption in Kathmandu, especially among [[Newar]]s, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims considers it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating ''buff'' as from [[Quran]] while Hindus eat all varieties except Cow's meat as they consider [[Cattle|Cow]] to be a goddess and symbol of purity. The chief lunch/snack for locals and visitors is mostly ''Momo'' or ''Chowmein''.\n\nKathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955.<ref name=\"LP 2003, p.91\">Lonely Planet (2003), pp. 91\u201392</ref> A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened, catering [[Nepali cuisine]], [[Tibetan cuisine]], [[Chinese cuisine]] and [[Indian cuisine]] in particular. Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American [[chop suey]], which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a [[fried egg]] commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine.<ref name=\"LP 2003, p.91\"/> Continental cuisine can be found in selected places.

Traditionally, these festivals were celebrated by Newars. In recent years, these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well. As the capital of the Republic of Nepal, various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu. With mass migration to the city, the cultures of Khas from the west, [[Kirati people|Kirats]] from the east, Bon/Tibetan from the north, and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) Jatra, [[Indra Jatra]], Dashain [[Durga Puja]] festivals, [[Shivratri]] and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporates Hindu traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of the Buddhist religion.\n\nCultural continuity has been maintained for centuries in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities in Kathmandu and the rest of the country. These deities include the [[Ajima]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jwajalapa.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=62 |title=Jwajalapa |access-date=2011-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813075826/http://jwajalapa.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=62 |archive-date=2011-08-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani or Taleju Bhawani)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/03/taleju-bhavani-and-kumari-worship/|title=Taleju Bhavani and Kumari Worship|last=|first=|date=|website=Mahavidya|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livehistoryindia.com/snapshort-histories/2018/09/16/the-goddess-who-went-to-nepal|title=The Goddess Who Went to Nepal|last=|first=|date=|website=Live History India|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> and her other forms : Digu Taleju (or Degu Taleju)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.therisingnepal.org.np/news/25684|title=Reconstruction of Degu Taleju Temple stalled|last=|first=|date=|website=The Rising Nepal|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>  and [[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] (the living goddess).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2015/06/nepal-kumaris-kathmandu-valley/|title=Living Goddesses of Nepal|last=|first=|date=2015-06-01|website=National Geographic Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> The artistic edifices have now become places of worship in the everyday life of the people, therefore a roster is maintained to observe annual festivals.

The [[Pashupatinath Temple]], [[Changu Narayan]] temple (the oldest), and the [[Kasthamandap]] are of particular importance to Hindus. Other notable Hindu temples in Kathmandu and the surrounding valley include [[Bajrayogini Temple]], [[Dakshinkali Temple]], [[Guhyeshwari Temple]], and the Sobha Bhagwati shrine.\n\nThe [[Bagmati]] River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are on the banks of this river. The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the [[Bagmati Zone|Bagmati]] River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n{{Main|Buddhism in Nepal}}\n\nBuddhism started in Kathmandu with the arrival of Buddhist monks during the time of Buddha (c. 563 \u2013 483 BCE<ref name=Cousins>L. S. Cousins (1996), \"[http://indology.info/papers/cousins The dating of the historical Buddha]: a review article\", ''[[Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society]]'' '''(3)6(1)''': 57\u201363.</ref>). They started a forest monastery in [[Sankhu]]. This monastery was renovated by [[Shakya]]s after they fled genocide from [[Virudhaka (raja)|Virudhaka]] (rule: 491\u2013461 BCE).\n\nDuring the Hindu Lichchavi era (c. 400 to 750), various monasteries and orders were created which successively led to the formation of [[Newar Buddhism]], which is still practiced in the primary [[liturgical language]] of Hinduism, [[Sanskrit]].\n\nLegendary Princess [[Bhrikuti]] (7th-century) and artist [[Araniko]] (1245\u20131306 CE) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals and Bahis) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.\n===Islam ===\n{{Main|Islam in Nepal|Nepalese Muslims}}\n\nIslam people pray to Allah on Friday(the day of Namaj) often going to the Jame Masjid, Ghantaghar near Ratnapark.\n[[File:Mosquektm (74).JPG|thumb|Mosquektm (74)]]\n\n=== Kirat Mundhum ===\n{{Main|Kirat Mundhum}}\nKirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous [[animism|animistic]] practices of Nepal. It is practiced by [[Kirat people]]. Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs, such as ancestor worship (worship of Ajima) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin. Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats, such as Pashupatinath, Wanga Akash Bhairabh (Yalambar) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu. Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice [[Mundhum]] in the city.<ref name=\"Broadening the Nepali mind http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-02-02/broadening-the-nepali-mind.html\">{{Cite web | url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-02-02/broadening-the-nepali-mind.html | title=Broadening the Nepali mind}}</ref>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n[[Sikhism]] is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole. An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct. [[Jainism in Nepal|Jainism]] is practiced by a small community. A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar, where Jains practice their faith. According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Baha'is]] of Nepal, there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley. They have a National Office in Shantinagar, Baneshwor. The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu. Islam is practiced in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority, accounting for about 4.2% of the population of Nepal.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches. Christian missionary hospitals, welfare organizations, and schools are also operating. Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies, who had converted to Christianity while in service, on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion. They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu, in particular.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://across.co.nz/NepalChurches.html |title = Churches in Nepal |publisher = Across.co.nz |accessdate = 20 December 2009 }}</ref><ref name =Christ>{{cite web |url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35518.htm |title = US Department of State: Diplomacy in Action |accessdate = 20 December 2009 |publisher = [[US Department of State]] }}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe oldest modern school in Nepal is [[Durbar High School]], and the oldest college, [[Tri Chandra College]], are both in Kathmandu city.

Every year thousands of students from all over Nepal arrive at Kathmandu to get admission in the various schools and colleges.\nOne of the key concerns of educationists and concerned citizens is the massive outflux of students from Nepal to outside Nepal for studies. Every year thousands of students apply for No objection certificates for studying abroad. Consultancy firms specializing in preparing students to go abroad can be found in all prominent locations. The reason for such an outflux range from perceived low quality of education, political instability, fewer opportunities in the job market, opportunities for earning while learning abroad and better job prospects with an international degree.\n\n== Medical colleges ==\n\n[[Institute of Medicine]], the central college of Tribhuwan University is the first medical college of Nepal and is in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $104 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings when compared to other Pixar films were attributed to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, Corey. Arguing with Ian over the map, Corey realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends Corey, who agrees to help her. Corey warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse which can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]]. \n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixies]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=21 February 2020}}</ref>, relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden. \n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse Corey spoke of which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. Corey flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\".

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $104 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings when compared to other Pixar films were attributed to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley\u2019s beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, Corey. Arguing with Ian over the map, Corey realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends Corey, who agrees to help her. Corey warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse which can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]]. \n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixies]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=21 February 2020}}</ref>, relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden. \n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse Corey spoke of which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. Corey flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\".

Ron Hubbard had a complex and changing relationship with psychiatry;  He recalled positive experiences with psychiatrists in his youth and requested psychiatric treatment in adulthood.  By 1948, Hubbard claimed to volunteer in a psychiatric clinic and two years later published \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\".   In 1951, however, Hubbard's wife [[Sara Northrup Hollister]] reportedly consulted psychiatrists who recommended Hubbard be institutionalized;   Thereafter, Hubbard was increasingly hostile towards psychiatry.   \n\nIn 1995, Scientologist Lisa McPherson died at \"Flag Land Base\" after leaving a hospital where she refused psychiatric treatment.  \n\nIn 2005, celebrity Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] achieved notoriety for his public opposition to psychiatry.  \n\n==L. Ron Hubbard and psychiatry==\n[[L. Ron Hubbard]] was an American author of science fiction and fantasy stories.   Hubbard reported many encounters with psychiatrists, from the age of 12 onward.  \n\nDuring World War Two, Hubbard was hospitalized;  In 1947, Hubbard requested psychiatric treatment and the following year moved with his wife to Savannah Georgia where he was reportedly associated with a psychiatric clinic.   \n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published [[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]].   \n\nIn 1951, it was publicly reported that Hubbard's wife Sara had been advised by a psychiatrist that Hubbard should be institutionalized for treatment of paranoid schizophrenia.<ref name=\"Miller184\" />  They divorced, and the following year, Hubbard founded [[Scientology]], an [[Anti-Psychiatry]] religious movement.<ref name=\"scientology\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html|publisher=scientology.org|title=Scientology Beliefs &amp; Practices: What is Scientology? &#124; Scientology's views on the evils of materialism|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | first=Paulette | last=Cooper | authorlink=Paulette Cooper | title=Scientology Versus Medicine in Scandal of Scientology | publisher =Web Edition| year=1997 | url= http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/tsos/sos-16.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last=Mieszkowskii | first=Katharine | title=Scientology's War on Psychiatry | journal=[[Salon.com]] | year=2005 | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1 | access-date=March 14, 2016 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710060622/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1 | archive-date=July 10, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>  \n\n===Overview===\nHubbard's views on psychiatry evolved over time. \n\nHubbard spoke positively of his childhood and teen encounters with psychiatrists in the 1920 and 30s.

Hubbard initially responded by kidnapping Sara; Thereafter he took their daughter and fled to [[Havana]]. After Sara went public with her story, Hubbard returned her daughter. In his final known encounter with a psychiatrist, Hubbard consulted a practitioner in order to rebut public claims of his own mental illness.\n\nThereafter, Hubbard was increasingly hostile towards psychiatry. In the 50s, Hubbard sought to identify \"Subversive\" psychiatrists or other \"Potential Subversives\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar28.html|title=THE ANDERSON REPORT: CHAPTER 28 |author= |date= |website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonyortega.org/2017/04/18/dox-scientology-founder-l-ron-hubbards-nutty-scheme-to-strong-arm-americas-psychologists/#more-39348 |title=DOX: Scientology founder L.

Some, like Thompson and White, would later be remembered favorably -- Hubbard explicitly cited both as sources for his work.<ref>https://www.lermanet.com/cisar/wis/sources.htm</ref> Others, such as Overholser and Center, were the subject of scorn.\n\n====Joseph Cheesman Thompson====\n\nIn 1923, Navy medical doctor and psychoanalyst, [[Joseph Cheesman Thompson|Joseph \"Snake\" Thompson]] reportedly accompanied then-12-year-old L. Ron Hubbard from Seattle to Washington, D.C. According to a recording of Hubbard sharing anecdotes from his life, he considered Thompson to be a \"very great man\" who sparked Hubbard's interest in \"the human mind\". Hubbard said that Thompson told him, \"If it's not true for you, it's not true.\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laGfzYjotbs</ref> Thompson died in 1943, seven years before the publication of ''Dianetics''.\n\nThompson was included in the Acknowledgements section of 1951's [[Science of Survival]], as was William A. White.\n\n====William Alanson White====\n[[File:Center building at Saint Elizabeths, National Photo Company, circa 1909-1932.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Center Building at St. Elizabeths, one of the oldest on the campus, as it appeared in the early 20th century]]\n\n[[William Alanson White]] was an American neurologist and psychiatrist who served as superintendent of [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]].   A letter from the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International to the FBI, dated June 12, 1954, claims that Hubbard was trained by both Joseph Thompson and William Alanson White.<ref>http://www.carolineletkeman.org/c/archives/5169</ref> In a lecture, Hubbard described consulting White about a theoretical calculation of human memory capacity, apparently during Hubbard's university days.<ref>http://www.carolineletkeman.org/c/archives/5182</ref><ref>http://www.carolineletkeman.org/c/archives/7398</ref> White died in 1937, thirteen years before the publication of Dianetics.\n\nFor two years in the 1920s, White opened the doors of St. Elizabeths to [[Alfred Korzybski]], enabling Korzybski to directly study mental illness, research that contributed heavily to Korzybski's 1933 ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics.'' <ref>{{cite book| ref=harv| title=Korzybski: A Biography| author=Kodish| page=262}}</ref> Hubbard cited the relationship between Korzybski and White in his lectures. <ref>http://www.carolineletkeman.org/c/archives/8251</ref>\n\nWhite was included in the Acknowledgements section of 1951's [[Science of Survival]], as was Joseph Thompson.\n\n====\"Walnut Lodge\"====\n[[File:Chestnut Lodge Postcard 1909.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Chestnut Lodge Postcard dated 1909|Hand coloured photographic postcard of Chestnut Lodge Sanitorium postmarked 1909]]\nFor much of the 1920s and 30s, L. Ron Hubbard lived in Washington D.C..<ref>1922-1927,1929-1932</ref> In a 1952 lecture, Hubbard recalls his interaction with staff and patients at a facility specializing in schizophrenia which he calls \"Walnut Lodge\" (presumably [[Chestnut Lodge]]): \n{{quote| there\u2019s a place by the name of Walnut Lodge. I\u2026 I\u2026 They don\u2019t see anything humorous in that, by the way; it\u2019s Walnut Lodge. [...] They\u2026 they\u2026 they sent three people to see, to\u2026 to see me and every one of them was under treatment. And this was their staff. But anyway, very good people there, I\u2019m sure, didn\u2019t happen to meet any. Have some fine patients though. Anyway, they\u2026 they treat only schizophrenia. And so they take only schizophrenics. Now how do they get only schizophrenics?\n\nWell, anybody sent to Walnut Lodge is a classified schizophrenic. And they take somebody who is a [[dementia praecox]] unclassified or a more modern definition, a mania-depressive and they take him from [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Saint Elizabeth\u2019s]] and they take him over to Walnut Lodge and he goes onto the books as a schizophrenic. Why? Because Walnut Lodge takes only schizophrenics.<ref>http://carolineletkeman.org/dsp/1952/12/04/lecture-the-logics-methods-of-thinking-02/</ref>}}\n\nHubbard would return to \"Walnut Lodge\" in future writings. A 1970 bulletin states that \"$2,000 a month for board only is the price at Walnut Lodge in Washington DC, an average place.\"<ref>\"The Psychiatrist At Work\"</ref> In his work [[Mission Earth (novel series)|Mission Earth]], Hubbard writes \"Arginal P.

A letter dated October 15, 1947 which Hubbard wrote to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) begins: \"This is a request for treatment\". The letter continues:\n\n{{quote|After trying and failing for two years to regain my equilibrium in civil life, I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence. My last physician informed me that it might be very helpful if I were to be examined and perhaps treated psychiatrically or even by a psychoanalyst.

I cannot account for nor rise above long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations, and have newly come to realize that I must first triumph above this before I can hope to rehabilitate myself at all. ...

He forbade them to use it but they disagreed heavily and privately used it for many years under cover.

This great pioneer, against the violent objections of medical doctors and the psychiatrists of his day, ventured to put forth the theory that memory was connected with present time behavior\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Technical Bulletin vol I The Analytic Mind</ref> Hubbard elaborated: \"Freud was so thoroughly shunned by neurologists of his day and medicine ever since, that only his great literary skill brought his work as far as it has come.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs late as 1955, Hubbard still identified himself with mental health professions, describing himself as \"a writer, a scientist, and a psychologist\".<ref name=\"tonyortega.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2016/02/21/when-scientology-was-in-trouble-in-1955-l-ron-hubbard-told-prosecutor-he-was-a-psychologist/|title=When Scientology was in trouble in 1955, L.

Upon learning of the plan,  Hubbard initially kidnapped Sara; After her release, Hubbard fled to Havana with their young daughter. Hubbard then underwent a public divorce in which his wife publicly alleged that Hubbard had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  Upon his return to the US, Hubbard consulted with a psychiatrist to rebut public claims of his mental illness.\n\n====Sara consults psychiatrist==== \nIn 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara went to a psychiatrist to obtain advice about his increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, and was told that he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill their daughter Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her. Sara later recalled: \"He didn't want her to be brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils.\"<ref name=\"Wright-71\">[[#Wright|Wright]], p. 71</ref>\n\nIn a letter to the Attorney General dated May 1951, Hubbard claims that on \"Feb. 25  she [Sara] flew to San Francisco and my general managers Jack Maloney in New Jersey received a phone call from her and Miles Hollister and a psychiatrist named [[Meyer Zeligs|Meyer Zelig]] in San Francisco that I had gone insane and that they needed money to incarcerate me quickly.\"<ref>[http://scientology-research.org/letter-from-l-ron-hubbard-to-the-attorney-general-may-14-1951/ scientology-research.org]</ref>\n\nTwo decades later, in 1972, Hubbard would write to followers: {{quote| the NY Times Literary Section began an attack and a lot of violent track ran by which included DR. MEYER-ZELIG, a psychiatrist in San Francisco master-minding a kidnapping of me to fly me to St. Louis and be put away. His (Zelig\u2019s) plans miscarried. MILES HOLLISTER, formerly a psych student, got hold of SARA NORTHRUP (really Komknoidominoff) (or ov) and handed her over to Zelig who put her in deep hypnosis, fixated her on the idea I was trying to kill her and spun her in, in which state she has remained since. This caused the final destruction of the HDRF [Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation] as national press only played up her divorce.<ref>[http://www.carolineletkeman.org/c/archives/5171 carolineletkeman.org] </ref>}}\n\n====Hubbard kidnaps wife; daughter====\nOn the night of February 24, 1951, Hubbard took daughter Alexis while Sara was at a movie theater.  A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Sara, who was now back at her apartment: \"We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us.\"<ref name=\"Wright-72\">[[#Wright|Wright]], p. 72</ref> She was bundled into the back of a car and driven to [[San Bernardino, California]], where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at [[Yuma International Airport|Yuma Airport]] across the state line in [[Arizona]]. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. She agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations.<ref name=\"Atack-117\">[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 117</ref> Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that \"he had cut [Alexis] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him.\"<ref name=\"Wright-72\" />\n\nFrom March to May 1951, Hubbard fled to Havana with his infant daughter. According to his estranged son Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard was under psychiatric care at this time.<ref name=\"tonyortega.org1\"/>\n\n====Public allegation of Hubbard having 'paranoid schizophrenia'====\nAfter her release, Sara filed for divorce, charging Hubbard with causing her \"extreme cruelty, great mental anguish and physical suffering\". Her allegations produced more lurid headlines: not only was Hubbard accused of bigamy and kidnapping, but she had been subjected to \"systematic torture, including loss of sleep, beatings, and strangulations and scientific experiments\". Because of his \"crazy misconduct\" she was in \"hourly fear of both the life of herself and of her infant daughter, who she has not seen for two months\".<ref name=\"Miller184\" />\n\nOn April 23, 1951, it was publicly reported that Sara had consulted doctors who \"concluded that said Hubbard was hopelessly insane, and crazy, and that there was no hope for said Hubbard, or any reason for her to endure further; that competent medical advisers recommended that said Hubbard be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as [[paranoid schizophrenia]].\"<ref name=\"Miller184\">[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 184</ref> The San Francisco Chronicle coverage used the headline \"Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife\".<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/sfchronicle-hubbard-042451.htm lermanet.com]</ref>\n\nHubbard's lover, Barbara Klowden, recorded in her journal:\n<blockquote>\nHe [Hubbard] talked about what he was going to do to psychiatrists.\n\nHow he brought psychotic into present time in psychiatrists office and how that psychiatrist said to him \"If you think you've cured this woman you're crazy. If you claim to cure people by doing that, if you're not careful, we'll lock you up.\" He laughed and laughed.\n\nThen, tearing indignantly at chicken leg, he said \"They all came to me and said I was a psychotic. Hah. They called me a paranoid. Can you imagine?\"\n\nMy blood ran cold as he was saying that and it was all I could do to keep from weeping.

Writes Hubbard: \"Now and then it becomes necessary to eradicate from a new subject things which it has inherited from an old. And only because this has become necessary am I persuaded to tread upon the toes of the \"grandfather\" to Dianetics and Scientology.\" In the essay, Hubbard admits that from \"the earliest beginnings of Dianetics it is possible to trace a considerable psychoanalytic influence.\" Hubbard makes a distinction between Dianetics and Scientology writing that \"Scientology, unlike Dianetics, is not a psychotherapy. It is therefore from the dominance of Scientology rather than from the viewpoint of Dianetics that one can understand the failings of psychoanalysis, its dangers and the reasons why it did not produce what it should have produced.\"\n\n<blockquote>\nWe discover psychoanalysis to have been superseded by tyrannous sadism, practiced by unprincipled men, themselves evidently in the last stages of dementia. This, then, is the end of the trail for psychoanalysis\u2014a world of failure and brutality. Today men who call themselves analysts are merrily sawing out patients\u2019 brains, shocking them with murderous drugs, striking them with high voltages, burying them underneath mounds of ice, placing them in restraints, \u201csterilizing\u201d them sexually and generally conducting themselves much as their patients would were they given the chance. It is up to us to realize, then, that psychoanalysis in its pure practice is dead the moment the spirit of humanity in which Freud developed the work is betrayed by the handing over of a patient to the merciless misconduct which passes today for treatment.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1957, Hubbard founded the \"National Academy of American Psychology\" which sought to issue a \"loyalty oath\" to psychologists and psychiatrists. Those who opposed the oath were to be labelled \"Subversive\" psychiatrists, while those who merely refused to sign the oath would be labelled \"Potentially Subversive\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar28.html|title=THE ANDERSON REPORT: CHAPTER 28|author=|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2017/04/18/dox-scientology-founder-l-ron-hubbards-nutty-scheme-to-strong-arm-americas-psychologists/#more-39348|title=DOX: Scientology founder L.

They are members of the [[Bank of England]] and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up [&hellip;]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters [&hellip;].

He taught that psychiatrists were themselves deeply unethical individuals, committing \"extortion, mayhem and murder. Our files are full of evidence on them.\"<ref name=\"Crime&P\"/><ref name=\"Crime&Psych\"/>\n\nHubbard's efforts to cast the field of psychiatry as the source of all of humanity's problems are exemplified in a policy letter written in 1971, in which he attempted to redefine the word \"psychiatrist\" to mean \"an antisocial enemy of the people\":\n\n<blockquote>''Psychiatry'' and ''psychiatrist'' are easily redefined to mean 'an antisocial enemy of the people.' This takes the kill-crazy psychiatrist off the preferred list of professions. This is a good use of the technique {{interpolation|of redefining words}} as for a century the psychiatrist has been setting an all-time record for inhumanity to Man.<ref>[http://carolineletkeman.org/sp/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=228&Itemid=202] L.

Though they were expelled from the organization after their identity and mission were revealed, the Church of Scientology then filed a number of suits against the NAMH.\n\nWhen [[Operation Snow White]], a Church of Scientology campaign to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L.

It does so for three principal reasons: 1) procedures such as [[electroshock therapy|electro-shock]], [[psychoactive drug|drugs]] and [[lobotomy]] injure, maim and destroy people in the guise of help; 2) psychiatry is not a science and has no proven methods to justify the billions of dollars of government funds that are poured into it; and 3) psychiatric theories that man is a mere animal have been used to rationalize, for example, the wholesale slaughter of human beings in [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faq.scientology.org/psychtry.htm|title=Official Church of Scientology: Religious Beliefs, What is Scientology?, L.

Ron Hubbard from Seattle to Washington, D.C. According to a recording of Hubbard sharing anecdotes from his life, he considered Thompson to be a \"very great man\" who sparked Hubbard's interest in \"the human mind\". Hubbard said that Thompson told him, \"If it's not true for you, it's not true.\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laGfzYjotbs</ref> Thompson died in 1943, seven years before the publication of ''Dianetics''.\n\nThompson was included in the Acknowledgements section of 1951's [[Science of Survival]], as was William A.

Ron Hubbard lived in Washington D.C..<ref>1922-1927,1929-1932</ref> In a 1952 lecture, Hubbard recalls his interaction with staff and patients at a facility specializing in schizophrenia which he calls \"Walnut Lodge\" (presumably [[Chestnut Lodge]]): \n{{quote| there\u2019s a place by the name of Walnut Lodge.

But anyway, very good people there, I\u2019m sure, didn\u2019t happen to meet any. Have some fine patients though. Anyway, they\u2026 they treat only schizophrenia. And so they take only schizophrenics. Now how do they get only schizophrenics?\n\nWell, anybody sent to Walnut Lodge is a classified schizophrenic. And they take somebody who is a [[dementia praecox]] unclassified or a more modern definition, a mania-depressive and they take him from [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Saint Elizabeth\u2019s]] and they take him over to Walnut Lodge and he goes onto the books as a schizophrenic. Why? Because Walnut Lodge takes only schizophrenics.<ref>http://carolineletkeman.org/dsp/1952/12/04/lecture-the-logics-methods-of-thinking-02/</ref>}}\n\nHubbard would return to \"Walnut Lodge\" in future writings.

A letter dated October 15, 1947 which Hubbard wrote to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) begins: \"This is a request for treatment\". The letter continues:\n\n{{quote|After trying and failing for two years to regain my equilibrium in civil life, I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence.

This great pioneer, against the violent objections of medical doctors and the psychiatrists of his day, ventured to put forth the theory that memory was connected with present time behavior\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Technical Bulletin vol I The Analytic Mind</ref> Hubbard elaborated: \"Freud was so thoroughly shunned by neurologists of his day and medicine ever since, that only his great literary skill brought his work as far as it has come.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs late as 1955, Hubbard still identified himself with mental health professions, describing himself as \"a writer, a scientist, and a psychologist\".<ref name=\"tonyortega.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2016/02/21/when-scientology-was-in-trouble-in-1955-l-ron-hubbard-told-prosecutor-he-was-a-psychologist/|title=When Scientology was in trouble in 1955, L.

Upon learning of the plan,  Hubbard initially kidnapped Sara; After her release, Hubbard fled to Havana with their young daughter. Hubbard then underwent a public divorce in which his wife publicly alleged that Hubbard had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  Upon his return to the US, Hubbard consulted with a psychiatrist to rebut public claims of his mental illness.\n\n====Sara consults psychiatrist==== \nIn 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara went to a psychiatrist to obtain advice about his increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, and was told that he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill their daughter Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her. Sara later recalled: \"He didn't want her to be brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils.\"<ref name=\"Wright-71\">[[#Wright|Wright]], p. 71</ref>\n\nIn a letter to the Attorney General dated May 1951, Hubbard claims that on \"Feb. 25  she [Sara] flew to San Francisco and my general managers Jack Maloney in New Jersey received a phone call from her and Miles Hollister and a psychiatrist named [[Meyer Zeligs|Meyer Zelig]] in San Francisco that I had gone insane and that they needed money to incarcerate me quickly.\"<ref>[http://scientology-research.org/letter-from-l-ron-hubbard-to-the-attorney-general-may-14-1951/ scientology-research.org]</ref>\n\nTwo decades later, in 1972, Hubbard would write to followers: {{quote| the NY Times Literary Section began an attack and a lot of violent track ran by which included DR. MEYER-ZELIG, a psychiatrist in San Francisco master-minding a kidnapping of me to fly me to St. Louis and be put away. His (Zelig\u2019s) plans miscarried. MILES HOLLISTER, formerly a psych student, got hold of SARA NORTHRUP (really Komknoidominoff) (or ov) and handed her over to Zelig who put her in deep hypnosis, fixated her on the idea I was trying to kill her and spun her in, in which state she has remained since. This caused the final destruction of the HDRF [Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation] as national press only played up her divorce.<ref>[http://www.carolineletkeman.org/c/archives/5171 carolineletkeman.org] </ref>}}\n\n====Hubbard kidnaps wife; daughter====\nOn the night of February 24, 1951, Hubbard took daughter Alexis while Sara was at a movie theater.  A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Sara, who was now back at her apartment: \"We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us.\"<ref name=\"Wright-72\">[[#Wright|Wright]], p. 72</ref> She was bundled into the back of a car and driven to [[San Bernardino, California]], where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at [[Yuma International Airport|Yuma Airport]] across the state line in [[Arizona]]. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. She agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations.<ref name=\"Atack-117\">[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 117</ref> Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that \"he had cut [Alexis] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him.\"<ref name=\"Wright-72\" />\n\nFrom March to May 1951, Hubbard fled to Havana with his infant daughter. According to his estranged son Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard was under psychiatric care at this time.<ref name=\"tonyortega.org1\"/>\n\n====Public allegation of Hubbard having 'paranoid schizophrenia'====\nAfter her release, Sara filed for divorce, charging Hubbard with causing her \"extreme cruelty, great mental anguish and physical suffering\". Her allegations produced more lurid headlines: not only was Hubbard accused of bigamy and kidnapping, but she had been subjected to \"systematic torture, including loss of sleep, beatings, and strangulations and scientific experiments\". Because of his \"crazy misconduct\" she was in \"hourly fear of both the life of herself and of her infant daughter, who she has not seen for two months\".<ref name=\"Miller184\" />\n\nOn April 23, 1951, it was publicly reported that Sara had consulted doctors who \"concluded that said Hubbard was hopelessly insane, and crazy, and that there was no hope for said Hubbard, or any reason for her to endure further; that competent medical advisers recommended that said Hubbard be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as [[paranoid schizophrenia]].\"<ref name=\"Miller184\">[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 184</ref> The San Francisco Chronicle coverage used the headline \"Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife\".<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/sfchronicle-hubbard-042451.htm lermanet.com]</ref>\n\nHubbard's lover, Barbara Klowden, recorded in her journal:\n<blockquote>\nHe [Hubbard] talked about what he was going to do to psychiatrists.\n\nHow he brought psychotic into present time in psychiatrists office and how that psychiatrist said to him \"If you think you've cured this woman you're crazy. If you claim to cure people by doing that, if you're not careful, we'll lock you up.\" He laughed and laughed.\n\nThen, tearing indignantly at chicken leg, he said \"They all came to me and said I was a psychotic. Hah. They called me a paranoid. Can you imagine?\"\n\nMy blood ran cold as he was saying that and it was all I could do to keep from weeping.

Writes Hubbard: \"Now and then it becomes necessary to eradicate from a new subject things which it has inherited from an old. And only because this has become necessary am I persuaded to tread upon the toes of the \"grandfather\" to Dianetics and Scientology.\" In the essay, Hubbard admits that from \"the earliest beginnings of Dianetics it is possible to trace a considerable psychoanalytic influence.\" Hubbard makes a distinction between Dianetics and Scientology writing that \"Scientology, unlike Dianetics, is not a psychotherapy. It is therefore from the dominance of Scientology rather than from the viewpoint of Dianetics that one can understand the failings of psychoanalysis, its dangers and the reasons why it did not produce what it should have produced.\"\n\n<blockquote>\nWe discover psychoanalysis to have been superseded by tyrannous sadism, practiced by unprincipled men, themselves evidently in the last stages of dementia. This, then, is the end of the trail for psychoanalysis\u2014a world of failure and brutality. Today men who call themselves analysts are merrily sawing out patients\u2019 brains, shocking them with murderous drugs, striking them with high voltages, burying them underneath mounds of ice, placing them in restraints, \u201csterilizing\u201d them sexually and generally conducting themselves much as their patients would were they given the chance. It is up to us to realize, then, that psychoanalysis in its pure practice is dead the moment the spirit of humanity in which Freud developed the work is betrayed by the handing over of a patient to the merciless misconduct which passes today for treatment.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1957, Hubbard founded the \"National Academy of American Psychology\" which sought to issue a \"loyalty oath\" to psychologists and psychiatrists. Those who opposed the oath were to be labelled \"Subversive\" psychiatrists, while those who merely refused to sign the oath would be labelled \"Potentially Subversive\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar28.html|title=THE ANDERSON REPORT: CHAPTER 28|author=|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2017/04/18/dox-scientology-founder-l-ron-hubbards-nutty-scheme-to-strong-arm-americas-psychologists/#more-39348|title=DOX: Scientology founder L.

They are members of the [[Bank of England]] and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world that had sprung up [&hellip;]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters [&hellip;]. These fellows have gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, income tax, government finance&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;[[Harold Wilson|{{interpolation|Harold}} Wilson]], for instance, the current Premier of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing else actually.<ref>[http://solitarytrees.net.silver.alphamegahosting.com/cowen/misc/psywar.htm] Ron's Journal '67 (RJ67).</ref></blockquote>\n\nReferring to psychiatrists as \"psychs\", Hubbard wrote of psychiatrists as denying human spirituality and peddling fake cures. He taught that psychiatrists were themselves deeply unethical individuals, committing \"extortion, mayhem and murder. Our files are full of evidence on them.\"<ref name=\"Crime&P\"/><ref name=\"Crime&Psych\"/>\n\nHubbard's efforts to cast the field of psychiatry as the source of all of humanity's problems are exemplified in a policy letter written in 1971, in which he attempted to redefine the word \"psychiatrist\" to mean \"an antisocial enemy of the people\":\n\n<blockquote>''Psychiatry'' and ''psychiatrist'' are easily redefined to mean 'an antisocial enemy of the people.' This takes the kill-crazy psychiatrist off the preferred list of professions. This is a good use of the technique {{interpolation|of redefining words}} as for a century the psychiatrist has been setting an all-time record for inhumanity to Man.<ref>[http://carolineletkeman.org/sp/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=228&Itemid=202] L.

Though they were expelled from the organization after their identity and mission were revealed, the Church of Scientology then filed a number of suits against the NAMH.\n\nWhen [[Operation Snow White]], a Church of Scientology campaign to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L.

It does so for three principal reasons: 1) procedures such as [[electroshock therapy|electro-shock]], [[psychoactive drug|drugs]] and [[lobotomy]] injure, maim and destroy people in the guise of help; 2) psychiatry is not a science and has no proven methods to justify the billions of dollars of government funds that are poured into it; and 3) psychiatric theories that man is a mere animal have been used to rationalize, for example, the wholesale slaughter of human beings in [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faq.scientology.org/psychtry.htm|title=Official Church of Scientology: Religious Beliefs, What is Scientology?, L.
