Their identity also attracts notable controversy, being that the Cambodian sets are notoriously influential and decorated as their own faction of Crips that is, among other things, racially or ethnically distinct.\n\nAlthough the Asian Boyz gang comprise their own identity as an organization, the identity itself is largely interpreted as an umbrella of individual Crip gangs or \"sets\"; hence their alternative monikers \"Asian Crips\" and \"Asian Boyz Crip\". Though the relationships between these individual sets are unclear, the various Southeast Asian members tend to work with people of their own national, ethnic or cultural background. More recent publications (since 2011) have revealed even more information about the gang, notable details include the alliance of a number of gangs based in Long Beach, California referred to as SEAs, an abbreviation of Suicidal Town, Exotic Family City Crip and Asian boyz.\n\n===Notable crimes===\n\nIn 1990-1991, Pierre Mercado was responsible for four murders, in an attempt to intimidate other gangs.

Their identity also attracts notable controversy, being that the Cambodian sets are notoriously influential and decorated as their own faction of Crips that is, among other things, racially or ethnically distinct.\n\nAlthough the Asian Boyz gang comprise their own identity as an organization, the identity itself is largely interpreted as an umbrella of individual Crip gangs or \"sets\"; hence their alternative monikers \"Asian Crips\" and \"Asian Boyz Crip\". Though the relationships between these individual sets are unclear, the various Southeast Asian members tend to work with people of their own national, ethnic or cultural background.

The songs \"Jhumka Gira Re\", \"Naino Mein Badara Chhaye\" and \"Tu Jahan Jahan Chalega\" became super-hits.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThakur Rakesh Singh ([[Sunil Dutt]]), an affluent descendant of the royalty, is a lawyer and happily married to Geeta ([[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]]) for three years. He goes to London for higher studies and after one year receives the news of his wife's illness. He immediately comes back only to witness his wife's death in his hands. He builds a small memorial in her memory in his mansion. He deeply mourns her by always sitting at that memorial and listening to recorded songs sung by Geeta.\n\nWhile things are like this, one day a police inspector Daljit comes to meet him. He explains to him about the bandit they caught on the other day, Raina ([[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]]) who claims to be the wife of Rakesh. Rakesh meets her and gets shocked as she looks exactly like Geeta. But he rejects that she was his wife as he saw his wife dying and buried her with his own hands. But that woman claims that she was indeed Geeta and tells him about intimate moments they shared. Rakesh gets surprised but suspects some mischief.\n\nThe case proceeds in the court and Rakesh starts to cross-examine that woman. She answers every question correctly and claims that she was kidnapped by someone two to three days before her arrest. When Rakesh asks why she has no [[mangala sutra]] on her, which was a compulsory ornament for married Hindu women, she tells him that she removed it before going out on that day. He wouldn't believe that, as Geeta would consider mangala sutra very sacred and wouldn't have removed it.\n\nAfter some drama, he asks her about her diary, which Geeta always keeps near to her and she fails to answer. He decides that she was just an impostor and asks the court to convict her. She becomes emotionally unstable after all this drama and ends up in a mental institute. One night, she escapes from there and comes to Rakesh's house. There, she explains to Rakesh all that has happened.\n\nGeeta had a twin sister named Nisha, who was a bandit just like their mother. Geeta hides the fact about her criminal family and marries Rakesh. But one day her sister comes to her in a pitiable condition and asks her to give her shelter for one night. Geeta, seeing her sick get out of her house to buy medicine. But she doesn't want other family members to know about Nisha and makes Nisha dress up just like her and even gives her own mangalsutra to Nisha. But when she comes out, Ranjit singh, Nisha's husband ([[Prem Chopra]]) mistakes her for Nisha and takes her away without giving her a chance to talk. When Ranjit Singh comes to know that she wasn't Nisha, he wants to take her back, but police arrest them on their way back. While she was explaining all this to Rakesh, Ranjit Singh comes there and confirms her story. Police shoot him and he dies at Nisha's memorial. Rakesh and Geeta reconcile and start their regular life.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sunil Dutt]] as Thakur Rakesh Singh\n* [[Sadhana Shivdasani]] as Geeta / Raina (aka Nisha)\n* [[Shivraj]] as Family Doctor\n* [[K.N.

The songs \"Jhumka Gira Re\", \"Naino Mein Badara Chhaye\" and \"Tu Jahan Jahan Chalega\" became super-hits.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThakur Rakesh Singh ([[Sunil Dutt]]), an affluent descendant of the royalty, is a lawyer and happily married to Geeta ([[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]]) for three years. He goes to London for higher studies and after one year receives the news of his wife's illness. He immediately comes back only to witness his wife's death in his hands. He builds a small memorial in her memory in his mansion. He deeply mourns her by always sitting at that memorial and listening to recorded songs sung by Geeta.\n\nWhile things are like this, one day a police inspector Daljit comes to meet him. He explains to him about the bandit they caught on the other day, Raina ([[Sadhana Shivdasani|Sadhana]]) who claims to be the wife of Rakesh. Rakesh meets her and gets shocked as she looks exactly like Geeta. But he rejects that she was his wife as he saw his wife dying and buried her with his own hands. But that woman claims that she was indeed Geeta and tells him about intimate moments they shared. Rakesh gets surprised but suspects some mischief.\n\nThe case proceeds in the court and Rakesh starts to cross-examine that woman. She answers every question correctly and claims that she was kidnapped by someone two to three days before her arrest. When Rakesh asks why she has no [[mangala sutra]] on her, which was a compulsory ornament for married Hindu women, she tells him that she removed it before going out on that day. He wouldn't believe that, as Geeta would consider mangala sutra very sacred and wouldn't have removed it.\n\nAfter some drama, he asks her about her diary, which Geeta always keeps near to her and she fails to answer. He decides that she was just an impostor and asks the court to convict her. She becomes emotionally unstable after all this drama and ends up in a mental institute. One night, she escapes from there and comes to Rakesh's house. There, she explains to Rakesh all that has happened.\n\nGeeta had a twin sister named Nisha, who was a bandit just like their mother. Geeta hides the fact about her criminal family and marries Rakesh. But one day her sister comes to her in a pitiable condition and asks her to give her shelter for one night. Geeta, seeing her sick get out of her house to buy medicine. But she doesn't want other family members to know about Nisha and makes Nisha dress up just like her and even gives her own mangalsutra to Nisha. But when she comes out, Ranjit singh, Nisha's husband ([[Prem Chopra]]) mistakes her for Nisha and takes her away without giving her a chance to talk. When Ranjit Singh comes to know that she wasn't Nisha, he wants to take her back, but police arrest them on their way back. While she was explaining all this to Rakesh, Ranjit Singh comes there and confirms her story. Police shoot him and he dies at Nisha's memorial. Rakesh and Geeta reconcile and start their regular life.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sunil Dutt]] as Thakur Rakesh Singh\n* [[Sadhana Shivdasani]] as Geeta / Raina (aka Nisha)\n* [[Shivraj]] as Family Doctor\n* [[K.N. Singh]] as Prosecuting Lawyer\n* [[Anwar Hussain]] as Inspector Daljit\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Daku Suryavar Singh / Ranjit Singh\n* [[Manmohan]] as Doctor (in mental hospital)\n* [[Dhumal]] as Bankeji\n* [[Mukri]] as Munshiji\n* [[Jagdish Sethi]] as Judge\n\n== Music ==\nThe music for the film is composed by [[Madan Mohan (music director)|Madan Mohan]]. The song \"Nainon Mein Badra Chhaaye\" which is based on Raag [[Bhimpalasi]] and sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] has a rendition of [[Sitar]] and won Madan Mohan the \"Sur Singar\" Award for the best classical song for the year 1966.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The haunting title song \"Tu Jahaan Jahaan Chalegaa, Mera Saaya Saath Hoga\" appears twice in the film. [[Asha Bhosle]]'s song \"Jhumkaa Gira Re\" also became very popular.\n\nAll lyrics were written by [[Raja Mehdi Ali Khan]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! #\n! Title\n! Singer(s)\n!

It is used to make most fluorine-containing compounds; examples include the commonly used pharmaceutical antidepressant medication [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) and the  material [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] (Teflon).  Elemental [[fluorine]] is produced from it. Solutions of HF are colourless, [[Acid|acidic]] and highly [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]]. It is commonly used to [[Etching (microfabrication)|etch]] glass and silicon wafers.\n\nWhen hydrofluoric acid comes into contact with human skin it causes deep burns.\n\n==Uses==\n===Production of organofluorine compounds===\nThe principal use of hydrofluoric acid is in [[organofluorine chemistry]]. Many [[organofluorine compounds]] are prepared using HF as the fluorine source, including [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[fluoropolymer]]s, [[fluorocarbon]]s, and [[refrigeration|refrigerants]] such as [[freon]].  Many pharmaceuticals contain fluorine.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Production of inorganic fluorides===\nMost high-volume inorganic fluoride compounds are prepared from hydrofluoric acid.  Foremost are Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>, [[cryolite]], and AlF<sub>3</sub>, [[aluminium trifluoride]].  A molten mixture of these solids serves as a high-temperature solvent for the production of metallic [[aluminium]].  Other inorganic fluorides prepared from hydrofluoric acid include [[sodium fluoride]] and [[uranium hexafluoride]].<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Etchant, cleaner===\n[[File:Wet etching tanks at LAAS (6 inches) 0468.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.4|Wet etching tanks]]\nIt is used in the [[semiconductor]] industry as a major component of [[Wright Etch]] and [[buffered oxide etch]], which are used to clean [[silicon wafer]]s. In a similar manner it is also used to [[Glass etching|etch glass]] by treatment with [[silicon dioxide]] to form gaseous or water-soluble silicon fluorides. It can also be used to polish and frost glass.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n:SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4 HF \u2192 [[Silicon tetrafluoride|SiF<sub>4</sub>]](g) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n:SiO<sub>2</sub> + 6 HF \u2192 [[Hexafluorosilicic acid|H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>]] + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nA 5% to 9% hydrofluoric acid gel is also commonly used to etch all ceramic dental restorations to improve bonding.<ref>{{cite book | last=Craig | first=Robert | title=Craig's restorative dental materials | publisher=Mosby Elsevier | location=St. Louis, Mo | year=2006 | isbn=0-323-03606-6 | oclc=68207297}}<!-- Powers, John M. and Sakaguchi, Ronald L.

Hydrofluoric acid is also useful for dissolving rock samples (usually powdered) prior to analysis. In similar manner, this acid is used in [[acid maceration]]s to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks.  Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a [[cellulose nitrate]] film may be applied (dissolved in [[amyl acetate]]), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it.<ref name=Edwards1982>{{Cite journal\n| last = Edwards | first =  D.\n| year = 1982\n| title = Fragmentary non-vascular plant microfossils from the late Silurian of Wales\n| journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society\n| volume = 84\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 223\u2013256\n| doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.1982.tb00536.x\n}}</ref>\n\n===Oil refining===\nIn a standard [[oil refinery]] process known as [[alkylation]], [[isobutane]] is alkylated with low-molecular-weight [[alkene]]s (primarily a mixture of [[propylene]] and [[butylene]]) in the presence of an acid [[catalyst]] derived from hydrofluoric acid.

It is used to make most fluorine-containing compounds; examples include the commonly used pharmaceutical antidepressant medication [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) and the  material [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] (Teflon).  Elemental [[fluorine]] is produced from it. Solutions of HF are colourless, acidic and highly corrosive. It is commonly used to etch glass and silicon wafers.\n\nWhen hydrofluoric acid comes into contact with human skin it causes deep burns.\n\n==Uses==\n===Production of organofluorine compounds===\nThe principal use of hydrofluoric acid is in [[organofluorine chemistry]]. Many [[organofluorine compounds]] are prepared using HF as the fluorine source, including [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[fluoropolymer]]s, [[fluorocarbon]]s, and [[refrigeration|refrigerants]] such as [[freon]].  Many pharmaceuticals contain fluorine.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Production of inorganic fluorides===\nMost high-volume inorganic fluoride compounds are prepared from hydrofluoric acid.  Foremost are Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>, [[cryolite]], and AlF<sub>3</sub>, [[aluminium trifluoride]].

Apatite sources typically contain a few percent of [[fluoroapatite]], acid digestion of which releases a gaseous stream consisting of [[sulfur dioxide]] (from the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), water, and HF, as well as particulates.  After separation from the solids, the gases are treated with sulfuric acid and [[oleum]] to afford [[anhydrous]] HF.  Owing to the corrosive nature of HF, its production is accompanied by the dissolution of silicate minerals, and, in this way, significant amounts of [[fluorosilicic acid]] are generated.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==Health and safety==\n[[File:61569264 jamesheilman-224x2991.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A hydrofluoric acid burn of the hand]]\n{{Main|Hydrofluoric acid burn}}\n\n{{Refimprove|several sources in this section seem to fail [[WP:MEDRS]]|date=November 2019}}\nIn addition to being a highly [[corrosive]] liquid, hydrofluoric acid is also a powerful contact [[poison]].
