The years have passed\u2026 (and) Mancini has continued to fight against a narrow figurative culture, to criticise and to seek''\"...<ref>L. Leonardi'', Presentazione della mostra del Pittore Romeo Mancini'' (''lit.''

Zappia, Romeo Mancini, 1989, Electa Editori Umbri Associati, translated into English by Liam Boyle</ref>\n\nLeonardi and Mancini both had an aversion to fascism and both later joined the partisans: Leonardi in Rome, and Mancini in Umbria, in the Colfiorito mountains, where he joined the Innamorati Brigade with Enzo Rossi.<ref>R. Mancini, ''La Banda,'' in ''Antifascismo e resistenza nella provincia di Perugia,'' a cura di L. Cappuccelli, Perugia, 1975</ref> When the war ended, Mancini returned to Perugia.\n\nThe early works of [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] and [[Mario Mafai]] appear to have been his points of reference for the ''Autoritratto'' (''lit''. Self-portrait) dated 1943, followed by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] in such works as the ''Gilet Rosso'' (''lit.'' The Red Waistcoat).<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1948, his sketch presented as part of the competition organized by the Sagra Musicale Umbra, along with three other contenders, was chosen as the official poster for the music festival that year.<ref>\"Il Nuovo Corriere\", s.a. ''Questo sar\u00e0 il cartello della Sagra'', 1948</ref> In the same period, Mancini obtained a notable commission: a fresco to be painted using the technique of the ancient masters, \u201con fresh plaster, using first a cartoon and then pouncing\u201d, in Luisa Spagnoli's former headquarters.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nAfter that, he travelled to Paris. Mancini left Perugia taking  with him some photos of his recent works. While in France he immediately came into contact.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> with \u00c9douard Pignon, heir to the tradition of C\u00e9zanne and Picasso.\n\n== Villa Massimo ==\nWhen he came back to Italy, Mancini decided to leave Perugia that not only Leoncillo, Rossi and Brunori, had also done. He chose to follow his group of friends and colleagues to [[Villa Massimo]] in Rome. Here, from 1948, a small group of left-wing Italian painters and sculptors had settled and arranged their own home-atelier in the building that had hosted the German Academy in Rome before the war.<ref>Joachim Bluher e Angela Windholz ''Si torna all'arcadia! La \u201cguerra fredda\u201d per Villa Massimo e la sua consegna alla Repubblica federale di Germania nel 1956,'' Accademia tedesca di Roma, 2006</ref>\n\nMancini had his first exhibition in Rome at Lo Zodiaco Gallery<ref name=\"auto1\"/> in 1950. He exhibited about twenty paintings at Lo Zodiaco.\n\nThe exhibition also included the ''Minatore'' (''lit.'' The Miner), that the following year the painter also sent to the \u201cPremi per la Pace\u201d (''lit.'' Peace Prize) contest organized by the \u201cRinascita\u201d and \u201cVie Nuove\u201d magazines. The panel was composed of the communist editors of the magazines that promoted the event, [[Palmiro Togliatti]] and [[Luigi Longo]], and [[Pietro Nenni]], the President of the [[National Liberation Committee]] representing the partisans, and technicians, [[Giulio Carlo Argan]], [[Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli]], [[Roberto Longhi]], Libero De Libero, and Mario Penelope.\n\nThe jury appreciated Mancini's work, but were opposed by Togliatti, who was known to caution artists against supporting neo-cubist ideas from the pages of \u201cRinascita\u201d.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1950 the [[Italian Communist Party]] invited a group of ten young left-wing artists to the Comacchio valleys, which at the time was one of the most deprived areas in the country. Romeo participated, together with Treccani, Turcato, Scarpitta, and the Neapolitan artist Ricci.  The resulting works were exhibited during the Sagra della Fioritura Festival in Vignola, where a jury which included Mazzacurati awarded Mancini with the third prize, consisting of a wheel of Grana Padano cheese.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  Back in his atelier in Villa Massimo, Romeo re-elaborated the sketches made in Comacchio, and transformed them into large oil compositions. Of this group of works, the artist kept two temperas, ''Pescatori in riposo'' (''lit.'' Fishermen at Rest)  and ''Gioco della morra'' (''lit.'' Game of Morra). These two fishermen are the predecessors of the two robots placed side by side that the artist calls ''Cattedrali''<ref name=\"auto1\"/> (''lit.'' Cathedrals).\n\nThe 1950s were the central years of Romeo's activity, including abroad. In 1953 he participated in the International Youth Festival in Warsaw with his work the ''Fiocinatore'' (''lit.'' Harpooner) which earned him the second prize.<ref>Articolo di giornale s.a., Vivo successo ottenuto alla mostra di Mancini, 1953</ref>\n\nIn 1951 ''Minatori'' was the painting chosen by Mancini to participate in the VI Rome Quadriennale .\n\nIn November 1956 Romeo was invited at the [[Venice Biennale|XXVIII edition of the Venice Biennale]].<ref>Catalogo generale della XXVIII Biennale di Venezia, Venezia, 1956</ref>\n\nHere Mancini was presented with two ceramic high reliefs: ''Fiocinatori'' (''lit.'' Harpooners) ''n. 2'' and ''Fiocinatori n. 3'', both created in 1956 and exhibited in Venice in a pavilion designed by [[Carlo Scarpa]].\n\nIn 1956, partially as a result of a smear campaign led by the German press against the artists of Villa Massimo, along with their way of life, the government of that country was able to evict the Italians and reorganize the academy within the villa. Mancini was already no longer living there permanently, due to the many commissions he received in Umbria.<ref>C. Zappia, Romeo Mancini, Electa/Editori Umbri associati, 1989.</ref>\n\n== The Fishermen ==\nMancini married in 1956 with Franca Ottalevi and moved back to Perugia.\n\nIn 1957, Mancini became professor of sculpture at the local Academy of Fine Arts, a position he would hold for more than twenty years. In 1973 Professor Mancini was also appointed director, which saw him undertake the revision of the nineteenth century statute of the Perugia Academy, creating new courses and reorganizing, with the help of the conservator Pietro Scarpellini, the drawings and prints still preserved at the Pietro Vannucci Academy.<ref>This work resulted in the exhibition at Lungara in Rome, which was transferred first to Perugia (Palazzo dei Priori), followed by Spoleto (Municipal Art Gallery) and then Canada. This exhibition was recorded the precious booklet ''Cento Disegni dell'Accademia di Belle Arti di Perugia XVII-XIX sec'' (''lit.'' One hundred XVII-XIX Century Drawings At The Academy of Fine Arts in Perugia), by M.V. Cresti, F. F. Mancini, G. Sapori, Rome 1977.</ref>\n\nReturning then to Perugia in the mid 1950s, Mancini again began to frequent the studio in Via Baldeschi that he had shared with his brother the conservator, before his time in Rome. He remained there preparing the sketches for the monuments to those who died in the war, and also returned to his paintings of fishermen, some Cubist, some realistic.<ref>C.Zappia, ''Romeo Mancini'', Electa/Editori Umbri Associati, 1989</ref>\n\nMancini, however, did not break off all contacts with Rome, organizing regular exhibitions in the capital. In the spring of 1958 he organized a personal exhibition at the Galleria La Salita. In Umbria, where Mancini now resided, in 1959 he participated, resulting in significant recognition, in the first edition of the \"Premio Perugia\" (''lit.'' Perugia Prize).<ref>The jury was composed of G. C. Argan, F. Bellonzi, M. Penelope, B. Saetti, G. Breddo and F. Menzio. The first prize was jointly awarded\tto G. Zingaia and G. De Gregorio, while among the other winners of smaller prizes, apart from Mancini, were E. Brunori, V. Ciardo and P. Raspi.</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Romeo presented himself to the public in Perugia with twenty-seven recent paintings, exhibited between March and April in the Palazzo dei Priori.<ref>G. Angeletti, Successo della personale al Palazzo dei Priori, in \"Il Messaggero\", 1961</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Romero organized personal exhibitions in several U.S. states (Michigan, Indiana, Ohio).\n\nMancini supervised the scenery for The Firebird by Stravinsky at the Teatro Morlacchi<ref>Archivio della Sagra Musicale Umbra che riporta l'anno e la data dell'evento, il 10 agosto del 1958.</ref> in Perugia. The artist found inspiration for this work in the painting ''Antibes'' from the 1950s.\n\nIn 1966 Romeo was also invited to exhibit at the [[Rome Quadriennale|IX Quadriennale]], where he presented two works<ref>S.a. ''Le nostre regioni alla IX Quadriennale di Roma'', in \"Paese Sera\", gennaio 1966</ref> on his usual theme of fishermen, called ''Tempi del'' ''lavoratore del mare'' (''lit.'' Temples of the Workers of the Sea) and II.\n\n== Monuments ==\nMany monuments were commissioned to Mancini in the late 1940s and early 1950s by the municipalities of Umbria.\n\nThe municipality of Pietralunga commissioned a plastic and dense bronze monument with figures to commemorate their dead (1948). Here the artist seems to have been heavily influenced<ref>C. Zappia. Romeo Mancini, Electa/Editori Umbri Associati, 1989</ref> by Mazzacurati, following the outline already established in 1942 with ''la Strage degli innocenti (lit''. the Slaughter of the Innocents'')'', which he would continue to repeat during the same period.\n\nA reminder of Cubism emerges again in the large ''Monumento ai Caduti di tutte le guerre''<ref>S.a., ''Domenica si inaugura il monumento ai Caduti di Passignano opera dello scultore Romeo Mancini'', 1957.</ref> ''(lit.'' Monument to the Fallen of All Wars'')''1956, in Passignano, Perugia, which consists of a colourful ceramic frieze, mounted in a grey stone frame.\n\nThe study and construction of this monument took Mancini at least two years of work. A group of studies for the various component parts was presented at the Brufani exhibition in Perugia of 1953.\n\nCastiglione del Lago also wanted a monument to their dead, and Romeo created a large composition in bronze bas-relief in which, on a barely sketched background of the city,<ref>Palazzo della Corgna, which stands on the square in Castiglione del Lago, is however recognizable.</ref> there stands a turreted figure of Italy, that observes the scene of a mother bent over the body of her son, who has died for his country. The sculpture, cast in Verona, was inaugurated with a solemn ceremony in November 1956, by which time Romeo was already officially and internationally recognized as a sculptor, presenting himself as such at the XXVIII edition of the [[Venice Biennale]].\n\nIn 1958 he realized the monument to the Partisan of Montebuono,<ref>s.a., Inaugurato il monumento ai partigiani di Agello, in \"L'Unit\u00e0\", 10 giugno 1958</ref> Agello, Perugia.\n\nIn 1961, when he was asked to create a visualization of Perugia for the great exhibition in Turin, \u201cItalia '61\u201d. The work modelled in ceramic with an operation of synthesis and abstraction, recalls, thanks to the precious material, the golden glow of ancient sun baked Etruscan stones and, through synthetic and sharp forms, suggests the idea of the urban development of the medieval city. The sculpture was prepared by Mancini for the stand designed by the architects representing Umbria, Astengo, Zanetti and Campus, at of the great Turin exhibition.<ref>G. Angeletti, Sono quasi pronte le imponenti opere per lo stand umbro alla mostra \"Italia '61\", aprile 1961</ref>\n\nIn 1962 he realized the sculpture Dedicata al lavoratore (''lit.'' Dedicated to the Worker), executed for the fountain in Piazza d'Anni at S. Giuliana in Perugia.\n\nIn 1967 he created the great ''Scultura in acciaio'' (''lit.'' Steel Sculpture) for Citt\u00e0 della Pieve and the ''Aerei'' (''lit.'' Aircraft), also in steel, to commemorate the dead in Passignano, on lake Trasimeno.\n\nIn the same year, the sculpture ''Icone 67'' was sent to Alexandria in Egypt. The Venice Biennale had organized an exhibition of twelve artists in the city, and Mancini, on the recommendation of Valentino Martinelli, was invited to exhibit two sculptures and two paintings. At this time, the artist designed abstract works, clearly destined to live in the open air, in the interplay of natural light and his figures of fishermen or workers.\n\nIn 1984 Mancini produced works such as the sculpture in memory of ''Capitini'' one dedicated to the ''Fanciullo'' (''lit.'' Young Man), and another dedicated to the ''(Ai Democratici Umbri Vittime dello squadrismo fascista 1921-1922'' (''lit.'' Victims of the fascist squads), all in Perugia.<ref>C. Zappia, ''Romeo Mancini'', Electa/Editori Umbri Associati, 1989.</ref>\n\n== The Cathedrals ==\nIn 1968, Mancini created the first prototypes of the ''Cattedrali per la conquista dello spazio'' (''lit.'' Cathedrals for the Conquest of Space<ref>Compare:\t''Un\timpegno di libert\u00e0 e di pace'' (''lit.''\tA\tcommitment to freedom and peace), exhibition catalogue, Perugia\t1982.</ref>)  that predated his entire output from that point onward date back to this time.\n\nThe use of metallic materials, visits to foundries, the idea that the world is now irrevocably reduced to a giant Meccano set, led Mancini to create a series of large paintings testing himself with a material that was new to him: acrylic. The smooth, cold surface created by this paint composes and decomposes itself, creating a split, sections of mysterious mechanical objects.<ref>C. Zappia, Romeo Mancini, 1989, Electa Editori Umbri Associati</ref>\n\nMancini built new bodies mounted with machine parts that he called ''Cattedrali'' (''lit.'' Cathedrals), but these pieces of machinery, these ''Cattedrali'' in the end always recalled the shape of the human body, or rather of two opposing human bodies. ''Cattedrali'' \u201cin the desert, factories, as places where they concentrate all social value, collectives of positivity and human duration<ref>D. Micacchi, ''Le Cattedrali di Romeo Mancini a Perugia'' (''lit.''\tThe\tCathedrals of Romeo Mancini in Perugia), in \u201cL'Unit\u00e0\u201d, 21 March 1979.</ref>\u201d.\n\n1972 saw a major retrospective at the town hall in Perugia, which featured, as well as older works, a series of more recent sculptures. In 1976, again at the Palazzo dei Priori municipal building in Perugia, Mancini presented the great ''Cattedrali'' in acrylic to the public.\nThis series culminated in 1984 with an exhibition at the Rocca Paolina in Perugia.<ref>C.V.

Zappia, Romeo Mancini, 1989, Electa Editori Umbri Associati, translated into English by Liam Boyle</ref>\n\nLeonardi and Mancini both had an aversion to fascism and both later joined the partisans: Leonardi in Rome, and Mancini in Umbria, in the Colfiorito mountains, where he joined the Innamorati Brigade with Enzo Rossi.<ref>R. Mancini, ''La Banda,'' in ''Antifascismo e resistenza nella provincia di Perugia,'' a cura di L. Cappuccelli, Perugia, 1975</ref> When the war ended, Mancini returned to Perugia.\n\nThe early works of [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] and [[Mario Mafai]] appear to have been his points of reference for the ''Autoritratto'' (''lit''. Self-portrait) dated 1943, followed by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] in such works as the ''Gilet Rosso'' (''lit.'' The Red Waistcoat).<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1948, his sketch presented as part of the competition organized by the Sagra Musicale Umbra, along with three other contenders, was chosen as the official poster for the music festival that year.<ref>\"Il Nuovo Corriere\", s.a. ''Questo sar\u00e0 il cartello della Sagra'', 1948</ref> In the same period, Mancini obtained a notable commission: a fresco to be painted using the technique of the ancient masters, \u201con fresh plaster, using first a cartoon and then pouncing\u201d, in Luisa Spagnoli's former headquarters.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nAfter that, he travelled to Paris. Mancini left Perugia taking  with him some photos of his recent works. While in France he immediately came into contact.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> with \u00c9douard Pignon, heir to the tradition of C\u00e9zanne and Picasso.\n\n== Villa Massimo ==\nWhen he came back to Italy, Mancini decided to leave Perugia that not only Leoncillo, Rossi and Brunori, had also done. He chose to follow his group of friends and colleagues to [[Villa Massimo]] in Rome. Here, from 1948, a small group of left-wing Italian painters and sculptors had settled and arranged their own home-atelier in the building that had hosted the German Academy in Rome before the war.<ref>Joachim Bluher e Angela Windholz ''Si torna all'arcadia! La \u201cguerra fredda\u201d per Villa Massimo e la sua consegna alla Repubblica federale di Germania nel 1956,'' Accademia tedesca di Roma, 2006</ref>\n\nMancini had his first exhibition in Rome at Lo Zodiaco Gallery<ref name=\"auto1\"/> in 1950. He exhibited about twenty paintings at Lo Zodiaco.\n\nThe exhibition also included the ''Minatore'' (''lit.'' The Miner), that the following year the painter also sent to the \u201cPremi per la Pace\u201d (''lit.'' Peace Prize) contest organized by the \u201cRinascita\u201d and \u201cVie Nuove\u201d magazines. The panel was composed of the communist editors of the magazines that promoted the event, [[Palmiro Togliatti]] and [[Luigi Longo]], and [[Pietro Nenni]], the President of the [[National Liberation Committee]] representing the partisans, and technicians, [[Giulio Carlo Argan]], [[Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli]], [[Roberto Longhi]], Libero De Libero, and Mario Penelope.\n\nThe jury appreciated Mancini's work, but were opposed by Togliatti, who was known to caution artists against supporting neo-cubist ideas from the pages of \u201cRinascita\u201d.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1950 the [[Italian Communist Party]] invited a group of ten young left-wing artists to the Comacchio valleys, which at the time was one of the most deprived areas in the country. Romeo participated, together with Treccani, Turcato, Scarpitta, and the Neapolitan artist Ricci.  The resulting works were exhibited during the Sagra della Fioritura Festival in Vignola, where a jury which included Mazzacurati awarded Mancini with the third prize, consisting of a wheel of Grana Padano cheese.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  Back in his atelier in Villa Massimo, Romeo re-elaborated the sketches made in Comacchio, and transformed them into large oil compositions. Of this group of works, the artist kept two temperas, ''Pescatori in riposo'' (''lit.'' Fishermen at Rest)  and ''Gioco della morra'' (''lit.'' Game of Morra). These two fishermen are the predecessors of the two robots placed side by side that the artist calls ''Cattedrali''<ref name=\"auto1\"/> (''lit.'' Cathedrals).\n\nThe 1950s were the central years of Romeo's activity, including abroad. In 1953 he participated in the International Youth Festival in Warsaw with his work the ''Fiocinatore'' (''lit.'' Harpooner) which earned him the second prize.<ref>Articolo di giornale s.a., Vivo successo ottenuto alla mostra di Mancini, 1953</ref>\n\nIn 1951 ''Minatori'' was the painting chosen by Mancini to participate in the VI Rome Quadriennale .\n\nIn November 1956 Romeo was invited at the [[Venice Biennale|XXVIII edition of the Venice Biennale]].<ref>Catalogo generale della XXVIII Biennale di Venezia, Venezia, 1956</ref>\n\nHere Mancini was presented with two ceramic high reliefs: ''Fiocinatori'' (''lit.'' Harpooners) ''n. 2'' and ''Fiocinatori n. 3'', both created in 1956 and exhibited in Venice in a pavilion designed by [[Carlo Scarpa]].\n\nIn 1956, partially as a result of a smear campaign led by the German press against the artists of Villa Massimo, along with their way of life, the government of that country was able to evict the Italians and reorganize the academy within the villa. Mancini was already no longer living there permanently, due to the many commissions he received in Umbria.<ref>C. Zappia, Romeo Mancini, Electa/Editori Umbri associati, 1989.</ref>\n\n== The Fishermen ==\nMancini married in 1956 with Franca Ottalevi and moved back to Perugia.\n\nIn 1957, Mancini became professor of sculpture at the local Academy of Fine Arts, a position he would hold for more than twenty years. In 1973 Professor Mancini was also appointed director, which saw him undertake the revision of the nineteenth century statute of the Perugia Academy, creating new courses and reorganizing, with the help of the conservator Pietro Scarpellini, the drawings and prints still preserved at the Pietro Vannucci Academy.<ref>This work resulted in the exhibition at Lungara in Rome, which was transferred first to Perugia (Palazzo dei Priori), followed by Spoleto (Municipal Art Gallery) and then Canada. This exhibition was recorded the precious booklet ''Cento Disegni dell'Accademia di Belle Arti di Perugia XVII-XIX sec'' (''lit.'' One hundred XVII-XIX Century Drawings At The Academy of Fine Arts in Perugia), by M.V. Cresti, F. F. Mancini, G. Sapori, Rome 1977.</ref>\n\nReturning then to Perugia in the mid 1950s, Mancini again began to frequent the studio in Via Baldeschi that he had shared with his brother the conservator, before his time in Rome. He remained there preparing the sketches for the monuments to those who died in the war, and also returned to his paintings of fishermen, some Cubist, some realistic.<ref>C.Zappia, ''Romeo Mancini'', Electa/Editori Umbri Associati, 1989</ref>\n\nMancini, however, did not break off all contacts with Rome, organizing regular exhibitions in the capital. In the spring of 1958 he organized a personal exhibition at the Galleria La Salita. In Umbria, where Mancini now resided, in 1959 he participated, resulting in significant recognition, in the first edition of the \"Premio Perugia\" (''lit.'' Perugia Prize).<ref>The jury was composed of G. C. Argan, F. Bellonzi, M. Penelope, B. Saetti, G. Breddo and F. Menzio. The first prize was jointly awarded\tto G. Zingaia and G. De Gregorio, while among the other winners of smaller prizes, apart from Mancini, were E. Brunori, V. Ciardo and P. Raspi.</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Romeo presented himself to the public in Perugia with twenty-seven recent paintings, exhibited between March and April in the Palazzo dei Priori.<ref>G. Angeletti, Successo della personale al Palazzo dei Priori, in \"Il Messaggero\", 1961</ref>\n\nIn 1963 Romero organized personal exhibitions in several U.S. states (Michigan, Indiana, Ohio).\n\nMancini supervised the scenery for The Firebird by Stravinsky at the Teatro Morlacchi<ref>Archivio della Sagra Musicale Umbra che riporta l'anno e la data dell'evento, il 10 agosto del 1958.</ref> in Perugia. The artist found inspiration for this work in the painting ''Antibes'' from the 1950s.\n\nIn 1966 Romeo was also invited to exhibit at the [[Rome Quadriennale|IX Quadriennale]], where he presented two works<ref>S.a. ''Le nostre regioni alla IX Quadriennale di Roma'', in \"Paese Sera\", gennaio 1966</ref> on his usual theme of fishermen, called ''Tempi del'' ''lavoratore del mare'' (''lit.'' Temples of the Workers of the Sea) and II.\n\n== Monuments ==\nMany monuments were commissioned to Mancini in the late 1940s and early 1950s by the municipalities of Umbria.\n\nThe municipality of Pietralunga commissioned a plastic and dense bronze monument with figures to commemorate their dead (1948). Here the artist seems to have been heavily influenced<ref>C. Zappia. Romeo Mancini, Electa/Editori Umbri Associati, 1989</ref> by Mazzacurati, following the outline already established in 1942 with ''la Strage degli innocenti (lit''. the Slaughter of the Innocents'')'', which he would continue to repeat during the same period.\n\nA reminder of Cubism emerges again in the large ''Monumento ai Caduti di tutte le guerre''<ref>S.a., ''Domenica si inaugura il monumento ai Caduti di Passignano opera dello scultore Romeo Mancini'', 1957.</ref> ''(lit.'' Monument to the Fallen of All Wars'')''1956, in Passignano, Perugia, which consists of a colourful ceramic frieze, mounted in a grey stone frame.\n\nThe study and construction of this monument took Mancini at least two years of work. A group of studies for the various component parts was presented at the Brufani exhibition in Perugia of 1953.\n\nCastiglione del Lago also wanted a monument to their dead, and Romeo created a large composition in bronze bas-relief in which, on a barely sketched background of the city,<ref>Palazzo della Corgna, which stands on the square in Castiglione del Lago, is however recognizable.</ref> there stands a turreted figure of Italy, that observes the scene of a mother bent over the body of her son, who has died for his country. The sculpture, cast in Verona, was inaugurated with a solemn ceremony in November 1956, by which time Romeo was already officially and internationally recognized as a sculptor, presenting himself as such at the XXVIII edition of the [[Venice Biennale]].\n\nIn 1958 he realized the monument to the Partisan of Montebuono,<ref>s.a., Inaugurato il monumento ai partigiani di Agello, in \"L'Unit\u00e0\", 10 giugno 1958</ref> Agello, Perugia.\n\nIn 1961, when he was asked to create a visualization of Perugia for the great exhibition in Turin, \u201cItalia '61\u201d. The work modelled in ceramic with an operation of synthesis and abstraction, recalls, thanks to the precious material, the golden glow of ancient sun baked Etruscan stones and, through synthetic and sharp forms, suggests the idea of the urban development of the medieval city. The sculpture was prepared by Mancini for the stand designed by the architects representing Umbria, Astengo, Zanetti and Campus, at of the great Turin exhibition.<ref>G. Angeletti, Sono quasi pronte le imponenti opere per lo stand umbro alla mostra \"Italia '61\", aprile 1961</ref>\n\nIn 1962 he realized the sculpture Dedicata al lavoratore (''lit.'' Dedicated to the Worker), executed for the fountain in Piazza d'Anni at S. Giuliana in Perugia.\n\nIn 1967 he created the great ''Scultura in acciaio'' (''lit.'' Steel Sculpture) for Citt\u00e0 della Pieve and the ''Aerei'' (''lit.'' Aircraft), also in steel, to commemorate the dead in Passignano, on lake Trasimeno.\n\nIn the same year, the sculpture ''Icone 67'' was sent to Alexandria in Egypt. The Venice Biennale had organized an exhibition of twelve artists in the city, and Mancini, on the recommendation of Valentino Martinelli, was invited to exhibit two sculptures and two paintings. At this time, the artist designed abstract works, clearly destined to live in the open air, in the interplay of natural light and his figures of fishermen or workers.\n\nIn 1984 Mancini produced works such as the sculpture in memory of ''Capitini'' one dedicated to the ''Fanciullo'' (''lit.'' Young Man), and another dedicated to the ''(Ai Democratici Umbri Vittime dello squadrismo fascista 1921-1922'' (''lit.'' Victims of the fascist squads), all in Perugia.<ref>C. Zappia, ''Romeo Mancini'', Electa/Editori Umbri Associati, 1989.</ref>\n\n== The Cathedrals ==\nIn 1968, Mancini created the first prototypes of the ''Cattedrali per la conquista dello spazio'' (''lit.'' Cathedrals for the Conquest of Space<ref>Compare:\t''Un\timpegno di libert\u00e0 e di pace'' (''lit.''\tA\tcommitment to freedom and peace), exhibition catalogue, Perugia\t1982.</ref>)  that predated his entire output from that point onward date back to this time.\n\nThe use of metallic materials, visits to foundries, the idea that the world is now irrevocably reduced to a giant Meccano set, led Mancini to create a series of large paintings testing himself with a material that was new to him: acrylic. The smooth, cold surface created by this paint composes and decomposes itself, creating a split, sections of mysterious mechanical objects.<ref>C. Zappia, Romeo Mancini, 1989, Electa Editori Umbri Associati</ref>\n\nMancini built new bodies mounted with machine parts that he called ''Cattedrali'' (''lit.'' Cathedrals), but these pieces of machinery, these ''Cattedrali'' in the end always recalled the shape of the human body, or rather of two opposing human bodies. ''Cattedrali'' \u201cin the desert, factories, as places where they concentrate all social value, collectives of positivity and human duration<ref>D. Micacchi, ''Le Cattedrali di Romeo Mancini a Perugia'' (''lit.''\tThe\tCathedrals of Romeo Mancini in Perugia), in \u201cL'Unit\u00e0\u201d, 21 March 1979.</ref>\u201d.\n\n1972 saw a major retrospective at the town hall in Perugia, which featured, as well as older works, a series of more recent sculptures. In 1976, again at the Palazzo dei Priori municipal building in Perugia, Mancini presented the great ''Cattedrali'' in acrylic to the public.\nThis series culminated in 1984 with an exhibition at the Rocca Paolina in Perugia.<ref>C.V.

{"title_page": "Georgian Dublin", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\n[[Image:MaltonCH.jpg|thumb|240px|<center>18th century view of the [[Royal Exchange, Dublin|Royal Exchange]] one of \"Malton's views of Dublin\"</center>]]\n\n'''''Georgian Dublin''''' is a phrase used in terms of the [[history of Dublin]] that has two interwoven meanings:\n# to describe a historic period in the development of the city of [[Dublin]], Ireland, from 1714 (the beginning of the reign of King [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] of Great Britain and of Ireland) to the death in 1830 of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. During this period, the reign of the four Georges, hence the word ''Georgian'', covers a particular and unified style, derived from [[Palladian Architecture]], which was used in erecting public and private buildings\n# to describe the modern day surviving buildings in Dublin erected in that period and which share that architectural style\n\nThough, strictly speaking, [[Georgian architecture]] could only exist during the reigns of the four Georges, it had its antecedents prior to 1714 and its style of building continued to be erected after 1830, until replaced by later styles named after the then monarch, Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], i.e. ''Victorian''.\n\n==Dublin's development==\nDublin was for much of its existence a [[medieval]] city, marked by the existence of a particular style of buildings, built on narrow winding medieval streets. The first major changes to this pattern occurred during the reign of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] when the then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Earl of Ormonde]] (later made [[Duke of Ormonde]]) issued an instruction which was to have dramatic repercussions for the city as it exists today. Though the city over the century had grown around the [[River Liffey]], as in many other medieval cities, buildings backed onto the river. This allowed the dumping of household waste directly into the river, creating a form of collective sewer. As Dublin's quays underwent development, Ormonde insisted that the ''frontages'' of the houses, not their rears, should face the quay sides, with a street to run along each quay. By this single regulation Ormonde changed the face of the city. No longer would the river be a sewer hidden between buildings. Instead it became a central feature of the city, with its quays lined by large three and four-storey houses and classic public buildings, such as the [[Four Courts]], the old Custom House and, later and grander, [[The Custom House]] designed, as was the Four Courts, by master architect [[James Gandon]]. For his initiative, Ormonde's name is now given to one of the city quays. \n\nIt was, however, only one of a number of crucial developments. As the city grew in size, stature, population and wealth, two changes were needed. (1) The existing narrow street medieval city required major redevelopment, and (2) major new development of residential areas was required.\n\n==Rebuilding Dublin's Core==\n[[File:Electric chandeliers, georgian ceiling in Dublin, May 2003.jpg|thumb|An example of Georgian opulence.<br>A ceiling from the Dublin townhouse of [[Viscount Powerscourt]], showing the splendour of Georgian decoration. His former townhouse was sensitively turned into a shopping centre in the 1980s.]] A new body called the [[Wide Streets Commission]] was created to remodel the old medieval city. It created a network of main thoroughfares by wholesale demolition or widening of old streets or the creation of entirely new ones. On the north side of the city, a series of narrow streets were merged and widened enormously to create a new street, called ''Sackville Street'' (now called [[O'Connell Street]]). At its lower end, a new bridge (now called [[O'Connell Bridge]]) was erected, beyond which two new streets in the form of a 'V' appeared, known as [[Westmoreland Street]] and [[D'Olier Street]]. Westmoreland Street in turn led to a renamed ''Hoggen Green'', which became ''[[College Green, Dublin|College Green]]'' because it faced unto [[Trinity College Dublin]]. The new [[Irish Houses of Parliament]], designed by [[Edward Lovett Pearce]], also faced onto College Green, while from College Green a new widened [[Dame Street]] led directly down to the medieval [[Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin]], past [[Dublin Castle]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]], the latter a new building. The Castle began the process of rebuilding, turning it from a medieval castle to a Georgian palace.\n\n==18th Century Property Developers==\n[[File:Mountjoy Square, Dublin, Ireland (January 2010).jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Square]], Dublin, Ireland (January 2010)]] \nWhile the rebuilding by the Wide Streets Commission fundamentally changed the streetscape in Dublin, a property boom led to additional building outside the central core. Unlike twentieth century building booms in Dublin the eighteenth century developments were carefully controlled. The developing areas were divided into precincts, each of which was given to a different developer. The scope of their developments were restricted, however, with strict controls imposed on style of residential building, design of buildings and location, so producing a cohesive unity that came to be called Georgian Dublin. \n\n[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|left|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. The street contains some of the oldest and largest Georgian houses in Dublin. It was converted into tenements in the latter part of the 19th century.]]\nInitially developments were focused on the city's north side. Among the earliest developments was ''Henrietta Street'', a wide street lined on both sides by massive Georgian houses built on a palatial scale. At the top end of the street, a new [[James Gandon]] building, the ''[[King's Inns]]'', was erected between 1795 and 1816. In this building, [[barrister]]s were trained and earned their academic qualifications. Such was the prestige of the street that many of the most senior figures in Irish 'establishment' society, [[peers of the realm]], judges, barristers, bishops bought houses here. Under the [[anti-Catholic]] [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], [[Roman Catholic]]s, though the overwhelming majority in Ireland, were harshly discriminated against, barred from holding property rights or from voting in parliamentary elections until 1793. Thus the houses of Georgian Dublin, particularly in the early phase before [[Catholic Emancipation]] was granted in 1829, were almost invariably owned by a small [[Church of Ireland]] [[Anglican]] elite, with Catholics only gaining admittance to the houses as skivvies and servants. Ultimately the north side was laid out centred on two major squares, ''Rutland Square'' (now called ''[[Parnell Square]]'' for [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]), at the top end of Sackville Street, and ''[[Mountjoy Square]]''. Such was the prestige of the latter square that among its many prominent residents was the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]]. Many of the streets in the new areas were named after the property developers, often with developers commemorated both in their name and by their peerage when the received one. Among the streets named after developers are ''Capel Street'', ''Mountjoy Square'' and ''Aungier Street''. \n\n[[File:Dublin Castle Four Court.jpg|thumb|[[Dublin Castle]]'s Georgian Upper Castle Yard<br>The main body of the Castle was rebuilt along Georgian lines following a disastrous fire in the late seventeenth century]]\nFor the initial years of the Georgian era, the north side of the city was considered a far more respectable area to live. However, when the [[Earl of Kildare]] chose to move to a new large ducal palace built for him on what up to that point was seen as the ''inferior'' southside, he caused shock. When his Dublin townhouse, Kildare House (renamed [[Leinster House]] when he was made Duke of Leinster) was finished, it was by far the biggest aristocratic residence other than Dublin Castle, and it was greeted with envy. \n\nThe Earl had predicted that his move would be followed, and it was. Three new residential squares appeared on the southside, [[Merrion Square]] (facing his residence's garden front), [[St Stephen's Green]] and the smallest and last of Dublin's five Georgian squares to be built, [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. [[Aristocracy (class)|Aristocrats]], bishops and the wealthy sold their northside townhouses and migrated to the new southside developments, even though many of the developments, particularly in Fitzwilliam Square, were smaller and less impressive than the buildings in [[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. While the wealthier people lived in houses ''on'' the squares, those with lesser means and lesser titles lived in smaller, less grand but still impressive developments off the main squares, such as Upper and Lower Mount Street and [[Leeson Street]].\n\n==The Act of Union and Georgian Dublin==\n[[File:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|left|Leinster House<br>18th century ducal palace built by the Duke of Leinster. Since 1922 it has served as the seat of the modern Irish parliament, ''[[Oireachtas \u00c9ireann]]''.]]\n[[File:Djustice.jpg|thumb|upright|A surviving Georgian house on [[St. Stephen's Green]], stuck between a Victorian building (picture right) and a 1960s office block (left). Over half the Georgian buildings on St. Stephen's Green having been lost since the Georgian era, with many demolished in the 1950s and 1960s .]]\n\nAlthough the Irish Parliament was composed exclusively of representatives of the [[Anglo Irish Ascendency]], the established ruling minority Protestant community in Ireland, it did show significant sparks of independence, most notably the achievement of full legislative independence in 1782, where all the restrictions previously surrounding the powers of the new parliament in College Green, notably [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] were repealed. This period of legislative freedom however was short-lived. \n\nIn 1800, under pressure from the British Government of Mr. Pitt, in the wake of the rebellion of the last years of the century, which was aided and abetted by the French invasion in support of the rebels [[Dublin Castle]] administration of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] both the House of Commons and the House of Lords passed the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]], uniting both the Kingdom of Ireland and its parliament with the Kingdom of Great Britain and its parliament in London. As a result, from 1 January 1801 Dublin found itself without a parliament with which to draw hundreds of peers and bishops, along with their thousands of servants. While many did come to Dublin still for the ''Social Season'', where the Lord Lieutenant hosted debutantes balls, state balls and drawing rooms in a period from January until [[St. Patrick's Day]] (17 March) every year, many found them less appealing than in the days when they could sit in parliament for a session in College Green. Many of the leading peers, including the [[Duke of Leinster]] and [[Viscount Powerscourt]], almost immediately sold their palatial Dublin townhouses, Powerscourt House and Leinster House. Though many still flocked to Dublin every social season, many didn't or went to London. The loss of their revenue and that of their extensive staff hurt the Dublin economy severely. While the 'new' Georgian centres southside continued to flourish, the northside Georgian squares soon fell into squalor, as new owners of the buildings crammed in massive numbers of poor into the former residences of earls and bishops, in some cases cramming an entire family into one old drawing room. Mountjoy Square in particular became run-down, until such was its state and degree of dereliction in the 1980s that it was used as a film set for stories set in post-[[the Blitz|blitz]] London and post-[[World War II|war]] [[Berlin]]. The empty shells of the graceful houses, reduced to unsanitary tenements before being demolished in the 1980s, were used as a backdrop for a [[U2]] rock video.\n\n==Georgian Dublin today==\n[[File:Georgian doors in Fitzwilliam Square - geograph.org.uk - 228788.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Georgian doorways in Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. ]]\nIn the years after independence in 1922, [[Irish Free State|independent Ireland]] had little sympathy for Georgian Dublin, viewing it as a symbol of British rule and of the [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] identity that was alien to Irish identity. By this time, many of the gentry who had lived in them had moved elsewhere; some to the wealthy Victorian suburbs of [[Rathmines]] and [[Rathgar]], [[Killiney]] and [[Ballsbridge]], where Victorian residences were built on larger plots of land, allowing for gardens, rather than the lack of space of the Georgian eras. Those that had not moved in many cases had by the early twentieth century sold their mansions in Dublin. The abolition of the [[Dublin Castle]] administration and the Lord Lieutenant in 1922 saw an end to Dublin's traditional \"[[Irish Social Season|Social Season]]\" of masked balls, drawing rooms and court functions in the Castle. Many of the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] families lost their heirs in the [[First World War]], their homes in the country to [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] burnings (during the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]]) and their townhouses to the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]]. Daisy, the [[Countess of Fingall]], in her regularly republished memoirs ''Seventy Years Young'', wrote in the 1920s of the disappearance of that world and of her change from a big townhouse in Dublin, full of servants to a small flat with one maid. By the 1920s and certainly by the 1930s, many of the previous homes in Merrion Square had become business addresses of companies, with only Fitzwilliam Square of all the five squares having any residents. (Curiously, in the 1990s, new wealthy businessmen such as Sir [[Tony O'Reilly]] and [[Dermot Desmond]] began returning to live in former offices they had bought and converted ''back'' into homes.) By the 1930s, plans were discussed in [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government to demolish all of Merrion Square, perhaps the most intact of the five squares, on the basis that the houses were \"old fashioned\" and \"un-national\". These plans were put on hold in 1939 due to the outbreak of [[World War II]] and a lack of capital and investment and had been essentially forgotten about by 1945. \n\n[[File:Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Lower [[Leeson Street]], Dublin, Ireland. [[Mock-Georgian]] houses erected in the 1980s and 1990s, where the previous Georgian buildings had been demolished decades earlier. ]]\nSome destruction of Georgian buildings did still occur despite these circumstances. [[Mountjoy Square]], was under threat when a large amount of property on the south side was demolished by property speculators during the 1960s and 70s; even so, buildings with facsimile facades were subsequently built in place, re-completing the square's uniform external appearance. The world's longest row of Georgian houses, running from the corner of Merrion Square down to Leeson Street Bridge, was divided in the early 1960s to demolish part of the row and replace them with a modern styled office block.\n\n[[File:Fitzwilliam Square West - geograph.org.uk - 1410337.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]] West]]\nBy the 1990s, attitudes had changed dramatically. Stricter new planning guidelines sought to protect the remaining Georgian buildings. During this period, a number of old houses in poor repair, which had been refused planning permission, caught fire and burnt to the ground, paved the way for redevelopment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} However, in contrast with the lax development controls applied in Ireland for many decades, by the 1990s a changed mindset among politicians, planners and the leaders of [[Dublin City Council]] (formerly [[Dublin Corporation]]) desired to preserve as much as possible of the remaining Georgian buildings.\n\nPerhaps the biggest irony for some is that residence that marked the move of the aristocrats from the northside to the southside (where the wealthier Dubliners have remained to this day), and that in some ways embodied Georgian Dublin, [[Leinster House]], home of the [[Duke of Leinster]], ended up as the parliament of independent republican Ireland; but his family also produced the republican leader [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]]. The decision in the late 1950s to demolish a row of Georgian houses in Kildare Place and replace them with a brick wall was greeted with jubilation by a republican minister at the time, [[Kevin Boland]], who said they stood for everything he opposed. He described members of the fledgling [[Irish Georgian Society]], newly formed to seek to protect Georgian buildings, of being \"belted earls\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Newtown Pery, Limerick|Newtown Pery]], Georgian Limerick\n* [[Pat Liddy's Walking Tours of Dublin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, Diarmuid, ''[http://www.corkuniversitypress.com/Georgian-Dublin-p/9781782051473.htm Georgian Dublin; The Forces That Shaped The City]'' (Cork University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9781782051473}})\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite speech |last=Treacy |first=Noel |title=Address on the occasion of the Celebration of the Award to the Hon.

During this period, the reign of the four Georges, hence the word ''Georgian'', covers a particular and unified style, derived from [[Palladian Architecture]], which was used in erecting public and private buildings\n# to describe the modern day surviving buildings in Dublin erected in that period and which share that architectural style\n\nThough, strictly speaking, [[Georgian architecture]] could only exist during the reigns of the four Georges, it had its antecedents prior to 1714 and its style of building continued to be erected after 1830, until replaced by later styles named after the then monarch, Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], i.e. ''Victorian''.\n\n==Dublin's development==\nDublin was for much of its existence a [[medieval]] city, marked by the existence of a particular style of buildings, built on narrow winding medieval streets. The first major changes to this pattern occurred during the reign of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] when the then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], the [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Earl of Ormonde]] (later made [[Duke of Ormonde]]) issued an instruction which was to have dramatic repercussions for the city as it exists today. Though the city over the century had grown around the [[River Liffey]], as in many other medieval cities, buildings backed onto the river. This allowed the dumping of household waste directly into the river, creating a form of collective sewer. As Dublin's quays underwent development, Ormonde insisted that the ''frontages'' of the houses, not their rears, should face the quay sides, with a street to run along each quay. By this single regulation Ormonde changed the face of the city. No longer would the river be a sewer hidden between buildings. Instead it became a central feature of the city, with its quays lined by large three and four-storey houses and classic public buildings, such as the [[Four Courts]], the old Custom House and, later and grander, [[The Custom House]] designed, as was the Four Courts, by master architect [[James Gandon]]. For his initiative, Ormonde's name is now given to one of the city quays. \n\nIt was, however, only one of a number of crucial developments. As the city grew in size, stature, population and wealth, two changes were needed. (1) The existing narrow street medieval city required major redevelopment, and (2) major new development of residential areas was required.\n\n==Rebuilding Dublin's Core==\n[[File:Electric chandeliers, georgian ceiling in Dublin, May 2003.jpg|thumb|An example of Georgian opulence.<br>A ceiling from the Dublin townhouse of [[Viscount Powerscourt]], showing the splendour of Georgian decoration. His former townhouse was sensitively turned into a shopping centre in the 1980s.]] A new body called the [[Wide Streets Commission]] was created to remodel the old medieval city. It created a network of main thoroughfares by wholesale demolition or widening of old streets or the creation of entirely new ones. On the north side of the city, a series of narrow streets were merged and widened enormously to create a new street, called ''Sackville Street'' (now called [[O'Connell Street]]). At its lower end, a new bridge (now called [[O'Connell Bridge]]) was erected, beyond which two new streets in the form of a 'V' appeared, known as [[Westmoreland Street]] and [[D'Olier Street]]. Westmoreland Street in turn led to a renamed ''Hoggen Green'', which became ''[[College Green, Dublin|College Green]]'' because it faced unto [[Trinity College Dublin]]. The new [[Irish Houses of Parliament]], designed by [[Edward Lovett Pearce]], also faced onto College Green, while from College Green a new widened [[Dame Street]] led directly down to the medieval [[Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin]], past [[Dublin Castle]] and the [[City Hall, Dublin|Royal Exchange]], the latter a new building. The Castle began the process of rebuilding, turning it from a medieval castle to a Georgian palace.\n\n==18th Century Property Developers==\n[[File:Mountjoy Square, Dublin, Ireland (January 2010).jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Square]], Dublin, Ireland (January 2010)]] \nWhile the rebuilding by the Wide Streets Commission fundamentally changed the streetscape in Dublin, a property boom led to additional building outside the central core. Unlike twentieth century building booms in Dublin the eighteenth century developments were carefully controlled. The developing areas were divided into precincts, each of which was given to a different developer. The scope of their developments were restricted, however, with strict controls imposed on style of residential building, design of buildings and location, so producing a cohesive unity that came to be called Georgian Dublin. \n\n[[File:HENRIETTA STREET - DUBLIN (402556531).jpg|thumb|left|[[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. The street contains some of the oldest and largest Georgian houses in Dublin. It was converted into tenements in the latter part of the 19th century.]]\nInitially developments were focused on the city's north side. Among the earliest developments was ''Henrietta Street'', a wide street lined on both sides by massive Georgian houses built on a palatial scale. At the top end of the street, a new [[James Gandon]] building, the ''[[King's Inns]]'', was erected between 1795 and 1816. In this building, [[barrister]]s were trained and earned their academic qualifications. Such was the prestige of the street that many of the most senior figures in Irish 'establishment' society, [[peers of the realm]], judges, barristers, bishops bought houses here. Under the [[anti-Catholic]] [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], [[Roman Catholic]]s, though the overwhelming majority in Ireland, were harshly discriminated against, barred from holding property rights or from voting in parliamentary elections until 1793. Thus the houses of Georgian Dublin, particularly in the early phase before [[Catholic Emancipation]] was granted in 1829, were almost invariably owned by a small [[Church of Ireland]] [[Anglican]] elite, with Catholics only gaining admittance to the houses as skivvies and servants. Ultimately the north side was laid out centred on two major squares, ''Rutland Square'' (now called ''[[Parnell Square]]'' for [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]), at the top end of Sackville Street, and ''[[Mountjoy Square]]''. Such was the prestige of the latter square that among its many prominent residents was the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Archbishop of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Dublin]]. Many of the streets in the new areas were named after the property developers, often with developers commemorated both in their name and by their peerage when the received one. Among the streets named after developers are ''Capel Street'', ''Mountjoy Square'' and ''Aungier Street''. \n\n[[File:Dublin Castle Four Court.jpg|thumb|[[Dublin Castle]]'s Georgian Upper Castle Yard<br>The main body of the Castle was rebuilt along Georgian lines following a disastrous fire in the late seventeenth century]]\nFor the initial years of the Georgian era, the north side of the city was considered a far more respectable area to live. However, when the [[Earl of Kildare]] chose to move to a new large ducal palace built for him on what up to that point was seen as the ''inferior'' southside, he caused shock. When his Dublin townhouse, Kildare House (renamed [[Leinster House]] when he was made Duke of Leinster) was finished, it was by far the biggest aristocratic residence other than Dublin Castle, and it was greeted with envy. \n\nThe Earl had predicted that his move would be followed, and it was. Three new residential squares appeared on the southside, [[Merrion Square]] (facing his residence's garden front), [[St Stephen's Green]] and the smallest and last of Dublin's five Georgian squares to be built, [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. [[Aristocracy (class)|Aristocrats]], bishops and the wealthy sold their northside townhouses and migrated to the new southside developments, even though many of the developments, particularly in Fitzwilliam Square, were smaller and less impressive than the buildings in [[Henrietta Street, Dublin|Henrietta Street]]. While the wealthier people lived in houses ''on'' the squares, those with lesser means and lesser titles lived in smaller, less grand but still impressive developments off the main squares, such as Upper and Lower Mount Street and [[Leeson Street]].\n\n==The Act of Union and Georgian Dublin==\n[[File:Leinsterhouseirl.jpg|thumb|left|Leinster House<br>18th century ducal palace built by the Duke of Leinster. Since 1922 it has served as the seat of the modern Irish parliament, ''[[Oireachtas \u00c9ireann]]''.]]\n[[File:Djustice.jpg|thumb|upright|A surviving Georgian house on [[St. Stephen's Green]], stuck between a Victorian building (picture right) and a 1960s office block (left). Over half the Georgian buildings on St. Stephen's Green having been lost since the Georgian era, with many demolished in the 1950s and 1960s .]]\n\nAlthough the Irish Parliament was composed exclusively of representatives of the [[Anglo Irish Ascendency]], the established ruling minority Protestant community in Ireland, it did show significant sparks of independence, most notably the achievement of full legislative independence in 1782, where all the restrictions previously surrounding the powers of the new parliament in College Green, notably [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] were repealed. This period of legislative freedom however was short-lived. \n\nIn 1800, under pressure from the British Government of Mr. Pitt, in the wake of the rebellion of the last years of the century, which was aided and abetted by the French invasion in support of the rebels [[Dublin Castle]] administration of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] both the House of Commons and the House of Lords passed the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]], uniting both the Kingdom of Ireland and its parliament with the Kingdom of Great Britain and its parliament in London. As a result, from 1 January 1801 Dublin found itself without a parliament with which to draw hundreds of peers and bishops, along with their thousands of servants. While many did come to Dublin still for the ''Social Season'', where the Lord Lieutenant hosted debutantes balls, state balls and drawing rooms in a period from January until [[St. Patrick's Day]] (17 March) every year, many found them less appealing than in the days when they could sit in parliament for a session in College Green. Many of the leading peers, including the [[Duke of Leinster]] and [[Viscount Powerscourt]], almost immediately sold their palatial Dublin townhouses, Powerscourt House and Leinster House. Though many still flocked to Dublin every social season, many didn't or went to London. The loss of their revenue and that of their extensive staff hurt the Dublin economy severely. While the 'new' Georgian centres southside continued to flourish, the northside Georgian squares soon fell into squalor, as new owners of the buildings crammed in massive numbers of poor into the former residences of earls and bishops, in some cases cramming an entire family into one old drawing room. Mountjoy Square in particular became run-down, until such was its state and degree of dereliction in the 1980s that it was used as a film set for stories set in post-[[the Blitz|blitz]] London and post-[[World War II|war]] [[Berlin]]. The empty shells of the graceful houses, reduced to unsanitary tenements before being demolished in the 1980s, were used as a backdrop for a [[U2]] rock video.\n\n==Georgian Dublin today==\n[[File:Georgian doors in Fitzwilliam Square - geograph.org.uk - 228788.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Georgian doorways in Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]]. ]]\nIn the years after independence in 1922, [[Irish Free State|independent Ireland]] had little sympathy for Georgian Dublin, viewing it as a symbol of British rule and of the [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] identity that was alien to Irish identity. By this time, many of the gentry who had lived in them had moved elsewhere; some to the wealthy Victorian suburbs of [[Rathmines]] and [[Rathgar]], [[Killiney]] and [[Ballsbridge]], where Victorian residences were built on larger plots of land, allowing for gardens, rather than the lack of space of the Georgian eras. Those that had not moved in many cases had by the early twentieth century sold their mansions in Dublin. The abolition of the [[Dublin Castle]] administration and the Lord Lieutenant in 1922 saw an end to Dublin's traditional \"[[Irish Social Season|Social Season]]\" of masked balls, drawing rooms and court functions in the Castle. Many of the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] families lost their heirs in the [[First World War]], their homes in the country to [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] burnings (during the [[Anglo-Irish War|Irish War of Independence]]) and their townhouses to the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]]. Daisy, the [[Countess of Fingall]], in her regularly republished memoirs ''Seventy Years Young'', wrote in the 1920s of the disappearance of that world and of her change from a big townhouse in Dublin, full of servants to a small flat with one maid. By the 1920s and certainly by the 1930s, many of the previous homes in Merrion Square had become business addresses of companies, with only Fitzwilliam Square of all the five squares having any residents. (Curiously, in the 1990s, new wealthy businessmen such as Sir [[Tony O'Reilly]] and [[Dermot Desmond]] began returning to live in former offices they had bought and converted ''back'' into homes.) By the 1930s, plans were discussed in [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s government to demolish all of Merrion Square, perhaps the most intact of the five squares, on the basis that the houses were \"old fashioned\" and \"un-national\". These plans were put on hold in 1939 due to the outbreak of [[World War II]] and a lack of capital and investment and had been essentially forgotten about by 1945. \n\n[[File:Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Lower [[Leeson Street]], Dublin, Ireland. [[Mock-Georgian]] houses erected in the 1980s and 1990s, where the previous Georgian buildings had been demolished decades earlier. ]]\nSome destruction of Georgian buildings did still occur despite these circumstances. [[Mountjoy Square]], was under threat when a large amount of property on the south side was demolished by property speculators during the 1960s and 70s; even so, buildings with facsimile facades were subsequently built in place, re-completing the square's uniform external appearance. The world's longest row of Georgian houses, running from the corner of Merrion Square down to Leeson Street Bridge, was divided in the early 1960s to demolish part of the row and replace them with a modern styled office block.\n\n[[File:Fitzwilliam Square West - geograph.org.uk - 1410337.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dublin's [[Fitzwilliam Square]] West]]\nBy the 1990s, attitudes had changed dramatically. Stricter new planning guidelines sought to protect the remaining Georgian buildings. During this period, a number of old houses in poor repair, which had been refused planning permission, caught fire and burnt to the ground, paved the way for redevelopment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} However, in contrast with the lax development controls applied in Ireland for many decades, by the 1990s a changed mindset among politicians, planners and the leaders of [[Dublin City Council]] (formerly [[Dublin Corporation]]) desired to preserve as much as possible of the remaining Georgian buildings.\n\nPerhaps the biggest irony for some is that residence that marked the move of the aristocrats from the northside to the southside (where the wealthier Dubliners have remained to this day), and that in some ways embodied Georgian Dublin, [[Leinster House]], home of the [[Duke of Leinster]], ended up as the parliament of independent republican Ireland; but his family also produced the republican leader [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]]. The decision in the late 1950s to demolish a row of Georgian houses in Kildare Place and replace them with a brick wall was greeted with jubilation by a republican minister at the time, [[Kevin Boland]], who said they stood for everything he opposed. He described members of the fledgling [[Irish Georgian Society]], newly formed to seek to protect Georgian buildings, of being \"belted earls\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Newtown Pery, Limerick|Newtown Pery]], Georgian Limerick\n* [[Pat Liddy's Walking Tours of Dublin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, Diarmuid, ''[http://www.corkuniversitypress.com/Georgian-Dublin-p/9781782051473.htm Georgian Dublin; The Forces That Shaped The City]'' (Cork University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9781782051473}})\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite speech |last=Treacy |first=Noel |title=Address on the occasion of the Celebration of the Award to the Hon.

It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.
