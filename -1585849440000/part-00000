Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.

The scarcer an object or event is, the more value that thing holds. The abundance is the indicator of the value. is a     mental shortcut that places a value on an item based on how easily it might be lost, especially to competitors. The scarcity heuristic stems from the idea that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more value that item has.

Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used by our memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).\n\nThere are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways:\n\n# ''Right-angle bias'': when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. \n# ''Symmetry heuristic'': when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. \n# ''Rotation heuristic'': when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. \n# ''Alignment heuristic'': similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are.\n# ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.\n\nAnother method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310\u20131315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\"Heuristic device\" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K.

(2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}</ref>\n\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.\nIn truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.\n\nFor instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as [[software patent]]s \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | journal = Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269\u2013314 }}</ref>\n\n== Stereotyping ==\n\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title=\"On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping\", in Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=978-1572304215|pages=271\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions),<ref name=\":0\" /> to whether a plant is a tree based on the assumption that it is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\n\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&pg=PA135&dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=G\u00f6k\u00e7en|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial intelligence ==\nA [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space.

This leads people to avoid others that are viewed as \u201ccontaminated\u201d to the observer. This happens due     to the fact of the observer viewing something that is seen as bad or to seek objects that have been associate with what seems good. Somethings one can view as harmful can tend not to really be. This sometimes leads to irrational thinking on behalf of the observer. \n*[[Effort heuristic]] -  the worth of an object is determined by the amount of effort put into the production of the object. Objects that took longer to produce are more  valuable while the objects that took less time are deemed not as valuable. Also applies to how much effort is put into achieving the product. This can be seen as the difference of working and earning the object versus  finding the object on the side of the street. It can be the same object but the one found will not be deemed as valuable as the one that we earned. \n*[[Escalation of commitment]] \u2013 Describes the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

Usually not every event is seen as complete but what was felt at the     climax whether the event was pleasant or unpleasant to the observer.\u00a0 All other feelings is not lost but is not used. This can also include how long the event happened. \n*[[Representativeness heuristic]] \u2013 A mental shortcut used when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty.   Or, judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind. For example, in a 1982 Tversky and Kahneman experiment, participants were given a description of a woman named Linda.  Based on the description, it was likely that Linda was a feminist.  Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.  The likelihood of two events cannot be greater than that of either of the two events individually. For this reason, the representativeness heuristic is exemplary of the [[conjunction fallacy]].<ref name=\"Harvey, N. 2007\"/>\n*[[Scarcity heuristic]] - works as the same as the economy. The scarcer an object or event is, the more value that thing holds. The abundance is the indicator of the value. is a     mental shortcut that places a value on an item based on how easily it might be lost, especially to competitors. The scarcity heuristic stems from the idea that the more difficult it is to acquire an item the more value that item has. In many situations we use an item\u2019s availability, its perceived abundance, to quickly estimate quality and/or utility. This can lead to systemic errors or [[cognitive bias]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Michael|date=March 1992|title=The Psychology of Unavailability: Explaining Scarcity and Cost Effects on Value|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15324834basp1301_2|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3\u20137|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1301_2|issn=0197-3533}}</ref>\n*[[Simulation heuristic]] - simplified mental strategy in which people determine the likelihood of an event happening based on how easy it is to mentally picture the event happening. People regret the events that are easier to image over the ones that would be harder to. It is also thought that people will use this heuristic to predict the likelihood of another's behavior happening. This shows that people are constantly simulating everything around them in order to be able to predict the likelihood of events around them. It is believe that people do this by mentally undoing events that they have experienced and then running mental simulations of the events with the corresponding input values of the altered model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|date=1981-05-15|title=Variants of Uncertainty|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21236/ada099503|location=Fort Belvoir, VA}}</ref>\n*[[Social proof]]\n\n=== Formal models of heuristics ===\n\n*[[Fast-and-frugal trees]]\n*[[Fluency heuristic]]\n*[[Gaze heuristic]]\n*[[Recognition heuristic]]\n*[[Satisficing]]\n*[[Similarity heuristic]]\n*[[Take-the-best heuristic]]\n\n=== Cognitive maps ===\nHeuristics were also found to be used in the manipulation and creation of [[cognitive maps]]. Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used by our memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).\n\nThere are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways:\n\n# ''Right-angle bias'': when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. \n# ''Symmetry heuristic'': when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. \n# ''Rotation heuristic'': when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. \n# ''Alignment heuristic'': similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are.\n# ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.\n\nAnother method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310\u20131315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\"Heuristic device\" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the \"ideal city\" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one opted for certain principles and carried them through rigorously.\n\n\"Heuristic\" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.<ref>[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K.

Wimsatt]], and others.)\n\n== Law ==\nIn [[legal theory]], especially in the theory of [[law and economics]], heuristics are used in the [[law]] when [[case method|case-by-case analysis]] would be impractical, insofar as \"practicality\" is defined by the interests of a governing body.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer and Christoph Engel, eds. (2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}</ref>\n\nThe present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.\nIn truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.\n\nFor instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility. Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession. This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the patent application was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries \u2013 such as [[software patent]]s \u2013 should be protected for different lengths of time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | journal = Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269\u2013314 }}</ref>\n\n== Stereotyping ==\n\nStereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title=\"On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping\", in Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=978-1572304215|pages=271\u201392|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}</ref> They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person (based on their actions),<ref name=\":0\" /> to whether a plant is a tree based on the assumption that it is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves (even though the person making the evaluation might never have seen that particular type of tree before).\n\nStereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&pg=PA135&dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=G\u00f6k\u00e7en|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Artificial intelligence ==\nA [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space.

It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} ([[dioxygen]]). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nOzone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O<sub>3</sub> structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.<ref name=streng>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1021/je00103a031\n| volume = 6\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 431\u2013436\n| last1 = Streng\n| first1 = A.

This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2\u03bb<sup>4</sup>-trioxidiene''{{dubious|date=February 2019}} and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (\u1f44\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.\n\nIn appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In an even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.\n\n''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for the ozone given above.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sch\u00f6nbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein]] (18 October 1799 \u2013 29 August 1868)]]\n[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865.

While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen\n\n: <chem>O2 ->[\\ce{photon}][(\\ce{radiation}\\ \\lambda\\ <\\ 240\\ \\ce{nm})] 2O</chem>\nfollowed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.\n:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M \u2192 {{chem|O|3}} + M\n\nwhere \"M\" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction.

This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O<sub>2</sub>\n\n:{{chem|O|3}} + O \u2192 2 {{chem|O|2}}\n\nAn estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>3</sub>. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.\n\n{{See also|Ozone-oxygen cycle|Ozone depletion}}\n\n====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====\n[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation.

The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.\n\nThe ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315\u2013400&nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).\n\n===Low level ozone===\n{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}\n\nLow level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.<ref name=who-Europe>[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide].

The nonattainment standard indicates that an area does not meet the EPA's air quality standards. The Colorado Ozone Action Plan was created in response, and numerous changes were implemented from this plan. The first major change was that car emission testing was expanded across the state to more counties that did not previously mandate emissions testing, like areas of Larimer and Weld County. There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels.\n\nOne large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the OIl and Natural Gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado's metropolitan areas.

[[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.\n\n====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====\nAlthough ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.<ref>{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU \u2013 The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth.

Despite high levels in the lung tissues, however, their ability to clear bacteria appears impaired by exposure to ozone.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe adaptive immune system is the branch of immunity that provides long-term protection via the development of antibodies targeting specific pathogens and is also impacted by high ozone exposure.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/><ref name=\"Travers P 2001\"/> Lymphocytes, a cellular component of the adaptive immune response, produce an increased amount of inflammatory chemicals called \"cytokines\" after exposure to ozone, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity and worsening asthma symptoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe airway epithelial cells also play an important role in protecting individuals from pathogens. In normal tissue, the epithelial layer forms a protective barrier, and also contains specialized ciliary structures that work to clear foreign bodies, mucus and pathogens from the lungs. When exposed to ozone, the cilia become damaged and mucociliary clearance of pathogens is reduced. Furthermore, the epithelial barrier becomes weakened, allowing pathogens to cross the barrier, proliferate and spread into deeper tissues. Together, these changes in the epithelial barrier help make individuals more susceptible to pulmonary infections.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nInhaling ozone not only affects the immune system and lungs, but it may also affect the heart as well.

The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: <blockquote>\"Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations.\"<ref>[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety</ref></blockquote> To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 \u03bcmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 \u03bcmol/mol.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)</ref> Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL.

H. Johnston Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]\n\nOzone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O<sub>2</sub> will not react.<ref name=brown/> Ozone used in industry is measured in \u03bcmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.\n\nTemperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.\n\n===Corona discharge method===\n[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]\nThis is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the \"hot spark\" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]] or ozone plate.<ref>https://www.a2zozone.com/blogs/news/ozone-tube-vs-ozone-plate</ref><ref>{{OrgSynth|author=Smith, L.

Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. At room temperature, nitric acid will form into a vapour that is hazardous if inhaled. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches and a dry nose and throat causing a burning sensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Ozone Generator Reviews and Guide 2019 |url=https://www.freshairguide.com/best-ozone-generator/#ozgenfaq |website=www.freshairguide.com}}</ref> Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.\n\n===Ultraviolet light===\n{{See also|Photochemistry}}\nUV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315\u2013334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\nUV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive. However, UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pools and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.\n\n===Cold plasma===\nIn the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.\n\nCold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.\n\nThe discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.\n\nSome cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>5</sub>, O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>7</sub>, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gujral|display-authors=etal|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167\u2013173|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Electrolytic===\nElectrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>.\nIn most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20\u201330% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}</ref> or boron-doped diamond.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe ozone to oxygen ratio is improved by increasing current density at the anode, cooling the electrolyte around the anode close to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, using an acidic electrolyte (such as dilute sulfuric acid) instead of a basic solution, and by applying pulsed current instead of DC.<ref name=\"Hale1919\">{{cite book|author=Hale, Arthur J., B.Sc., F.I.C.|title=The Manufacture of Chemicals by Electrolysis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDNDAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2019|year=1919|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Co.|pages=15, 16}}</ref>\n\n===Special considerations===\nOzone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.\n\nThe dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.\n\nBecause of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water comes in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].\n\n[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.\n\n===Incidental production===\nOzone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} \u2192 2O].

[[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit.

Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.\n\nIt can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.\n\nIt is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port.

Where [[Electric power|electrical power]] is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals.

Furthermore, its report states that \"results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer's operating instructions\".<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers]. Epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-01.</ref>\n\nOzonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food, drinking water, and surfaces in the home. According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is \"amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry.\" Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 \u03bcmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''. This quantity is 20,000 times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]-recommended limits stated above.<ref name=\"food\">{{cite web|last=Montecalvo |first=Joseph |author2=Doug Williams |title=Application of Ozonation in Sanitizing Vegetable Process Washwaters |publisher=California Polytechnic State University |url=http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |accessdate=2008-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528140629/http://www.cwtozone.com/files/articles/Food_Produce/Article%20-%20Veg.%20Process%20washwater.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Long| first=Ron| year=2008| url=http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715132442/http://www.purityintl.com/Article%20POU.pdf| archivedate=2011-07-15| title=POU Ozone Food Sanitation: A Viable Option for Consumers & the Food Service Industry}} (the report also shows that tapwater removes 99.95% of pathogens from lettuce; samples were inoculated with pathogens before treatment)</ref>\nOzone can be used to remove [[pesticide]] residues from [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s.<ref>{{cite web| last=Tersano Inc|year=2007| url=http://www.tersano.com/sanitizing_system_food.shtml | title=lotus Sanitises Food without Chemicals| accessdate=2007-02-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211025555/http://www.tersano.com/sanitizing_system_food.shtml |archivedate = 2007-02-11}}</ref><ref name=\"fruit\">{{cite book |title=Improving the Safety of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables |last=Jongen |first=W |year=2005 |publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-1-85573-956-7}}</ref>\n\nOzone is used in homes and [[hot tub]]s to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]]. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf |title=Alternative Disinfectants and Oxidant Guidance Manual|date=April 1999|publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref>\n\nOzone is also widely used in the treatment of water in aquariums and fishponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate \"yellowing\" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fishes' gill structures. Natural saltwater (with life forms) provides enough \"instantaneous demand\" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ions to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen-fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen and fishes' gill structures will atrophy, making them dependent on oxygen-enriched water.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n\nSince the invention of [[Dielectric Barrier Discharge]] (DBD) plasma reactors, it has been employed for water treatment with ozone. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Siemens |first1= Werner |date=1857 |title= About the electrostatic induction and the delay of the current in bottle wires. |journal= Annals of Physics |volume= 178 |issue= 9 |pages= 66 |doi=10.1002/andp.18571780905}}</ref> However, with cheaper alternative disinfectants like Chlorine, such applications of DBD ozone water decontamination have been limited by high power consumption and bulky equipment. <ref> {{cite article |last1= US Environmental Protection Agency. |date=2009 |title= Drinking Water Treatability Database.}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Sorlini |first1= Sabrina | last2= Collivignarelli |first2= Carlo |date=2005 |title= Trihalomethane formation during chemical oxidation with chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ozone of ten Italian natural waters |journal= Desalination |volume=176 |issue=1-3|pages=103-111}} </ref> Despite this, with research revealing the negative impacts of common disinfectants like Chlorine with respect to toxic residuals and ineffectiveness in killing certain micro-organisms <ref> {{cite journal |last1= Gallard |first1= Herv\u00e9 | last2= Gunten |first2= Urs von |date=2002 |title= Chlorination of natural organic matter: kinetics of chlorination and of THM formation. |journal= Water research |volume=36 |issue=1|pages=65-74}}</ref>, DBD plasma-based ozone decontamination is of interest in current available technologies.

It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} ([[dioxygen]]). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nOzone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O<sub>3</sub> structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.<ref name=streng>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1021/je00103a031\n| volume = 6\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 431\u2013436\n| last1 = Streng\n| first1 = A.

This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2\u03bb<sup>4</sup>-trioxidiene''{{dubious|date=February 2019}} and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (\u1f44\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.\n\nIn appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In an even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.\n\n''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for the ozone given above.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sch\u00f6nbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein]] (18 October 1799 \u2013 29 August 1868)]]\n[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865.

While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen\n\n: <chem>O2 ->[\\ce{photon}][(\\ce{radiation}\\ \\lambda\\ <\\ 240\\ \\ce{nm})] 2O</chem>\nfollowed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.\n:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M \u2192 {{chem|O|3}} + M\n\nwhere \"M\" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction.

This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O<sub>2</sub>\n\n:{{chem|O|3}} + O \u2192 2 {{chem|O|2}}\n\nAn estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>3</sub>. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.\n\n{{See also|Ozone-oxygen cycle|Ozone depletion}}\n\n====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====\n[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation.

The shorter portion of this band and even more energetic UV causes the formation of the ozone layer, when single oxygen atoms produced by UV [[photolysis]] of dioxygen (below 240&nbsp;nm) react with more dioxygen.

The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.\n\nThe ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315\u2013400&nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).\n\n===Low level ozone===\n{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}\n\nLow level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.<ref name=who-Europe>[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide].

The nonattainment standard indicates that an area does not meet the EPA's air quality standards. The Colorado Ozone Action Plan was created in response, and numerous changes were implemented from this plan. The first major change was that car emission testing was expanded across the state to more counties that did not previously mandate emissions testing, like areas of Larimer and Weld County. There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels.\n\nOne large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the OIl and Natural Gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado's metropolitan areas.

This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a [[radiative forcing]] effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as [[carbon dioxide]]. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived [[greenhouse gas]], which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than [[carbon dioxide]]. This means that over a 20-year span, the [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] / ton tropospheric ozone.<ref>Life Cycle Assessment Methodology Sufficient to Support Public Declarations and Claims, Committee Draft Standard, Version 2.1.

Annex B, Section 4.</ref>\n\nBecause of its short-lived nature, tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects, but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales.

Despite high levels in the lung tissues, however, their ability to clear bacteria appears impaired by exposure to ozone.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe adaptive immune system is the branch of immunity that provides long-term protection via the development of antibodies targeting specific pathogens and is also impacted by high ozone exposure.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/><ref name=\"Travers P 2001\"/> Lymphocytes, a cellular component of the adaptive immune response, produce an increased amount of inflammatory chemicals called \"cytokines\" after exposure to ozone, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity and worsening asthma symptoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe airway epithelial cells also play an important role in protecting individuals from pathogens. In normal tissue, the epithelial layer forms a protective barrier, and also contains specialized ciliary structures that work to clear foreign bodies, mucus and pathogens from the lungs. When exposed to ozone, the cilia become damaged and mucociliary clearance of pathogens is reduced. Furthermore, the epithelial barrier becomes weakened, allowing pathogens to cross the barrier, proliferate and spread into deeper tissues. Together, these changes in the epithelial barrier help make individuals more susceptible to pulmonary infections.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nInhaling ozone not only affects the immune system and lungs, but it may also affect the heart as well.

The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that: <blockquote>\"Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations.\"<ref>[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety</ref></blockquote> To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 \u03bcmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 \u03bcmol/mol.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)</ref> Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL.

H. Johnston Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]\n\nOzone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O<sub>2</sub> will not react.<ref name=brown/> Ozone used in industry is measured in \u03bcmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.\n\nTemperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.\n\n===Corona discharge method===\n[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]\nThis is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the \"hot spark\" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]] or ozone plate.<ref>https://www.a2zozone.com/blogs/news/ozone-tube-vs-ozone-plate</ref><ref>{{OrgSynth|author=Smith, L.

Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. At room temperature, nitric acid will form into a vapour that is hazardous if inhaled. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches and a dry nose and throat causing a burning sensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Ozone Generator Reviews and Guide 2019 |url=https://www.freshairguide.com/best-ozone-generator/#ozgenfaq |website=www.freshairguide.com}}</ref> Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.\n\n===Ultraviolet light===\n{{See also|Photochemistry}}\nUV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315\u2013334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\nUV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive. However, UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pools and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.\n\n===Cold plasma===\nIn the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.\n\nCold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.\n\nThe discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.\n\nSome cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>5</sub>, O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>7</sub>, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gujral|display-authors=etal|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167\u2013173|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Electrolytic===\nElectrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>.\nIn most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20\u201330% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}</ref> or boron-doped diamond.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe ozone to oxygen ratio is improved by increasing current density at the anode, cooling the electrolyte around the anode close to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, using an acidic electrolyte (such as dilute sulfuric acid) instead of a basic solution, and by applying pulsed current instead of DC.<ref name=\"Hale1919\">{{cite book|author=Hale, Arthur J., B.Sc., F.I.C.|title=The Manufacture of Chemicals by Electrolysis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDNDAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2019|year=1919|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Co.|pages=15, 16}}</ref>\n\n===Special considerations===\nOzone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.\n\nThe dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.\n\nBecause of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water comes in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].\n\n[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.\n\n===Incidental production===\nOzone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} \u2192 2O].

[[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit.

Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.\n\nIt can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.\n\nIt is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port.

This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is \"evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals\" or \"viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants\". Furthermore, its report states that \"results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer's operating instructions\".<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers].

According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is \"amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry.\" Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 \u03bcmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''.

Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]].

Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate \"yellowing\" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fishes' gill structures. Natural saltwater (with life forms) provides enough \"instantaneous demand\" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ions to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen-fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen and fishes' gill structures will atrophy, making them dependent on oxygen-enriched water.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n\nSince the invention of [[Dielectric Barrier Discharge]] (DBD) plasma reactors, it has been employed for water treatment with ozone. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Siemens |first1= Werner |date=1857 |title= About the electrostatic induction and the delay of the current in bottle wires. |journal= Annals of Physics |volume= 178 |issue= 9 |pages= 66 |doi=10.1002/andp.18571780905}}</ref> However, with cheaper alternative disinfectants like Chlorine, such applications of DBD ozone water decontamination have been limited by high power consumption and bulky equipment. <ref> {{cite article |last1= US Environmental Protection Agency. |date=2009 |title= Drinking Water Treatability Database.}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Sorlini |first1= Sabrina | last2= Collivignarelli |first2= Carlo |date=2005 |title= Trihalomethane formation during chemical oxidation with chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ozone of ten Italian natural waters |journal= Desalination |volume=176 |issue=1-3|pages=103-111}} </ref> Despite this, with research revealing the negative impacts of common disinfectants like Chlorine with respect to toxic residuals and ineffectiveness in killing certain micro-organisms <ref> {{cite journal |last1= Gallard |first1= Herv\u00e9 | last2= Gunten |first2= Urs von |date=2002 |title= Chlorination of natural organic matter: kinetics of chlorination and of THM formation. |journal= Water research |volume=36 |issue=1|pages=65-74}}</ref>, DBD plasma-based ozone decontamination is of interest in current available technologies.

The primary mechanisms used in this regard are extradition, lawful removal, and mutual legal assistance.<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/>\n\nExtradition is the mechanism by which one sovereign requests and obtains custody of a fugitive located within the jurisdiction and control of another sovereign.  It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the thirteenth century BCE, when an Egyptian Pharaoh negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite King.  Through the extradition process, a sovereign (the requesting state) typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (the requested state).  If the fugitive is found within the territory of the requested state, then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process. The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state.<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/>\n\nAside from mechanisms for the return of fugitives, states have also developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of legal assistance, such as witness statements or the service of documents, are needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate informally through their respective police agencies or, alternatively, resort to what is typically referred to as requests for \"mutual legal assistance\"<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/> The practice of mutual legal assistance developed from the comity-based system of letters rogatory, though it is now far more common for states to make mutual legal assistance requests directly to the designated \"Central Authorities\" within each state.  In contemporary practice, such requests may still be made on the basis of reciprocity but may also be made pursuant to bilateral and multilateral treaties that obligate countries to provide assistance.  Many countries are able to provide a broad range of mutual legal assistance to other countries even in the absence of a treaty.<ref name=\"Stigall2013\"/>\n\nThe financial crime expert Veit Buetterlin explained that transnational crime types such as counterfeiting, smuggling, human trafficking, drug trafficking, illegal logging, illegal mining, or illegal wildlife trade can only be effective if the involved crime networks can launder the proceeds.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/living-markets/videos/fighting-war-against-terrorist-financing |title = Fighting the war against terrorist financing}}</ref> He also mentioned that the international community needs to overcome a state where \u201ccriminals act internationally, while prosecutors stop at borders.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.moneylaunderingbulletin.com/legalandregulatory/practicefindings/defence-review---germany-video-134627.htm?origin=internalSearch |title = Defence review - Germany &#91;Video&#93; - Money Laundering Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n==Torture==\n{{see also|Torture}}\n{{quote|There can be few issues on which international legal opinion is more clear than on the condemnation of torture.

The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depend upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. However, a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection. Clinicians, therefore, classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as ''primary pathogens'' or as ''[[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]]'':\n; Primary pathogens\n: Primary pathogens cause disease as a result of their presence or activity within the normal, healthy host, and their intrinsic [[virulence]] (the severity of the disease they cause) is, in part, a necessary consequence of their need to reproduce and spread. Many of the most common primary pathogens of humans only infect humans, however, many serious diseases are caused by organisms acquired from the environment or that infect non-human hosts.\n; Opportunistic pathogens\n: Opportunistic pathogens can cause an infectious disease in a host with depressed resistance ([[immunodeficiency]]) or if they have unusual access to the inside of the body (for example, via [[Major trauma|trauma]]). [[Opportunistic infection]] may be caused by microbes ordinarily in contact with the host, such as [[pathogenic bacteria]] or fungi in the [[gastrointestinal]] or the [[upper respiratory tract]], and they may also result from (otherwise innocuous) microbes acquired from other hosts (as in ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' [[colitis]]) or from the environment as a result of [[Physical trauma|traumatic]] introduction (as in [[surgical]] wound infections or [[compound fracture]]s). An opportunistic disease requires impairment of host defenses, which may occur as a result of [[genetic defect]]s (such as [[Chronic granulomatous disease]]), exposure to [[antimicrobial]] drugs or [[immunosuppressive]] chemicals (as might occur following [[poison]]ing or [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy]]), exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity (such as with [[measles]], [[malaria]] or [[HIV disease]]). Primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host.<ref name=Sherris/>\n;{{anchor|Secondary infection}}Primary infection versus secondary infection\n: A primary infection is infection that is, or can practically be viewed as, the [[root cause]] of the current health problem. In contrast, a secondary infection is a [[sequela]] or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] of a root cause. For example, [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] is often a primary infection, but an infection that happened only because a [[burn]] or [[penetrating trauma]] (the root cause) allowed unusual access to deep tissues is a secondary infection. Primary pathogens often cause primary infection and also often cause secondary infection. Usually opportunistic infections are viewed as secondary infections (because immunodeficiency or [[injury]] was the predisposing factor).\n\n==== Other types of infection ====\nOther types of infection consist of mixed, iatrogenic, nosocomial, and community-acquired infection. A mixed infection is an infection that is cause by two or more pathogens. An example of this is Appendicitis, which is caused by Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. The second is an iatrogenic infection. This type of infection is one that is transmitted from a health care worker to a patient. A nosocomial infection is also one that occurs in a health care setting. Nosocomial infections are those that are acquired during a hospital stay. Lastly a community-acquired infection is one in which the infection is acquired from a whole community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Infectious or not===\nOne manner of proving that a given disease is infectious, is to satisfy [[Koch's postulates]] (first proposed by [[Robert Koch]]), which require that first, the [[infectious agent]] be identifiable only in patients who have the disease, and not in healthy controls, and second, that patients who contract the infectious agent also develop the disease. These postulates were first used in the discovery that [[Mycobacteria]] species cause [[tuberculosis]].\n\nHowever, Koch's postulates cannot usually be tested in modern practice for ethical reasons. Proving them would require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a [[pathogen]] produced as a pure culture. Conversely, even clearly infectious diseases do not always meet the infectious criteria; for example, ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', the causative [[spirochete]] of [[syphilis]], cannot be [[microbiological culture|cultured]] ''in vitro'' \u2013 however the organism can be cultured in rabbit [[testes]]. It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture.\n\n[[Epidemiology]], or the study and analysis of in who, why and where disease occurs, and what determines whether various populations have a disease, is another important tool used to understand infectious disease. Epidemiologists may determine differences among groups within a population, such as whether certain age groups have a greater or lesser rate of infection; whether groups living in different neighborhoods are more likely to be infected; and by other factors, such as gender and race. Researchers also may assess whether a disease [[outbreak]] is sporadic, or just an occasional occurrence; [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], with a steady level of regular cases occurring in a region; [[epidemic]], with a fast arising, and unusually high number of cases in a region; or [[pandemic]], which is a global epidemic. If the cause of the infectious disease is unknown, epidemiology can be used to assist with tracking down the sources of infection.\n\n===Contagiousness===\nInfectious diseases are sometimes called contagious diseases when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions (e.g., [[influenza]]). Thus, a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted. Other types of infectious, transmissible, or communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection, such as vector transmission or sexual transmission, are usually not regarded as \"contagious\", and often do not require medical isolation (sometimes loosely called [[quarantine]]) of victims. However, this specialized connotation of the word \"contagious\" and \"contagious disease\" (easy transmissibility) is not always respected in popular use.\nInfectious diseases are commonly transmitted from person to person through direct contact. The types of contact are through person to person and droplet spread. Indirect contact such as airborne transmission, contaminated objects, food and drinking water, animal person contact, animal reservoirs, insect bites, and environmental reservoirs  are another way infectious diseases are transmitted.<ref>(Higurea & Pietrangelo 2016)</ref>\n\n===By anatomic location===\nInfections can be classified by the anatomic location or [[organ system]] infected, including:\n* [[Urinary tract infection]]\n* [[Skin infection]]\n* [[Respiratory tract infection]]\n* [[Odontogenic infection]] (an infection that originates within a [[tooth]] or in the closely surrounding tissues)\n* [[Vaginal infections]]\n* [[Intra-amniotic infection]]\nIn addition, locations of [[inflammation]] where infection is the most common cause include [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and [[salpingitis]].\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe symptoms of an infection depend on the type of disease. Some signs of infection affect the whole body generally, such as [[fatigue]], loss of appetite, weight loss, [[fever]]s, night sweats, chills, aches and pains. Others are specific to individual body parts, such as skin [[rash]]es, [[cough]]ing, or a [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]].\n\nIn certain cases, infectious diseases may be [[asymptomatic]] for much or even all of their course in a given host. In the latter case, the disease may only be defined as a \"disease\" (which by definition means an illness) in hosts who secondarily become ill after contact with an asymptomatic carrier. An infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease, as some infections do not cause illness in a host.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\n===Bacterial or viral===\nAs bacterial and viral infections can both cause the same kinds of symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish which is the cause of a specific infection.<ref name=nipa>[http://www.antibiotics-info.org/bact02.asp \"Bacterial vs. Viral Infections \u2013 Do You Know the Difference?\"] National Information Program on Antibiotics</ref> Distinguishing the two is important, since viral infections cannot be cured by [[antibiotic]]s whereas bacterial infections can.<ref>{{cite book| title =The Truth About Illness and Disease|author1=Robert N.

Characteristic\n! [[Viral disease|Viral infection]]\n! [[Pathogenic bacteria|Bacterial infection]]\n|-\n|| Typical symptoms\n| In general, viral infections are systemic. This means they involve many different parts of the body or more than one body system at the same time; i.e. a runny nose, sinus congestion, cough, body aches etc. They can be local at times as in viral [[conjunctivitis]] or \"pink eye\" and herpes. Only a few viral infections are painful, like herpes. The pain of viral infections is often described as itchy or burning.<ref name=\"nipa\"/>\n| The classic symptoms of a bacterial infection are localized redness, heat, swelling and pain. One of the hallmarks of a bacterial infection is local pain, pain that is in a specific part of the body.

This is referred to as colonization. Most humans are not easily infected. Those with compromised or weakened immune systems have an increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections. Individuals who have a suppressed [[immune system]] are particularly susceptible to [[opportunistic infection]]s. Entrance to the host at [[host-pathogen interface]], generally occurs through the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] in orifices like the [[oral cavity]], nose, eyes, genitalia, anus, or the microbe can enter through open wounds. While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry, many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs. Some pathogens grow within the host cells (intracellular) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids.\n\n[[Wound]] colonization refers to non-replicating microorganisms within the wound, while in infected wounds, replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Negut|first=Irina|last2=Grumezescu|first2=Valentina|last3=Grumezescu|first3=Alexandru Mihai|date=2018-09-18|title=Treatment Strategies for Infected Wounds|journal=Molecules : A Journal of Synthetic Chemistry and Natural Product Chemistry|volume=23|issue=9|doi=10.3390/molecules23092392|issn=1420-3049|pmc=6225154|pmid=30231567|page=2392}}</ref>. All [[multicellular organism]]s are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms, and the vast majority of these exist in either a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[commensal]] relationship with the host. An example of the former is the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] species, which colonizes the [[mammal]]ian [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], and an example of the latter are the various species of [[staphylococcus]] that exist on [[human skin]]. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance. Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most [[virulent]] organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection. Some colonizing bacteria, such as ''[[Corynebacteria]] sp.'' and ''[[viridans streptococci]]'', prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and speeding [[wound healing]].\n[[File:Pathogenic Infection.png|thumb|<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duerkop|first=Breck A|last2=Hooper|first2=Lora V|date=2013-07-01|title=Resident viruses and their interactions with the immune system|journal=Nature Immunology|language=en|volume=14|issue=7|pages=654\u201359|doi=10.1038/ni.2614|pmc=3760236|pmid=23778792}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studyblue.com/notes/note/n/bacterial-pathogenesis/deck/11094651|title=Bacterial Pathogenesis at Washington University |location= St. Louis|website=StudyBlue|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2014/6/the-dangers-of-using-antibiotics-to-prevent-urinary-tract-infections/page-01?p=1|title=Print Friendly|website=www.lifeextension.com|access-date=2016-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202235200/http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2014/6/the-dangers-of-using-antibiotics-to-prevent-urinary-tract-infections/page-01?p=1|archive-date=2016-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> This image depicts the steps of pathogenic infection.]]\nThe variables involved in the outcome of a host becoming inoculated by a pathogen and the ultimate outcome include:\n* the route of entry of the [[pathogen]] and the access to host regions that it gains\n* the intrinsic [[virulence]] of the particular organism\n* the quantity or load of the initial inoculant\n* the [[immune system|immune]] status of the host being colonized\n\nAs an example, several [[staphylococcus|staphylococcal]] species remain harmless on the skin, but, when present in a normally [[sterile technique|sterile]] space, such as in the capsule of a [[joint]] or the [[peritoneum]], multiply without resistance and cause harm.\n\nAn interesting fact that [[gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry]], [[16S ribosomal RNA]] analysis, [[omics]], and other advanced technologies have made more apparent to humans in recent decades is that microbial colonization is very common even in environments that humans think of as being nearly [[asepsis|sterile]]. Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization, it is difficult to know which chronic wounds can be classified as infected and how much risk of progression exists. Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice, there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs. A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association's \"Rational Clinical Examination Series\" quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reddy M, Gill SS, Wu W | date = Feb 2012 | title = Does this patient have an infection of a chronic wound? | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 307 | issue = 6| pages = 605\u201311 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.98 | pmid = 22318282 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [likelihood ratio (LR) range, 11\u201320] makes infection much more likely, but the absence of pain (negative likelihood ratio range, 0.64\u20130.88) does not rule out infection (summary LR 0.64\u20130.88).\n\n===Disease===\n[[Disease]] can arise if the host's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host. [[Microorganism]]s can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes. For example, ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles, and [[staphylococcus]] releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis. Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts. For example, less than 5% of individuals infected with [[polio]] develop disease.<ref>http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4215.pdf</ref> On the other hand, some infectious agents are highly virulent. The [[prion]] causing [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] invariably kills all animals and people that are infected.\n\nPersistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection. Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism, often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection. There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body. Some viruses once acquired never leave the body. A typical example is the herpes virus, which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise.\n\nPersistent infections cause millions of deaths globally each year.<ref>[http://www.persistentinfection.net/ Chronic Infection Information] Retrieved on 2010-01-14 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722065612/http://www.persistentinfection.net/ |date=July 22, 2015 }}</ref> Chronic infections by parasites account for a high morbidity and mortality in many underdeveloped countries.\n\n===Transmission<!--linked from 'Transmission (medicine)'-->===\n{{Main|Transmission (medicine)}}\n[[File:CulexNil.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A southern house mosquito (''[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]'') is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] that transmits the pathogens that cause [[West Nile fever]] and [[avian malaria]] among others.]]For infecting organisms to survive and repeat the infection cycle in other hosts, they (or their progeny) must leave an existing reservoir and cause infection elsewhere. Infection transmission can take place via many potential routes:\n* '''Droplet contact''', also known as the ''respiratory route'', and the resultant infection can be termed [[airborne disease]]. If an infected person coughs or sneezes on another person the microorganisms, suspended in warm, moist droplets, may enter the body through the nose, mouth or eye surfaces.\n* '''Fecal-oral transmission''', wherein foodstuffs or water become contaminated (by people not washing their hands before preparing food, or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply) and the people who eat and drink them become infected.

''MetaPathogen.com''.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between ''[[optimal virulence|virulence versus transmissibility]]'' is complex; if a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}\nDiagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly. In practice most minor infectious diseases such as [[wart]]s, [[cutaneous]] [[abscesses]], [[respiratory system]] infections and [[diarrheal diseases]] are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent. Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent, the presence of a microbe in a community, and other epidemiological considerations. Given sufficient effort, all known infectious agents can be specifically identified. The benefits of identification, however, are often greatly outweighed by the cost, as often there is no specific treatment, the cause is obvious, or the outcome of an infection is [[benign]].\n\nDiagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by [[medical history]] and physical examination. More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient. Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features, by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens, and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype. Other techniques (such as [[X-ray]]s, [[CAT scans]], [[PET scan]]s or [[NMR]]) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent. The images are useful in detection of, for example, a bone [[abscess]] or a [[spongiform encephalopathy]] produced by a [[prion]].\n\n===Symptomatic diagnostics===\nThe diagnosis is aided by the presenting symptoms in any individual with an infectious disease, yet it usually needs additional diagnostic techniques to confirm the suspicion. Some signs are specifically characteristic and indicative of a disease and are called [[pathognomonic]] signs; but these are rare. Not all infections are symptomatic.<ref name=Sternak>{{cite journal|last1=Ljubin-Sternak|first1=Suncanica|last2=Mestrovic|first2=Tomislav|title=Review: Clamydia trachonmatis and Genital Mycoplasmias: Pathogens with an Impact on Human Reproductive Health|journal=Journal of Pathogens|page=3 |date=2014|volume=2014|issue=183167|doi=10.1155/2014/183167|pmid=25614838|pmc=4295611}}</ref>\n\nIn children the presence of [[cyanosis]], rapid breathing, poor peripheral perfusion, or a [[petechial rash]] increases the risk of a serious infection by greater than 5 fold.<ref name=Lancet10>{{cite journal |vauthors=Van den Bruel A, Haj-Hassan T, Thompson M, Buntinx F, Mant D | title = Diagnostic value of clinical features at presentation to identify serious infection in children in developed countries: a systematic review | journal = Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9717 | pages = 834\u201345 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20132979 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)62000-6 | url =  }}</ref> Other important indicators include parental concern, clinical instinct, and temperature greater than 40&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Lancet10/>\n\n===Microbial culture===\n[[File:K pneumoniae M morganii providencia styphimuriuma.JPG|thumb|200px|Four [[nutrient agar]] plates growing colonies of common [[Gram negative]] bacteria.]]\n[[Microbiological culture]] is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a [[growth medium]] is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient [[Agar#Microbiology|agar]], a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a [[bacterium]], along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a [[Colony (biology)|colony]], which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its [[Strain (biology)|strain]]), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of [[virus]]es: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a \"plaque\". [[Eukaryotic]] [[parasites]] may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent.\n\nIn the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals. Bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' and ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in [[embryo]]nated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. [[Chagas disease]] is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of the Chagas agent ''T. cruzi'', an uninfected [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of ''T. cruzi'' within its gut.\n\n===Microscopy===\nAnother principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is [[microscopy]]. Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely, at some point, on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent. Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments, such as the compound [[light microscope]], or with instruments as complex as an [[electron microscope]]. Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope, and can often rapidly lead to identification. Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with [[biochemical]] [[staining]] techniques, and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with [[antibody]] based techniques. For example, the use of [[Antibody|antibodies]] made artificially [[fluorescent]] (fluorescently labeled antibodies) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific [[antigen]]s present on a pathogen. A [[fluorescence microscope]] is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells. This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases, where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly.\n\nOther microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents. Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic [[dye]]s due to the [[electrostatic]] attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye. A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background. Staining a cell with a dye such as [[Giemsa]] stain or [[crystal violet]] allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells. The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the [[taxonomic classification]] of microbes as well. Two methods, the [[Gram stain]] and the [[acid-fast]] stain, are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease. The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]], both of which contain many significant human pathogens. The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' and ''[[Nocardia]]''.\n\n===Biochemical tests===\nBiochemical tests used in the identification of infectious agents include the detection of [[metabolic]] or [[enzymatic]] products characteristic of a particular infectious agent. Since bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s in patterns characteristic of their [[genus]] and [[species]], the detection of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products is commonly used in bacterial identification. [[Acids]], [[alcohols]] and [[gases]] are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in [[Growth medium#Selective media|selective]] liquid or solid media.\n\nThe isolation of [[enzymes]] from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease. For example, humans can make neither [[RNA replicase]]s nor [[reverse transcriptase]], and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic., of specific types of viral infections. The ability of the viral protein [[hemagglutinin]] to bind [[red blood cells]] together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection, although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an ''enzyme'' and has no metabolic function.\n\n[[Serological]] methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms. These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen. The antigen, usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent, is bound by the antibody. This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways, dependent upon the test. For example, \"[[Strep throat]]\" is often diagnosed within minutes, and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent, ''[[S. pyogenes]]'', that is retrieved from a patient's throat with a cotton swab. Serological tests, if available, are usually the preferred route of identification, however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require [[refrigeration]]. Some serological methods are extremely costly, although when commonly used, such as with the \"strep test\", they can be inexpensive.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\nComplex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as [[Immunoassays]]. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody \u2013 antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro-magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\n\nInstrumentation can be used to read extremely small signals created by secondary reactions linked to the antibody \u2013 antigen binding. Instrumentation can control sampling, reagent use, reaction times, signal detection, calculation of results, and data management to yield a cost-effective automated process for diagnosis of infectious disease.\n\n===PCR-based diagnostics===\nTechnologies based upon the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future, for several reasons. First, the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified. Second, an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease. This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR. Third, the essential tools for directing PCR, [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], are derived from the [[genomes]] of infectious agents, and with time those genomes will be known, if they are not already.\n\nThus, the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available. The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application, neither of which is insurmountable. The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods, such as some of the [[clostridia]]l diseases ([[tetanus]] and [[botulism]]). These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent [[neurotoxin]]s. A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur, this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria.\n\n===Metagenomic sequencing===\nGiven the wide range of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that cause debilitating and life-threatening illness, the ability to quickly identify the cause of infection is important yet often challenging. For example, more than half of cases of [[encephalitis]], a severe illness affecting the brain, remain undiagnosed, despite extensive testing using state-of-the-art clinical laboratory methods. [[Metagenomics]] is currently being researched for clinical use, and shows promise as a sensitive and rapid way to diagnose infection using a single all-encompassing test. This test is similar to current PCR tests; however, amplification of genetic material is unbiased rather than using [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for a specific infectious agent. This amplification step is followed by next-generation sequencing and [[Sequence alignment|alignment comparisons]] using large databases of thousands of organismic and viral genomes.\n\nMetagenomic sequencing could prove especially useful for diagnosis when the patient is [[immunocompromised]]. An ever-wider array of infectious agents can cause serious harm to individuals with immunosuppression, so clinical screening must often be broader. Additionally, the expression of symptoms is often atypical, making clinical diagnosis based on presentation more difficult. Thirdly, diagnostic methods that rely on the detection of antibodies are more likely to fail. A broad, sensitive test for pathogens that detects the presence of infectious material rather than antibodies is therefore highly desirable.\n\n===Indication of tests===\nThere is usually an [[indication (medicine)|indication]] for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease, or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures. For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of [[Zidovudine|AZT]] for the treatment of [[AIDS]], the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of [[HIV]] in specific communities permitted the advancement of [[hypotheses]] as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific [[serological]] diagnostic identification, and later [[genotypic]] or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the [[Time|temporal]] and [[geographic]]al origins of the virus, as well as a myriad of other hypothesis.<ref name=Sherris/> The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with [[anti-retroviral drugs]]. Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection. Thus, while there still is no cure for AIDS, there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals, both for the patient and for the community at large.\n\n==Prevention==\n{{main|Public health|Infection control}}\n[[File:OCD handwash.jpg|thumb|right|Washing one's hands, a form of [[hygiene]], is an effective way to prevent the spread of infectious disease.<ref name=handhygiene>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bloomfield SF, Aiello AE, Cookson B, O'Boyle C, Larson EL|url=http://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(07)00595-0/fulltext|title=The effectiveness of hand hygiene procedures including hand-washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the risks of infections in home and community settings|journal=American Journal of Infection Control|year=2007|volume=35|issue=10|pages=S27\u2013S64|doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2007.07.001}}</ref>]]\nTechniques like hand washing, wearing gowns, and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another.

Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important.\n\n[[Antimicrobials|Antimicrobial substances]] used to prevent transmission of infections include:\n* [[antiseptics]], which are applied to living [[biological tissue|tissue]]/[[skin]]\n* [[disinfectant]]s, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.\n* [[antibiotic]]s, called [[prophylactic]] when given as prevention rather as treatment of infection. However, long term use of antibiotics leads to resistance of bacteria. While humans do not become immune to antibiotics, the bacteria does. Thus, avoiding using antibiotics longer than necessary helps preventing bacteria from forming mutations that aide in antibiotic resistance.\n\nOne of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases.<ref name=Watts>{{cite book |author=Watts, Duncan |title=Six degrees: the science of a connected age |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-04142-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sixdegrees00dunc }}</ref> Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include [[virulence]], distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of [[Ebola]] virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone.<ref>{{cite book |author=Preston, Richard |title=The hot zone |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y. |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=978-0-385-49522-6 }}</ref> Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of [[Ebola]] is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] ([[HIV]]) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book |veditors=Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}</ref> As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an [[epidemic]].\n\nAnother effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of [[small-world networks]].<ref name=Watts/> In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. <sup>[6]</sup>{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}} Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the [[foot-and-mouth]] virus in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferguson NM, Donnelly CA, Anderson RM | title = The foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain: pattern of spread and impact of interventions | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5519 | pages = 1155\u201360 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11303090 | doi = 10.1126/science.1061020 | bibcode = 2001Sci...292.1155F | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d996865b2e6ac1ee4d5931ce0ca6d43d84879c9b }}</ref>\n\nA general method to prevent transmission of [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne pathogens is [[pest control]].\n\nIn cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, to control an epidemic.\n\n===Immunity===\n[[File:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Mallon]] (a.k.a.

Over the course of her career as a cook, she infected 53 people, three of whom died.]]\nInfection with most pathogens does not result in death of the host and the offending organism is ultimately cleared after the symptoms of the disease have waned.<ref name= Baron/> This process requires [[immune system|immune mechanisms]] to kill or inactivate the [[Inoculation|inoculum]] of the pathogen. Specific acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against infectious diseases may be mediated by [[Antibody|antibodies]] and/or [[T lymphocyte]]s. Immunity mediated by these two factors may be manifested by:\n* a direct effect upon a pathogen, such as antibody-initiated [[complement system|complement]]-dependent bacteriolysis, [[Opsonin|opsonoization]], [[phagocytosis]] and killing, as occurs for some bacteria,\n* neutralization of viruses so that these organisms cannot enter cells,\n* or by T lymphocytes, which will kill a cell parasitized by a microorganism.\n\nThe immune system response to a microorganism often causes symptoms such as a high [[fever]] and [[inflammation]], and has the potential to be more devastating than direct damage caused by a microbe.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\nResistance to infection ([[immunity (medical)|immunity]]) may be acquired following a disease, by [[asymptomatic carrier|asymptomatic carriage]] of the pathogen, by harboring an organism with a similar structure (crossreacting), or by [[vaccination]]. Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for [[opportunistic pathogen]]s.\nThere is also the phenomenon of [[herd immunity]] which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections.\n\nImmune resistance to an infectious disease requires a critical level of either antigen-specific antibodies and/or T cells when the host encounters the pathogen. Some individuals develop natural [[blood plasma|serum]] antibodies to the surface [[polysaccharide]]s of some agents although they have had little or no contact with the agent, these natural antibodies confer specific protection to adults and are [[passive immunization|passively transmitted]] to newborns.\n\n====Host genetic factors====\nThe organism that is the target of an infecting action of a specific infectious agent is called the host. The host harbouring an agent that is in a mature or sexually active stage phase is called the definitive host. The intermediate host comes in contact during the larvae stage.

Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist, depending on the type of organism targeted; they include antibacterial ([[antibiotic]]; including [[Mycobacterium#Pathogenicity|antitubercular]]), [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]], [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] and [[antiparasitic]] (including [[antiprotozoal]] and [[antihelminthic]]) agents. Depending on the severity and the type of infection, the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection, or may be applied [[topical]]ly. Severe infections of the [[Human brain|brain]] are usually treated with [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] antibiotics. Sometimes, multiple antibiotics are used in case there is [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to one antibiotic. Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses. Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria. The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include [[penicillin]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[aminoglycoside]]s, [[macrolide]]s, [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]] and [[tetracycline]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nNot all infections require treatment, and for many [[self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]] infections the treatment may cause more side-effects than benefits. [[Antimicrobial stewardship]] is the concept that healthcare providers should treat an infection with an antimicrobial that specifically works well for the target pathogen for the shortest amount of time and to only treat when there is a known or highly suspected pathogen that will respond to the medication.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Deirdre J.|last2=Gould|first2=Ian M.|title=Maximizing the impact of antimicrobial stewardship|journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases|date=August 2013|volume=26|issue=4|pages=352\u201358|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283631046|pmid=23806898}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\n[[File:Infectious and parasitic diseases world map-Deaths per million persons-WHO2012.svg|upright=1.3|thumb|Deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases per million persons in 2012 {{refbegin|3}}{{legend|#ffff20|28-81}}{{legend|#ffe820|82-114}}{{legend|#ffd820|115-171}}{{legend|#ffc020|172-212}}{{legend|#ffa020|213-283}}{{legend|#ff9a20|284-516}}{{legend|#f08015|517-1,193}}{{legend|#e06815|1,194-2,476}}{{legend|#d85010|2,477-3,954}}{{legend|#d02010|3,955-6812}}{{refend}}]]\n[[File:Infectious and parasitic diseases world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Disability-adjusted life year]] for infectious and parasitic diseases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/gbddeathdalycountryestimates2004.xls |title=Age-standardized DALYs per 100,000 by cause, and Member State, 2004 |author=World Health Organization |authorlink=World Health Organization |date=February 2009}}\n</ref>{{refbegin|2}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|\u2264250}}\n{{legend|#fff200|250\u2013500}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|500\u20131000}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|1000\u20132000}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|2000\u20133000}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|3000\u20134000}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|4000\u20135000}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|5000\u20136250}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|6250\u201312,500}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|12,500\u201325,000}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|25,000\u201350,000}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|\u226550,000}}\n{{refend}}]]\n\nIn 2010, about 10 million people died of infectious diseases.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/1.2802071 |title=Could Ebola rank among the deadliest communicable diseases? |publisher=CBC News |date=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] collects information on global deaths by [[ICD|International Classification of Disease (ICD) code categories]].

Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by [[primary care]] physicians or [[internal medicine]] specialists. For example, an \"uncomplicated\" [[pneumonia]] will generally be treated by the [[internist]] or the [[pulmology|pulmonologist]] (lung physician). The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as [[Research|laboratory scientists]], [[immunology|immunologists]], [[bacteriology|bacteriologists]] and other specialists.\n\nAn infectious disease team may be alerted when:\n* The disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup\n* The patient is [[immunocompromised]] (for example, in [[AIDS]] or after [[chemotherapy]]);\n* The [[infectious agent]] is of an uncommon nature (e.g. [[tropical disease]]s);\n* The disease has not responded to first line [[antibiotic]]s;\n* The disease might be dangerous to other patients, and the patient might have to be isolated\n\n==Society and culture==\nA number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior. Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area. This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups, which may reduce pathogen transmission, or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior, which may reduce pathogen transmission. It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates. Higher [[fertility rate]]s and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate. There is also an association with [[polygyny]] which may be due to higher pathogen load, making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism, which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections. There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load. Thus, polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases. Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development.<ref name=\"pmid19683831\">{{cite journal | author = Nettle D | title = Ecological influences on human behavioural diversity: a review of recent findings | journal = Trends Ecol.

Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs. When present, however, these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body. A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur ''[[Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis]]'' exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone. The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived, non-lethal infection. Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another ''Herrerasaurus''. Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and a tyrannosaur from the [[Kirtland Formation]].

The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depend upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. However, a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection. Clinicians, therefore, classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as ''primary pathogens'' or as ''[[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]]'':\n; Primary pathogens\n: Primary pathogens cause disease as a result of their presence or activity within the normal, healthy host, and their intrinsic [[virulence]] (the severity of the disease they cause) is, in part, a necessary consequence of their need to reproduce and spread. Many of the most common primary pathogens of humans only infect humans, however, many serious diseases are caused by organisms acquired from the environment or that infect non-human hosts.\n; Opportunistic pathogens\n: Opportunistic pathogens can cause an infectious disease in a host with depressed resistance ([[immunodeficiency]]) or if they have unusual access to the inside of the body (for example, via [[Major trauma|trauma]]). [[Opportunistic infection]] may be caused by microbes ordinarily in contact with the host, such as [[pathogenic bacteria]] or fungi in the [[gastrointestinal]] or the [[upper respiratory tract]], and they may also result from (otherwise innocuous) microbes acquired from other hosts (as in ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' [[colitis]]) or from the environment as a result of [[Physical trauma|traumatic]] introduction (as in [[surgical]] wound infections or [[compound fracture]]s). An opportunistic disease requires impairment of host defenses, which may occur as a result of [[genetic defect]]s (such as [[Chronic granulomatous disease]]), exposure to [[antimicrobial]] drugs or [[immunosuppressive]] chemicals (as might occur following [[poison]]ing or [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy]]), exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity (such as with [[measles]], [[malaria]] or [[HIV disease]]). Primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host.<ref name=Sherris/>\n;{{anchor|Secondary infection}}Primary infection versus secondary infection\n: A primary infection is infection that is, or can practically be viewed as, the [[root cause]] of the current health problem. In contrast, a secondary infection is a [[sequela]] or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] of a root cause. For example, [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] is often a primary infection, but an infection that happened only because a [[burn]] or [[penetrating trauma]] (the root cause) allowed unusual access to deep tissues is a secondary infection. Primary pathogens often cause primary infection and also often cause secondary infection. Usually opportunistic infections are viewed as secondary infections (because immunodeficiency or [[injury]] was the predisposing factor).\n\n==== Other types of infection ====\nOther types of infection consist of mixed, iatrogenic, nosocomial, and community-acquired infection. A mixed infection is an infection that is cause by two or more pathogens. An example of this is Appendicitis, which is caused by Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli. The second is an iatrogenic infection. This type of infection is one that is transmitted from a health care worker to a patient. A nosocomial infection is also one that occurs in a health care setting. Nosocomial infections are those that are acquired during a hospital stay. Lastly a community-acquired infection is one in which the infection is acquired from a whole community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Infectious or not===\nOne manner of proving that a given disease is infectious, is to satisfy [[Koch's postulates]] (first proposed by [[Robert Koch]]), which require that first, the [[infectious agent]] be identifiable only in patients who have the disease, and not in healthy controls, and second, that patients who contract the infectious agent also develop the disease. These postulates were first used in the discovery that [[Mycobacteria]] species cause [[tuberculosis]].\n\nHowever, Koch's postulates cannot usually be tested in modern practice for ethical reasons. Proving them would require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a [[pathogen]] produced as a pure culture. Conversely, even clearly infectious diseases do not always meet the infectious criteria; for example, ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', the causative [[spirochete]] of [[syphilis]], cannot be [[microbiological culture|cultured]] ''in vitro'' \u2013 however the organism can be cultured in rabbit [[testes]]. It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture.\n\n[[Epidemiology]], or the study and analysis of in who, why and where disease occurs, and what determines whether various populations have a disease, is another important tool used to understand infectious disease. Epidemiologists may determine differences among groups within a population, such as whether certain age groups have a greater or lesser rate of infection; whether groups living in different neighborhoods are more likely to be infected; and by other factors, such as gender and race. Researchers also may assess whether a disease [[outbreak]] is sporadic, or just an occasional occurrence; [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], with a steady level of regular cases occurring in a region; [[epidemic]], with a fast arising, and unusually high number of cases in a region; or [[pandemic]], which is a global epidemic. If the cause of the infectious disease is unknown, epidemiology can be used to assist with tracking down the sources of infection.\n\n===Contagiousness===\nInfectious diseases are sometimes called contagious diseases when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions (e.g., [[influenza]]). Thus, a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted. Other types of infectious, transmissible, or communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection, such as vector transmission or sexual transmission, are usually not regarded as \"contagious\", and often do not require medical isolation (sometimes loosely called [[quarantine]]) of victims. However, this specialized connotation of the word \"contagious\" and \"contagious disease\" (easy transmissibility) is not always respected in popular use.\nInfectious diseases are commonly transmitted from person to person through direct contact. The types of contact are through person to person and droplet spread. Indirect contact such as airborne transmission, contaminated objects, food and drinking water, animal person contact, animal reservoirs, insect bites, and environmental reservoirs  are another way infectious diseases are transmitted.<ref>(Higurea & Pietrangelo 2016)</ref>\n\n===By anatomic location===\nInfections can be classified by the anatomic location or [[organ system]] infected, including:\n* [[Urinary tract infection]]\n* [[Skin infection]]\n* [[Respiratory tract infection]]\n* [[Odontogenic infection]] (an infection that originates within a [[tooth]] or in the closely surrounding tissues)\n* [[Vaginal infections]]\n* [[Intra-amniotic infection]]\nIn addition, locations of [[inflammation]] where infection is the most common cause include [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and [[salpingitis]].\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe symptoms of an infection depend on the type of disease. Some signs of infection affect the whole body generally, such as [[fatigue]], loss of appetite, weight loss, [[fever]]s, night sweats, chills, aches and pains. Others are specific to individual body parts, such as skin [[rash]]es, [[cough]]ing, or a [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]].\n\nIn certain cases, infectious diseases may be [[asymptomatic]] for much or even all of their course in a given host. In the latter case, the disease may only be defined as a \"disease\" (which by definition means an illness) in hosts who secondarily become ill after contact with an asymptomatic carrier. An infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease, as some infections do not cause illness in a host.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\n===Bacterial or viral===\nAs bacterial and viral infections can both cause the same kinds of symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish which is the cause of a specific infection.<ref name=nipa>[http://www.antibiotics-info.org/bact02.asp \"Bacterial vs. Viral Infections \u2013 Do You Know the Difference?\"] National Information Program on Antibiotics</ref> Distinguishing the two is important, since viral infections cannot be cured by [[antibiotic]]s whereas bacterial infections can.<ref>{{cite book| title =The Truth About Illness and Disease|author1=Robert N.

Characteristic\n! [[Viral disease|Viral infection]]\n! [[Pathogenic bacteria|Bacterial infection]]\n|-\n|| Typical symptoms\n| In general, viral infections are systemic. This means they involve many different parts of the body or more than one body system at the same time; i.e. a runny nose, sinus congestion, cough, body aches etc. They can be local at times as in viral [[conjunctivitis]] or \"pink eye\" and herpes. Only a few viral infections are painful, like herpes. The pain of viral infections is often described as itchy or burning.<ref name=\"nipa\"/>\n| The classic symptoms of a bacterial infection are localized redness, heat, swelling and pain. One of the hallmarks of a bacterial infection is local pain, pain that is in a specific part of the body.

This is referred to as colonization. Most humans are not easily infected. Those with compromised or weakened immune systems have an increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections. Individuals who have a suppressed [[immune system]] are particularly susceptible to [[opportunistic infection]]s. Entrance to the host at [[host-pathogen interface]], generally occurs through the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] in orifices like the [[oral cavity]], nose, eyes, genitalia, anus, or the microbe can enter through open wounds. While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry, many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs. Some pathogens grow within the host cells (intracellular) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids.\n\n[[Wound]] colonization refers to non-replicating microorganisms within the wound, while in infected wounds, replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Negut|first=Irina|last2=Grumezescu|first2=Valentina|last3=Grumezescu|first3=Alexandru Mihai|date=2018-09-18|title=Treatment Strategies for Infected Wounds|journal=Molecules : A Journal of Synthetic Chemistry and Natural Product Chemistry|volume=23|issue=9|doi=10.3390/molecules23092392|issn=1420-3049|pmc=6225154|pmid=30231567|page=2392}}</ref>. All [[multicellular organism]]s are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms, and the vast majority of these exist in either a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[commensal]] relationship with the host. An example of the former is the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] species, which colonizes the [[mammal]]ian [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], and an example of the latter are the various species of [[staphylococcus]] that exist on [[human skin]]. Neither of these colonizations are considered infections. The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance. Non-pathogenic organisms can become pathogenic given specific conditions, and even the most [[virulent]] organism requires certain circumstances to cause a compromising infection. Some colonizing bacteria, such as ''[[Corynebacteria]] sp.'' and ''[[viridans streptococci]]'', prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria and thus have a symbiotic relationship with the host, preventing infection and speeding [[wound healing]].\n[[File:Pathogenic Infection.png|thumb|<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duerkop|first=Breck A|last2=Hooper|first2=Lora V|date=2013-07-01|title=Resident viruses and their interactions with the immune system|journal=Nature Immunology|language=en|volume=14|issue=7|pages=654\u201359|doi=10.1038/ni.2614|pmc=3760236|pmid=23778792}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studyblue.com/notes/note/n/bacterial-pathogenesis/deck/11094651|title=Bacterial Pathogenesis at Washington University |location= St. Louis|website=StudyBlue|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2014/6/the-dangers-of-using-antibiotics-to-prevent-urinary-tract-infections/page-01?p=1|title=Print Friendly|website=www.lifeextension.com|access-date=2016-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202235200/http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2014/6/the-dangers-of-using-antibiotics-to-prevent-urinary-tract-infections/page-01?p=1|archive-date=2016-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> This image depicts the steps of pathogenic infection.]]\nThe variables involved in the outcome of a host becoming inoculated by a pathogen and the ultimate outcome include:\n* the route of entry of the [[pathogen]] and the access to host regions that it gains\n* the intrinsic [[virulence]] of the particular organism\n* the quantity or load of the initial inoculant\n* the [[immune system|immune]] status of the host being colonized\n\nAs an example, several [[staphylococcus|staphylococcal]] species remain harmless on the skin, but, when present in a normally [[sterile technique|sterile]] space, such as in the capsule of a [[joint]] or the [[peritoneum]], multiply without resistance and cause harm.\n\nAn interesting fact that [[gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry]], [[16S ribosomal RNA]] analysis, [[omics]], and other advanced technologies have made more apparent to humans in recent decades is that microbial colonization is very common even in environments that humans think of as being nearly [[asepsis|sterile]]. Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization, it is difficult to know which chronic wounds can be classified as infected and how much risk of progression exists. Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice, there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs. A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association's \"Rational Clinical Examination Series\" quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reddy M, Gill SS, Wu W | date = Feb 2012 | title = Does this patient have an infection of a chronic wound? | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 307 | issue = 6| pages = 605\u201311 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.98 | pmid = 22318282 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [likelihood ratio (LR) range, 11\u201320] makes infection much more likely, but the absence of pain (negative likelihood ratio range, 0.64\u20130.88) does not rule out infection (summary LR 0.64\u20130.88).\n\n===Disease===\n[[Disease]] can arise if the host's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host. [[Microorganism]]s can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes. For example, ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'' releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles, and [[staphylococcus]] releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis. Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts. For example, less than 5% of individuals infected with [[polio]] develop disease.<ref>http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4215.pdf</ref> On the other hand, some infectious agents are highly virulent. The [[prion]] causing [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] invariably kills all animals and people that are infected.\n\nPersistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection. Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism, often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection. There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body. Some viruses once acquired never leave the body. A typical example is the herpes virus, which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise.\n\nPersistent infections cause millions of deaths globally each year.<ref>[http://www.persistentinfection.net/ Chronic Infection Information] Retrieved on 2010-01-14 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722065612/http://www.persistentinfection.net/ |date=July 22, 2015 }}</ref> Chronic infections by parasites account for a high morbidity and mortality in many underdeveloped countries.\n\n===Transmission<!--linked from 'Transmission (medicine)'-->===\n{{Main|Transmission (medicine)}}\n[[File:CulexNil.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A southern house mosquito (''[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]'') is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] that transmits the pathogens that cause [[West Nile fever]] and [[avian malaria]] among others.]]For infecting organisms to survive and repeat the infection cycle in other hosts, they (or their progeny) must leave an existing reservoir and cause infection elsewhere.

''MetaPathogen.com''.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between ''[[optimal virulence|virulence versus transmissibility]]'' is complex; if a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}\nDiagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly. In practice most minor infectious diseases such as [[wart]]s, [[cutaneous]] [[abscesses]], [[respiratory system]] infections and [[diarrheal diseases]] are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent. Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent, the presence of a microbe in a community, and other epidemiological considerations. Given sufficient effort, all known infectious agents can be specifically identified. The benefits of identification, however, are often greatly outweighed by the cost, as often there is no specific treatment, the cause is obvious, or the outcome of an infection is [[benign]].\n\nDiagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by [[medical history]] and physical examination. More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient. Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features, by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens, and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype. Other techniques (such as [[X-ray]]s, [[CAT scans]], [[PET scan]]s or [[NMR]]) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent. The images are useful in detection of, for example, a bone [[abscess]] or a [[spongiform encephalopathy]] produced by a [[prion]].\n\n===Symptomatic diagnostics===\nThe diagnosis is aided by the presenting symptoms in any individual with an infectious disease, yet it usually needs additional diagnostic techniques to confirm the suspicion. Some signs are specifically characteristic and indicative of a disease and are called [[pathognomonic]] signs; but these are rare. Not all infections are symptomatic.<ref name=Sternak>{{cite journal|last1=Ljubin-Sternak|first1=Suncanica|last2=Mestrovic|first2=Tomislav|title=Review: Clamydia trachonmatis and Genital Mycoplasmias: Pathogens with an Impact on Human Reproductive Health|journal=Journal of Pathogens|page=3 |date=2014|volume=2014|issue=183167|doi=10.1155/2014/183167|pmid=25614838|pmc=4295611}}</ref>\n\nIn children the presence of [[cyanosis]], rapid breathing, poor peripheral perfusion, or a [[petechial rash]] increases the risk of a serious infection by greater than 5 fold.<ref name=Lancet10>{{cite journal |vauthors=Van den Bruel A, Haj-Hassan T, Thompson M, Buntinx F, Mant D | title = Diagnostic value of clinical features at presentation to identify serious infection in children in developed countries: a systematic review | journal = Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9717 | pages = 834\u201345 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20132979 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)62000-6 | url =  }}</ref> Other important indicators include parental concern, clinical instinct, and temperature greater than 40&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Lancet10/>\n\n===Microbial culture===\n[[File:K pneumoniae M morganii providencia styphimuriuma.JPG|thumb|200px|Four [[nutrient agar]] plates growing colonies of common [[Gram negative]] bacteria.]]\n[[Microbiological culture]] is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a [[growth medium]] is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient [[Agar#Microbiology|agar]], a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a [[bacterium]], along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a [[Colony (biology)|colony]], which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \"lawn\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its [[Strain (biology)|strain]]), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of [[virus]]es: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a \"plaque\". [[Eukaryotic]] [[parasites]] may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent.\n\nIn the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals. Bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' and ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in [[embryo]]nated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. [[Chagas disease]] is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of the Chagas agent ''T. cruzi'', an uninfected [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of ''T. cruzi'' within its gut.\n\n===Microscopy===\nAnother principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is [[microscopy]]. Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely, at some point, on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent. Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments, such as the compound [[light microscope]], or with instruments as complex as an [[electron microscope]]. Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope, and can often rapidly lead to identification. Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with [[biochemical]] [[staining]] techniques, and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with [[antibody]] based techniques. For example, the use of [[Antibody|antibodies]] made artificially [[fluorescent]] (fluorescently labeled antibodies) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific [[antigen]]s present on a pathogen. A [[fluorescence microscope]] is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells. This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases, where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly.\n\nOther microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents. Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic [[dye]]s due to the [[electrostatic]] attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye. A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background. Staining a cell with a dye such as [[Giemsa]] stain or [[crystal violet]] allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells. The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the [[taxonomic classification]] of microbes as well. Two methods, the [[Gram stain]] and the [[acid-fast]] stain, are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease. The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]], both of which contain many significant human pathogens. The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' and ''[[Nocardia]]''.\n\n===Biochemical tests===\nBiochemical tests used in the identification of infectious agents include the detection of [[metabolic]] or [[enzymatic]] products characteristic of a particular infectious agent. Since bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s in patterns characteristic of their [[genus]] and [[species]], the detection of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products is commonly used in bacterial identification. [[Acids]], [[alcohols]] and [[gases]] are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in [[Growth medium#Selective media|selective]] liquid or solid media.\n\nThe isolation of [[enzymes]] from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease. For example, humans can make neither [[RNA replicase]]s nor [[reverse transcriptase]], and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic., of specific types of viral infections. The ability of the viral protein [[hemagglutinin]] to bind [[red blood cells]] together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection, although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an ''enzyme'' and has no metabolic function.\n\n[[Serological]] methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms. These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen. The antigen, usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent, is bound by the antibody. This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways, dependent upon the test. For example, \"[[Strep throat]]\" is often diagnosed within minutes, and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent, ''[[S. pyogenes]]'', that is retrieved from a patient's throat with a cotton swab. Serological tests, if available, are usually the preferred route of identification, however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require [[refrigeration]]. Some serological methods are extremely costly, although when commonly used, such as with the \"strep test\", they can be inexpensive.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\nComplex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as [[Immunoassays]]. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody \u2013 antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro-magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.\n\nInstrumentation can be used to read extremely small signals created by secondary reactions linked to the antibody \u2013 antigen binding. Instrumentation can control sampling, reagent use, reaction times, signal detection, calculation of results, and data management to yield a cost-effective automated process for diagnosis of infectious disease.\n\n===PCR-based diagnostics===\nTechnologies based upon the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future, for several reasons. First, the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified. Second, an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease. This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR. Third, the essential tools for directing PCR, [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], are derived from the [[genomes]] of infectious agents, and with time those genomes will be known, if they are not already.\n\nThus, the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available. The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application, neither of which is insurmountable. The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods, such as some of the [[clostridia]]l diseases ([[tetanus]] and [[botulism]]). These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent [[neurotoxin]]s. A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur, this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria.\n\n===Metagenomic sequencing===\nGiven the wide range of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that cause debilitating and life-threatening illness, the ability to quickly identify the cause of infection is important yet often challenging. For example, more than half of cases of [[encephalitis]], a severe illness affecting the brain, remain undiagnosed, despite extensive testing using state-of-the-art clinical laboratory methods. [[Metagenomics]] is currently being researched for clinical use, and shows promise as a sensitive and rapid way to diagnose infection using a single all-encompassing test. This test is similar to current PCR tests; however, amplification of genetic material is unbiased rather than using [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for a specific infectious agent. This amplification step is followed by next-generation sequencing and [[Sequence alignment|alignment comparisons]] using large databases of thousands of organismic and viral genomes.\n\nMetagenomic sequencing could prove especially useful for diagnosis when the patient is [[immunocompromised]]. An ever-wider array of infectious agents can cause serious harm to individuals with immunosuppression, so clinical screening must often be broader. Additionally, the expression of symptoms is often atypical, making clinical diagnosis based on presentation more difficult. Thirdly, diagnostic methods that rely on the detection of antibodies are more likely to fail. A broad, sensitive test for pathogens that detects the presence of infectious material rather than antibodies is therefore highly desirable.\n\n===Indication of tests===\nThere is usually an [[indication (medicine)|indication]] for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease, or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures. For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of [[Zidovudine|AZT]] for the treatment of [[AIDS]], the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of [[HIV]] in specific communities permitted the advancement of [[hypotheses]] as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific [[serological]] diagnostic identification, and later [[genotypic]] or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the [[Time|temporal]] and [[geographic]]al origins of the virus, as well as a myriad of other hypothesis.<ref name=Sherris/> The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with [[anti-retroviral drugs]]. Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection. Thus, while there still is no cure for AIDS, there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals, both for the patient and for the community at large.\n\n==Prevention==\n{{main|Public health|Infection control}}\n[[File:OCD handwash.jpg|thumb|right|Washing one's hands, a form of [[hygiene]], is an effective way to prevent the spread of infectious disease.<ref name=handhygiene>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bloomfield SF, Aiello AE, Cookson B, O'Boyle C, Larson EL|url=http://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(07)00595-0/fulltext|title=The effectiveness of hand hygiene procedures including hand-washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the risks of infections in home and community settings|journal=American Journal of Infection Control|year=2007|volume=35|issue=10|pages=S27\u2013S64|doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2007.07.001}}</ref>]]\nTechniques like hand washing, wearing gowns, and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another.

Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important.\n\n[[Antimicrobials|Antimicrobial substances]] used to prevent transmission of infections include:\n* [[antiseptics]], which are applied to living [[biological tissue|tissue]]/[[skin]]\n* [[disinfectant]]s, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.\n* [[antibiotic]]s, called [[prophylactic]] when given as prevention rather as treatment of infection. However, long term use of antibiotics leads to resistance of bacteria. While humans do not become immune to antibiotics, the bacteria does. Thus, avoiding using antibiotics longer than necessary helps preventing bacteria from forming mutations that aide in antibiotic resistance.\n\nOne of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases.<ref name=Watts>{{cite book |author=Watts, Duncan |title=Six degrees: the science of a connected age |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-04142-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sixdegrees00dunc }}</ref> Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include [[virulence]], distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of [[Ebola]] virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone.<ref>{{cite book |author=Preston, Richard |title=The hot zone |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y. |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=978-0-385-49522-6 }}</ref> Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of [[Ebola]] is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] ([[HIV]]) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book |veditors=Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}</ref> As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an [[epidemic]].\n\nAnother effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of [[small-world networks]].<ref name=Watts/> In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. <sup>[6]</sup>{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}} Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the [[foot-and-mouth]] virus in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferguson NM, Donnelly CA, Anderson RM | title = The foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain: pattern of spread and impact of interventions | journal = Science | volume = 292 | issue = 5519 | pages = 1155\u201360 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11303090 | doi = 10.1126/science.1061020 | bibcode = 2001Sci...292.1155F | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d996865b2e6ac1ee4d5931ce0ca6d43d84879c9b }}</ref>\n\nA general method to prevent transmission of [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne pathogens is [[pest control]].\n\nIn cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, to control an epidemic.\n\n===Immunity===\n[[File:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Mallon]] (a.k.a. Typhoid Mary) was an asymptomatic carrier of [[typhoid fever]]. Over the course of her career as a cook, she infected 53 people, three of whom died.]]\nInfection with most pathogens does not result in death of the host and the offending organism is ultimately cleared after the symptoms of the disease have waned.<ref name= Baron/> This process requires [[immune system|immune mechanisms]] to kill or inactivate the [[Inoculation|inoculum]] of the pathogen. Specific acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against infectious diseases may be mediated by [[Antibody|antibodies]] and/or [[T lymphocyte]]s. Immunity mediated by these two factors may be manifested by:\n* a direct effect upon a pathogen, such as antibody-initiated [[complement system|complement]]-dependent bacteriolysis, [[Opsonin|opsonoization]], [[phagocytosis]] and killing, as occurs for some bacteria,\n* neutralization of viruses so that these organisms cannot enter cells,\n* or by T lymphocytes, which will kill a cell parasitized by a microorganism.\n\nThe immune system response to a microorganism often causes symptoms such as a high [[fever]] and [[inflammation]], and has the potential to be more devastating than direct damage caused by a microbe.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\nResistance to infection ([[immunity (medical)|immunity]]) may be acquired following a disease, by [[asymptomatic carrier|asymptomatic carriage]] of the pathogen, by harboring an organism with a similar structure (crossreacting), or by [[vaccination]]. Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for [[opportunistic pathogen]]s.\nThere is also the phenomenon of [[herd immunity]] which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections.\n\nImmune resistance to an infectious disease requires a critical level of either antigen-specific antibodies and/or T cells when the host encounters the pathogen. Some individuals develop natural [[blood plasma|serum]] antibodies to the surface [[polysaccharide]]s of some agents although they have had little or no contact with the agent, these natural antibodies confer specific protection to adults and are [[passive immunization|passively transmitted]] to newborns.\n\n====Host genetic factors====\nThe organism that is the target of an infecting action of a specific infectious agent is called the host. The host harbouring an agent that is in a mature or sexually active stage phase is called the definitive host. The intermediate host comes in contact during the larvae stage. A host can be anything living and can attain to asexual and sexual reproduction.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Barreto ML, Teixeira MG, Carmo EH|year=2006|title=Infectious diseases epidemiology|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=60|issue=3|pages=192\u201395|doi=10.1136/jech.2003.011593|pmc=2465549|pmid=16476746}}</ref>\nThe clearance of the pathogens, either treatment-induced or spontaneous, it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients.

Several broad types of anti-infective drugs exist, depending on the type of organism targeted; they include antibacterial ([[antibiotic]]; including [[Mycobacterium#Pathogenicity|antitubercular]]), [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]], [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] and [[antiparasitic]] (including [[antiprotozoal]] and [[antihelminthic]]) agents. Depending on the severity and the type of infection, the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection, or may be applied [[topical]]ly. Severe infections of the [[Human brain|brain]] are usually treated with [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] antibiotics. Sometimes, multiple antibiotics are used in case there is [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to one antibiotic. Antibiotics only work for bacteria and do not affect viruses. Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria. The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include [[penicillin]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[aminoglycoside]]s, [[macrolide]]s, [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]] and [[tetracycline]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nNot all infections require treatment, and for many [[self-limiting (biology)|self-limiting]] infections the treatment may cause more side-effects than benefits.

[[Robert Koch]], provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as [[Koch's postulates]]. [[Edward Jenner]], [[Jonas Salk]] and [[Albert Sabin]] developed effective vaccines for [[smallpox]] and [[polio]], which would later result in the [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] and near-eradication of these diseases, respectively. [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the world's first [[antibiotic]], [[Penicillin]], which Florey and Chain then developed. [[Gerhard Domagk]] developed [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], the first broad spectrum [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial drugs.\n\n===Medical specialists===\nThe [[medicine|medical treatment]] of infectious diseases falls into the [[specialty (medicine)|medical field]] of [[infectious disease (medical specialty)|Infectious Disease]] and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of [[Epidemiology]]. Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by [[primary care]] physicians or [[internal medicine]] specialists. For example, an \"uncomplicated\" [[pneumonia]] will generally be treated by the [[internist]] or the [[pulmology|pulmonologist]] (lung physician). The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as [[Research|laboratory scientists]], [[immunology|immunologists]], [[bacteriology|bacteriologists]] and other specialists.\n\nAn infectious disease team may be alerted when:\n* The disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup\n* The patient is [[immunocompromised]] (for example, in [[AIDS]] or after [[chemotherapy]]);\n* The [[infectious agent]] is of an uncommon nature (e.g. [[tropical disease]]s);\n* The disease has not responded to first line [[antibiotic]]s;\n* The disease might be dangerous to other patients, and the patient might have to be isolated\n\n==Society and culture==\nA number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior. Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area. This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups, which may reduce pathogen transmission, or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior, which may reduce pathogen transmission. It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates. Higher [[fertility rate]]s and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate. There is also an association with [[polygyny]] which may be due to higher pathogen load, making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism, which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections. There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load. Thus, polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases. Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development.<ref name=\"pmid19683831\">{{cite journal | author = Nettle D | title = Ecological influences on human behavioural diversity: a review of recent findings | journal = Trends Ecol.

Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs. When present, however, these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body. A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur ''[[Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis]]'' exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone. The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were afflicted by a short-lived, non-lethal infection. Scientists who studied the skull speculated that the bite marks were received in a fight with another ''Herrerasaurus''. Other carnivorous dinosaurs with documented evidence of infection include ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and a tyrannosaur from the [[Kirtland Formation]]. The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight, like the ''Herrerasaurus'' specimen.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R.
