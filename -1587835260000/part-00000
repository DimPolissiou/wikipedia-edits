{"title_page": "Spy (2004 TV series)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{distinguish|Spy (2011 TV series)}}\n'''''Spy''''' is a British television programme originally made by [[Wall to Wall (production company)|Wall to Wall]] for [[BBC Three]] in 2004. It has been one of the most-exported United Kingdom television shows; according to the [[Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television]] (PACT), it had been sold to 129 countries by April 2005.\n\nThe series follows a group of real-life volunteers as they are trained by former spies in espionage techniques, including maintaining a false identity, surveillance, persuasion and recruitment. The programme's psychological challenges, dramatic tension, high production values, and personable cast led to its being called 'the most addictive thing on TV at the moment' by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.\n\nThe series further develops a format that first appeared in the Wall to Wall television productions '''''Spymaster''''' (2002; UK) and '''''[[Spymaster USA]]''''' (2003; USA).\n\n''SPY: A Handbook'', a companion book written by Harry Ferguson, a trainer featured on the show, was published in 2004 by Bloomsbury in the UK ({{ISBN|0-7475-7523-1}}).\n\n== Candidates and competition ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spy - Harry Ferguson & Sandy Williams.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Spy trainers Ferguson & Williams]] -->\nOver 5,000 candidates from across the United Kingdom applied to be on the show. The candidates were narrowed down to a pool of eight recruits before the start of the show. As the show progressed, recruits who failed to demonstrate sufficient potential as agents were unceremoniously dismissed from the competition.\n\nIn the final episode, Nicola Jackson emerged as the winner, but there was no prize other than the satisfaction of knowing that they had what it takes to be a real spy.\n\nThe recruits, in alphabetical order, were:\n\n* Daoh, Andrew (19, male)\n* Dhiri, Reena (28, female)\n* Dilworth, Simon (35, male)\n* Glantz, Suzi (58, female)\n* Jackson, Nicola (24, female)\n* Moule, Jennie (27, female)\n* van Schweiger, Max (35, male)\n* Winn, Gabriel (24, male)\n\nThe three experts, called their \"tutors\", who devised the training missions, trained the recruits, and evaluated their performance were:\n\n* [[Mike Baker (CIA officer)|Mike Baker]], a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] field operations officer\n* Sandy Williams, a former [[Intelligence Officer]]\n* Harry Ferguson, formerly of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]\n\nAdditional training was conducted by John Potter, and narration was provided by [[Paul Brightwell]].\n\n== Episodes ==\nTen hour-long episodes were originally produced. The show was then recut into a series of 15 half-hour episodes. Broadcasters in some markets air the original series, while broadcasters in other markets air the other.\n\nSummaries published for the original ten episodes follow:\n\n; #101 &mdash; Into the Unknown : Stripped of their old identities, the raw recruits meet for the first time in London on day one. They receive their first briefing from their 'tutors.' With no time to unpack, they are sent on their first mission: a real test used by [[Mossad]], the Israeli Secret Service. They are given just 10 minutes to talk their way into a stranger\u2019s flat and be seen by their trainers drinking a glass of water on the balcony. After only 24 hours on the course, the recruits must learn a vital lesson: every spy can break under pressure. Without warning they are abducted from their safe-houses in the middle of the night and interrogated by intelligence professionals. They must stick to their cover names and avoid giving away any details about their real lives.\n; #102 &mdash; Open Your Eyes : The wannabe spies hone their skills at 'going grey' - the art of mingling in a crowd without being noticed. The trainers instruct them in using effective body language and building an instant rapport with strangers. The recruits then embark on their toughest mission yet, which will test their skills of persuasion, nerve and the ability to think on their feet. They attempt to gain access to an office building (during working hours) and take photographs of confidential documents without getting caught.\n; #103 &mdash; Under Cover : The greatest spies in history are those who blend effortlessly into any new environment. Will the recruits be up to the job? Their mission brief is simple \u2013 go undercover, assume a new identity and fool those around them into believing that they\u2019re someone they\u2019re not. Their trainers, real former spies, are monitoring their progress and have a devious trap to find the recruits out. Will all of them make it through?\n; #104 &mdash; The Confidence of Strangers : The recruits continue their quest to master the spying game. Following the dismissal of the first candidate, the remaining recruits struggle with their feelings as they are taught the ruthless art of cultivation - how to lie and manipulate others. Whether it\u2019s gaining confidential information from a hotel receptionist or getting a total stranger to look after a sensitive document for them, the recruits will need all their skills of charm and persuasion to pull it off. The recruits\u2019 final, highly confidential mission is to win the trust of each other\u2019s nearest and dearest. They are to manipulate the person to gain entry into the family home and photograph the master bedroom without being detected.\n; #105 &mdash; Too Close for Comfort : The art of surveillance is a core skill for any would-be spy. Working in teams, the recruits practice the basics of following targets without being noticed or drawing attention to themselves. The would-be spies are tested as the trainers watch and judge them on their triumphs and failures. For their latest mission, the recruits must use all their spy skills and put their professionalism to the ultimate test in a one-on-one surveillance mission in Brighton. They don\u2019t realize until the last minute that their target is actually their closest friend or family member whom they haven\u2019t been allowed to see since starting the course. If they allow their personal feelings to compromise the mission, they risk being thrown out of spy school.\n; #106 &mdash; Safe as Houses : Having mastered observation and surveillance skills, the recruits are now faced with their first 36-hour mission. They have to mount a surveillance operation on the occupants of two target houses. They must break into target properties, plant secret cameras and bugs and fix tracking devices to cars. Split into teams, the recruits\u2019 relationships are put to the test as they share cramped and claustrophobic living conditions for the duration of their stake-out.\n; #107 &mdash; Crossing the Line : The art of cultivating an agent is the core work of an intelligence officer. Teaming up in pairs, the six remaining recruits take temporary jobs at a barber shop, a gym and a clothing store. Their fellow employees are unaware that their new coworkers are spies. After working undercover cultivating and befriending a complete stranger in order to turn them into their agent, it is time for the recruits to complete their mission. They will have to manipulate their target and get them to cross the line of morality, by persuading them to lie, sign a fake document or help them in a legally questionable way.\n; #108 &mdash; The Enemy Within : After six weeks on the course, the recruits have learned to rely on each other and have come to appreciate the value of trust and collaboration. But this time they will have to embrace the darker side of spying: betrayal. Two recruits are the subjects of internal investigations and it is up to their fellow spies to set a trap and gather incriminating evidence. For some this will mean the end of the course. Spy school is closed and the recruits are about to graduate to their final mission, but first they must pass the ultimate test of loyalty. They find out what it\u2019s like when a spy thinks their organization has turned against them, and that they\u2019ve been left out in the cold.\n; #109 &mdash; Out in the Cold : The tension mounts as the four remaining recruits are exposed to their most dangerous scenario to date and their loyalty is tested to the limit. The trainers have assigned all the recruits a mission that is truly impossible. Each recruit is led to believe that, having failed, they must leave the project. The recruits must keep their heads among false sex scandals and offers of vast sums of money from PR consultant Max Clifford. At their most vulnerable, will they give in to greed and hunger for instant fame, fall into the trap and betray their organization by selling secrets to the tabloids? As in the real world of espionage, any recruit who betrays their organization will face the consequences.\n; #110 &mdash; End Game : The final three recruits have been tested to their limits and beyond in their bid to come to grips with the spying game. With their training now complete, the trio must undertake a final confidential mission abroad, working against professionals. Without the support of their trainers and unsure if they can trust each other, they must complete their mission without being detected by their target or the local authorities. There is also a final twist in the tale, as the recruits and their cameraman are taken by police for questioning at local jail. Only one recruit will return from this mission as the perfect spy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aldwych tube station]], where portions of the show were produced\n* [[Lindsay Moran]], book details some training corresponding to the show\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060220191357/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/spy/index.shtml Spy] information on BBC Three (archived)\n*[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/488121/591184/ Spy] information on New Zealand TV One\n*{{UKGameshow|Spy|Spy}}\n\n[[Category:BBC Television programmes|Spy]]\n[[Category:2000s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:2004 British television series debuts]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{distinguish|Spy (2011 TV series)}}\n'''''Spy''''' is a British television programme originally made by [[Wall to Wall (production company)|Wall to Wall]] for [[BBC Three]] in 2004.

The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use [[3D modelling]] software to generate [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house [[stereolithography]] machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the \"validation\" process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the [[focus groups]]. [[Virtual model]]s of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the user instructions.

Jr.FLL and FLL offer real-world engineering challenges to participants. FLL uses Lego-based robots to complete tasks. Jr.FLL participants build models out of Lego elements. In its 2010 season, there were 16,070 FLL teams in over 55 countries. In its 2010 season, there were 2,147 Jr.FLL teams with 12,882 total student participants in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego's Future Lab, the Danish toy company's experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company's robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|title=The Lego prosthetic arm that children can create and hack themselves|first=Oliver|last=Wainwright|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723183344/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|title=IKO Creative Prosthetic System|work=[[Core77]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723184938/http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Clones of Lego ==\n{{Main|Lego clone}}\nThe definitive shape of the Lego bricks, with the inner tubes, was patented by the Lego Group in 1958.<ref name=\"Time50Years\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Austen|first1=Ian|title=Building a Legal Case, Block by Block|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 January 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122304/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Several competitors have attempted to take advantage of Lego's popularity by producing blocks of similar dimensions, and advertising them as being compatible with Lego bricks.

The company also has smaller design offices in the UK, Spain, Germany, and Japan which are tasked with developing products aimed specifically at these markets. The average development period for a new product is around twelve months, split into three stages. The first stage is to identify market trends and developments, including contact by the designers directly with the market; some are stationed in toy shops close to holidays, while others interview children. The second stage is the design and development of the product based upon the results of the first stage. As of September 2008 the design teams use [[3D modelling]] software to generate [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings from initial design sketches. The designs are then prototyped using an in-house [[stereolithography]] machine. These prototypes are presented to the entire project team for comment and for testing by parents and children during the \"validation\" process. Designs may then be altered in accordance with the results from the [[focus groups]]. [[Virtual model]]s of completed Lego products are built concurrently with the writing of the user instructions. Completed CAD models are also used in the wider organisation, for marketing and packaging.<ref name=\"3d\">{{Cite journal|title=Child's Play|author=Frances Corbet|journal=Develop 3D|publisher=X3DMedia|pages=25\u201327|date=September 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Lego Digital Designer]] is an official piece of Lego software for [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] which allows users to create their own digital Lego designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ldd.lego.com/|title=LEGO Digital Designer|publisher=LEGO|date=n.d.|accessdate=29 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403211318/http://ldd.lego.com/|archivedate=3 April 2013}}</ref> The program once allowed customers to order their custom designs<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buildwithchrome.com/|title=Build with Chrome|publisher=[[Google]]|date=n.d.|accessdate=29 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329025051/https://www.buildwithchrome.com/|archivedate=29 March 2014}}</ref> with a [[Lego Design byME|service to ship physical models]] from Digital Designer to consumers; the service ended in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ldd.lego.com/da-dk/subpages/designbyme|title=What happened to DESIGN byME?|publisher=LEGO|date=n.d.|accessdate=29 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124160022/http://ldd.lego.com/subpages/designbyme/|archivedate=24 January 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Manufacturing ==\n[[File:Kladno CZ LEGO factory from NE 007.jpg|thumb|right|The Lego factory in [[Kladno]], Czech Republic]]\n[[File:Arburg Lego.png|thumb|right|Lego injection moulding machines, made by the German company [[Arburg]]]]\nSince 1963, Lego pieces have been manufactured from a strong, resilient plastic known as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS).<ref name=\"Pickering15\" /><ref name=\"Companyprofile\" /> As of September 2008, Lego engineers use the [[NX (software)|NX]] [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]/[[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] [[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]] software suite to model the elements.

The roots of the product originate from a programmable brick developed at the [[MIT Media Lab]], and the name is taken from a paper by [[Seymour Papert]], a computer scientist and educator who developed the educational theory of [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionism]], and whose research was at times funded by the [[Lego Group]].<ref name=\"Mindstorms History\">{{cite web|title=Mindstorms History|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/history|website=Lego|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831053906/http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/history|archivedate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe programmable Lego brick which is at the heart of these robotics sets has undergone several updates and redesigns, with the latest being called the 'EV3' brick, being sold under the name of Lego Mindstorms EV3. The set includes sensors that detect touch, light, sound and ultrasonic waves, with several others being sold separately, including an [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] reader.<ref name=\"About EV3\">{{cite web|title=About EV3|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/about-ev3|website=Lego|accessdate=6 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905160032/http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/about-ev3|archivedate=5 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe intelligent brick can be programmed using official software available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X|Mac]] computers, and is downloaded onto the brick via [[Bluetooth]] or a USB cable. There are also several unofficial programs and compatible programming languages that have been made to work with the brick, and many books have been written to support this community.<ref name=\"About EV3\" />\n\nThere are several robotics competitions which use the Lego robotics sets. The earliest is [[Botball]], a national U.S. [[middle school|middle]]- and [[high-school]] competition stemming from the MIT 6.270 Lego robotics tournament. Other Lego robotics competitions include [[FIRST Lego League Jr.|Junior FIRST LEGO League]] (Jr.FLL) for students ages 6\u20139 and [[FIRST Lego League]] (FLL) for students ages 9\u201316 (age 9\u201314 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico). Jr.FLL and FLL offer real-world engineering challenges to participants. FLL uses Lego-based robots to complete tasks. Jr.FLL participants build models out of Lego elements. In its 2010 season, there were 16,070 FLL teams in over 55 countries. In its 2010 season, there were 2,147 Jr.FLL teams with 12,882 total student participants in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The international [[RoboCup Junior]] [[Association football|football]] competition involves extensive use of [[Lego Mindstorms]] equipment which is often pushed to its extreme limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usfirst.org|title=USFIRST.org|publisher=USFIRST.org|accessdate=3 October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003051426/http://www.usfirst.org/|archivedate=3 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe capabilities of the Mindstorms range have now been harnessed for use in Iko Creative Prosthetic System, a prosthetic limbs system designed for children. Designs for these Lego prosthetics allow everything from mechanical diggers to laser-firing spaceships to be screwed on to the end of a child's limb. Iko is the work of the Chicago-based Colombian designer Carlos Arturo Torres, and is a modular system that allows children to customise their own prosthetics with the ease of clicking together plastic bricks. Designed with Lego's Future Lab, the Danish toy company's experimental research department, and Cirec, a Colombian foundation for physical rehabilitation, the modular prosthetic incorporates myoelectric sensors that register the activity of the muscle in the stump and send a signal to control movement in the attachment. A processing unit in the body of the prosthetic contains an engine compatible with Lego Mindstorms, the company's robotics line, which lets the wearer build an extensive range of customised, programmable limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|title=The Lego prosthetic arm that children can create and hack themselves|first=Oliver|last=Wainwright|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723183344/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/22/lego-prosthetic-arm-that-kids-can-hack-themselves|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|title=IKO Creative Prosthetic System|work=[[Core77]]|accessdate=23 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723184938/http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/29865/IKO-Creative-Prosthetic-System|archivedate=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Clones of Lego ==\n{{Main|Lego clone}}\nThe definitive shape of the Lego bricks, with the inner tubes, was patented by the Lego Group in 1958.<ref name=\"Time50Years\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Austen|first1=Ian|title=Building a Legal Case, Block by Block|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|accessdate=9 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 January 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122304/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02lego.html|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Several competitors have attempted to take advantage of Lego's popularity by producing blocks of similar dimensions, and advertising them as being compatible with Lego bricks.
