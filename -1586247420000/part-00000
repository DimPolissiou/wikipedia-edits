According to Christian Pelras (1985), Dato' Tallu converted King of Gowa and Tallo to Islam and changed their name to Sultan Muhammad.\n\nThe spread of Islam was initially driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago. Traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were usually the first to convert to Islam. Dominant kingdoms included [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] in [[Central Java]], and the sultanates of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the [[Maluku Islands]] to the east. By the end of the 13th century, Islam had been established in North Sumatra; by the 14th in northeast [[Malaya Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Brunei]], the southern [[Philippines]] and among some courtiers of [[East Java]]; and the 15th in [[Malacca]] and other areas of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Although it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow.\n\nDespite being one of the most significant developments in [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]], historical evidence is fragmentary and generally uninformative such that understandings of the coming of Islam to Indonesia are limited; there is considerable debate amongst scholars about what conclusions can be drawn about the conversion of Indonesian peoples.<ref name=RICKLEFS/>{{rp|3}} The primary evidence, at least of the earlier stages of the process, are gravestones and a few travellers' accounts, but these can only show that indigenous Muslims were in a certain place at a certain time. This evidence cannot explain more complicated matters such as how lifestyles were affected by the new religion or how deeply it affected societies. It cannot [[Cuius regio, eius religio|be assumed]], for example, that because a ruler was known to be a Muslim, that the process of Islamisation of that area was complete; rather the process was, and remains to this day, continuous in Indonesia. Nevertheless, a clear turning point occurred when the [[Hindu]] empire [[Majapahit]] in Java fell to the Islamised [[Demak Sultanate]]. In 1527, the Muslim ruler renamed newly conquered [[Sunda Kelapa]] as Jayakarta (meaning \"precious victory\") which was eventually contracted to [[Jakarta]].  [[cultural assimilation|Assimilation]] increased rapidly in the wake of this conquest.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Image:Pasai.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]] map]]\n<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|3}} Both Indonesia's colonial and republican governments have favoured Hindu and Buddhist sites in Java in their allocation of resources for excavation and preservation, with less emphasis on the early history of Islam in Indonesia.

Ricklefs (1991) identifies two overlapping processes by which the Islamisation of Indonesia occurred: (1) Indonesians came into contact with Islam and converted, and (2) foreign Muslim Asians (Indians, Chinese, Arabs, etc.) settled in Indonesia and mixed with local communities. Islam is thought to have been present in Southeast Asia from early in the Islamic era. From the time of the third caliph of Islam, '[[Uthman]]' (644-656), Muslim emissaries and merchants were arriving in China who must have passed through Indonesia sea routes from the Islamic world. It would have been through this contact that Arabic emissaries between 904 and the mid-12th century are thought to have become involved in the [[Sumatra]]n trading state of [[Srivijaya]].\n\nThe earliest accounts of the Indonesian archipelago date from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. According to those early accounts, the Indonesian archipelago was famous among early Muslim sailors, mainly due to its abundance of precious [[spice trade]] commodities such as [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[galangal]] and many other spices.<ref>http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/spice_geo.html#asia_southeast</ref><ref>[[Ibn Khordadbeh]]</ref>\n\nThe presence of foreign Muslims in Indonesia does not, however, demonstrate a significant level of local conversion or the establishment of local Islamic states.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\">{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year=1991  | location =London | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6}}</ref>{{rp|3}} The most reliable evidence of the early spread of Islam in Indonesia comes from inscriptions on tombstones and a limited number of travellers\u2019 accounts. The earliest legibly inscribed tombstone is dated AH 475 (AD 1082), although as it belongs to a non-Indonesian Muslim, there is doubt as to whether it was transported to Java at a later time.

The presence of the [[Shafi'i]] school of thought, which was to later dominate Indonesia, was reported by [[Ibn Battuta]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] traveller, in 1346. In his travel log, Ibn Battuta wrote that the ruler of Samudera Pasai was a [[Muslim]] who performs his religious duties with utmost zeal.

Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 400 feet in length (Columbus's Santa Maria, for comparison, was 85 feet). These carried hundreds of sailors on four tiers of decks. As a favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whose usurpation he assisted, he rose to the top of the imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing (the capital was later moved to Beijing by the Yongle Emperor). These voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qichao's Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng He in 1904. A [[Galle Trilingual Inscription|trilingual stele]] left by the navigator was discovered on the island of Sri Lanka shortly thereafter.\n\n==By region==\nIt was initially believed that Islam penetrated Indonesian society in a largely peaceful way, and from the 14th century to the end of the 19th century the archipelago saw almost no organised Muslim missionary activity.<ref>Nieuwenhuijze (1958), p. 35.</ref> Later findings of scholars say that some parts of Java, i.e. [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] West Java and the kingdom of [[Majapahit]] on East Java was conquered by Javanese Muslims.

Dating from the 14th century, tombstones in [[Brunei]], [[Terengganu]] (northeast [[Malaysia]]) and [[East Java]] are evidence of Islam's spread. The Trengganu stone has a predominance of [[Sanskrit]] over Arabic words, suggesting the representation of the introduction of Islamic law. According to the ''Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433)'' a written account by [[Zheng He]]'s chronicler and translator [[Ma Huan]]: \"the main states of the northern part of [[Sumatra]] were already [[Islam]]ic [[Sultanate]]s. In 1414, he visited the [[Malacca Sultanate]], its ruler [[Parameswara (king)|Iskandar Shah]] was [[Muslim]] and also his people, and they were very strict believers\".\n\nIn Kampong Pande, the tombstone of Sultan [[Firman Syah]], the grandson of Sultan [[Johan Syah]], has an inscription stating that Banda Aceh was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Aceh Darussalam]] and that it was built on Friday, 1 Ramadhan (22 April 1205) by Sultan Johan Syah after he defeated the Hindu and Buddhist Kingdom of [[Indra Purba]] whose capital was [[Bandar Lamuri]].\nThe establishment of further Islamic states in North Sumatra is documented by late 15th- and 16th-century graves including those of the first and second Sultans of Pedir; [[Muzaffar Syah]], buried (1497) and [[Ma\u2019ruf Syah]], buried (1511). [[Aceh]] was founded in the early 16th century and would later become the most powerful North Sumatran state and one of the most powerful in the whole Malay archipelago. The Aceh Empire's first sultan was [[Ali Mughayat Syah]] whose tombstone is dated (1530).\n\nThe book of Portuguese apothecary [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] that documents his observations of Java and Sumatra from his 1512 to 1515 visits, is considered one of the most important sources on the spread of Islam in Indonesia. In 1520, Ali Mughayat Syah started military campaigns to dominate the northern part of Sumatra. He conquered Daya, and submitted the people to Islam.<ref>http://www.kitlv.nl/pdf_documents/asia.acehnese.pdf</ref> Further conquests extended down the east coast, like [[Pidie Regency|Pidie]] and [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]] incorporating several pepper-producing and gold-producing regions. The addition of such regions ultimately led to internal tensions within the Sultanate, as Aceh's strength was as a trading port, whose economic interests vary from those of producing ports.\n\nAt this time, according to Pires, most Sumatran kings were Muslim; from Aceh and south along the east coast to [[Palembang]] the rulers were Muslim, while south of Palembang and around the southern tip of Sumatra and up the west coast, most were not. In other Sumatran kingdoms, such as [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]] and [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] the rulers were Muslim although at that stage their subjects and peoples of neighbouring areas were not, however, it was reported that the religion was continually gaining new adherents.\n\nAfter the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonials and the tensions that followed regarding control of the [[spice trade]], the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] Sultan [[Alauddin al-Kahar]] (1539\u201371) sent an embassy to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1564, requesting Ottoman support against the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The Ottomans then dispatched their admiral [[Kurto\u011flu H\u0131z\u0131r Reis]] he set sail with a force of 22 [[Xebec|ships]] carrying soldiers, military equipment and other supplies. According to accounts written by the Portuguese Admiral [[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]], the Ottoman fleet that first arrived in [[Aceh]] consisted of a few [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and largely of [[Muslim]]s from the ports of the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePSkf-DHu5YC&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false | title= Islam in the Indonesian world: an account of institutional formation |first= Azyumardi |last= Azra |page=169 |publisher=Mizan Pustaka |year= 2006}}</ref>\n\n===East Sumatra and Malay peninsula===\nFounded around the beginning of the 15th century by [[Parameswara (king)|Sultan Parameswara]], the great Malay trading state [[Malacca Sultanate|The Sultanate of Malacca]] founded by [[Parameswara (king)|Sultan Parameswara]], was, as the most important trading centre of the Southeast Asian archipelago, a centre of foreign Muslims, and it thus appears a supporter of the spread of Islam. [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], himself is known to have converted to [[Islam]], and taken the name Iskandar Shah after [[Treasure voyages|the arrival]] of the [[Hui people|Hui-Chinese]] Admiral [[Zheng He]]. From Malacca and elsewhere, gravestones survive showing not only its spread in the Malay archipelago but as the religion of a number of cultures and their rulers in the late 15th century.\n\n===Central and eastern Java===\n[[File:Masjid demak.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grand Mosque of [[Sultanate of Demak|Demak]], the first Muslim state in Java]]\n\nInscriptions in [[Old Javanese]] rather than Arabic on a significant series of gravestones dating back to 1369 in East Java, indicate that these are almost certainly [[Javanese people|Javanese]], rather than foreign Muslims. Due to their elaborate decorations and proximity to the site of the former Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit capital, Damais concludes that these are the graves of very distinguished Javanese, perhaps even royalty.<ref>Damais, Louis-Charles, '\u00c9tudes javanaises, I: Les tombes musulmanes dat\u00e9es de Tr\u00e5l\u00e5j\u00e5.' ''BEFEO'', vol. 54 (1968), pp. 567-604.</ref>  This suggests that some of the Javanese elite adopted Islam at a time when the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit was at the height of its glory.\n\nRicklefs (1991) argues that these east Javan gravestones, sited and dated at the non-coastal [[Majapahit]], cast doubt on the long-held view that Islam in Java originated on the coast and represented political and religious opposition to the kingdom. As a kingdom with far-reaching political and trading contacts, Majapahit would have almost certainly been in contact with Muslim traders, however there is conjecture over the likelihood of its sophisticated courtiers being attracted to a religion of merchants. Rather, mystical [[Sufi]] Muslim teachers, possibly claiming supernatural powers (''[[keramat]]''), are thought to be a more probable agent of religious conversion of Javanese court elites, who had long been familiar with aspects of Hindu and Buddhist mysticism.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|5}}\n\nCentral and East Java, the areas where the ethnic Javanese lived, was still claimed by the Hindu-Buddhist king living in the interior of east java at [[Kediri Kingdom|Daha]]. The coastal areas such as [[Surabaya]] were, however, Islamised and were often at war with the interior, except for Tuban, which remained loyal to the Hindu-Buddhist king. Some of the coastal Muslim lords were converted Javanese, or Muslim Chinese, Indians, Arabs, and Malays who had settled and established their trading state on the coast. This war between the Muslim-coast and Hindu-Buddhist interior also continued long after the fall of the Majapahit by the [[Demak Sultanate]], and the animosity also continues long after both regions had adopted Islam.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nWhen the peoples of the north coast of Java adopted Islam is unclear. Chinese Muslim, [[Ma Huan]] and envoy of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of China,<ref name=\"RAW\"/> visited the Java coast in 1416 and reported in his book, ''Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433)'', that there were only three types of people in Java: Muslims from the west, Chinese (some Muslim) and the heathen Javanese.<ref>Ma Huan\u2019s, ''Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433).'' Ed. and transl. J.V.G. Mills. Cambridge: University Press, 1970</ref> Since the east Javan gravestones were those of Javanese Muslims fifty years before, Ma Huan's report indicates that Islam may have indeed been adopted by Javanese courtiers before the coastal Javanese.\n\nAn early Muslim gravestone dated AH 822 (AD 1419) has been found at [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]] an East Javanese port and marks the burial of [[Malik Ibrahim]].<ref name=Coedes>{{Cite book\n  | last =   C\u0153d\u00e8s\n  | first = George\n  | authorlink = Georges Coed\u00e8s\n  | title = The Indianized states of Southeast Asia\n  | publisher = University of Hawaii Press\n  | year = 1968\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC\n  | isbn =9780824803681 }}</ref>{{rp|241}}  As it appears, however, that he was non-Javanese foreigner, the gravestone does not provide evidence of coastal Javanese conversion. Malik Ibrahim was, however, according to Javanese tradition one of the first nine apostles of Islam in Java (the ''[[Wali Sanga]]'') although no documentary evidence exists for this tradition. In the late 15th century, the powerful [[Majapahit]] empire in Java was at its decline. After had been defeated in several battles, the last [[Hindu]] kingdom in Java fell under the rising power of Islamised Kingdom of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] in 1520.\n\n===The Da'wah of Walisongo===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\nThe question is: why only in the period of 40\u201350 years, [[Islam]] can be received so widespread in Java, whereas before it was very difficult to develop? One significant key-factor of the success of [[Da'wah]] of Walisongo is how the Walisongo develop an abandoned civilization of [[Majapahit]] into a new civilization whose roots form the [[Majapahit]] but with [[Islamic]] characteristics. For example, until the early [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] era, society is divided into two major groups, such as [[Majapahit]] era. First, the Group of Gusti, namely people who live in the palace. Secondly, the Group of Kawula, people who live outside the palace.\n\nGusti means master, Kawula means slaves or servants, who only have the right to lease, not the right of ownership, because the right of ownership is only belongs to the people with the social status of (Gusti). In the era of [[Majapahit]], all property is owned by the palace (state, or nation, or the kingdom). And if the king wants to give a deserving subject, then by the King's order that person will be given sima land or perdikan land (fief). This also means, if he had been a Kawula, his social status will rise, and he will become a Gusti, and he also has the right of ownership as he was given the simah land (fief).\n\nWalisongo, especially Sheikh Siti Jenar and [[Sunan Kalijaga]], created a new perspective in the cultural and society structure. From the cultural and society structure of \"gusti and kawula\", they introduce the new community structure which is so-called \"Masyarakat\", derived from the Arabic term of [[Musharaka]], which means the community of equal and mutual cooperation. It is proven by the absence of the term of \"masyarakat\", \"rakyat\", and so on in the Javanese Kawi vocabulary. It's a new term that was brought by Walisongo during their Dha'wah.\n\nOne of the methods that were used by the Walisongo is by changing the mindset of the society. People with social status of Gusti pronoun themselves as: intahulun, kulun or ingsun. While the people with social status of Kawula pronoun themselves as: kula or kawula ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]), abdi ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]), saya or sahaya ([[Sumatran]]): hamba or ambo ([[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]]). Walisongo changes all those self pronunciation or designation which indicates the meaning of slaves, and replaced it with the term of ingsun, aku, kulun, or awak, and other designations that do not represent the identity of slaves or persons with lower social status. That is the concept of society of Walisongo, society or community of equal and mutual cooperation, which does not possess any discriminations nor discriminate the terms of self designation between subject classes such \"gusti and kawula\", which is called \"Masyarakat\". In present days, the term of kula, ambo, abdi, hamba, sahaya or saya, are still being used for the purpose of showing respect toward others, for example: while speaking toward someone older, parents, strangers, and so on.\n\nAt the time of [[Majapahit]], in addition to class gusti, people do not have property rights, such as houses, cattle, and so on, because all of them belonged to the palace. If the palace had intent, like wanting to build a bridge or temple and require the sacrifice, the children of class subjects taken and victimized. By changing the structure of society, class subjects can finally rejected because of the equality of the new society system.\n\nThe [[Javanese people|Javanese]] in the era of [[Majapahit]] are known to be very arrogant. Their principle of life is \"Adigang Adigung Adiguna\" (superior in power, authority, and knowledge). They are very proud to have been able to subdue and or humiliate others. According to the testimony of [[Antonio Pigafetta]], at that time, there's no one is as arrogant exceed the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. If they were walking, and there's also people from another nation who walk at a higher place, they will be ordered to get down. and if they refuse, they will be killed. That is the character of the Javanese. So in old Javanese Kawi, there's no term of \"kalah\" (\"lose\"). If someone at odds with others, then there is only \"win\" or \"dead\". As [[Ma Huan]] noted, in Chao-wa ([[Java]]) if a man touches their head with his hand, or if there is a misunderstanding about money at a sale, or a battle of words when they are crazy with drunkenness, they at once pull out their knives and stab [each other]. He who is stronger prevails. When [one] man is stabbed to death, if the [other] man runs away and conceals himself for three days before emerging, then he does not forfeit his life; [but] if he is seized at the very moment [of the stabbing], he too is instantly stabbed to death. The country has no [such] punishment as flogging; no [matter whether] the offence be great or small, they tie both [the offender's] hands behind his back with a fine rattan, and hustle him away for several paces, then they take a pu-la-t\u2019ou and stab the offender once or twice in the small of the back or in the floating ribs, causing instant death. According to the local custom of the country no day [passes] without a man being put to death; [it is] very terrible.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/qing/huan_ying-yai_sheng-lan%5B1%5D.pdf|title= Ma Huan's Ying-Yai Sheng-Lan : \u2018The Overall Survey of The Oceans Shores\u2019 [I433] |author=Feng Ch\u2019eng-Ch\u00fcn, J.

It is not derived from the word of \"kalah\" such as in bahasa Indonesia. But it comes from the Javanese prefix \"Ng\" which means toward (a purpose, and or destination), for example: ng-alas (toward the forest), ng-awang (toward the clouds), and Ng-Allah means toward Allah (tawakkal), the word \"ngalah\" itself was then used by the Javanese as an expression in avoiding conflict. The other evidence of the arrogance of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] is represented during the time when envoys from [[China]] (Meng Xi) came in order to deliver a message from their king ([[Kubilai Khan]]) to the king of [[Singasari]] ([[Kertanegara]]). The messages ordered Kertanegara to submit toward their kingdom. And in return, Meng Xi (the Chinese envoy) was wounded, humiliated, and sent back to [[China]] by [[Kertanegara]] (it is said that his ear was cut off instantly by Kertanegara himself). The term of Carok in [[Madura]] is also derived from the ancient Javanese Tradition. Carok in Javanese Kawi means fighting; Warok means a fighter; and [[Ken Arok]] means the leader of fighters. Therefore, Walisongo introduced a new term such as \"sabar\" (patient), \"adil\" (fair), 'tawadhu', including \"ngalah\" or ngAllah (avoiding conflict).{{cn|reason=the derivation of ngalah from ngAllah is highly dubious; rather looks like folk etymology|date=April 2019}}\n\nWalisongo sees that [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] actually were only embraced by the Gusti society inside the palaces{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}. The common religion that generally embraced by the general population outside the palace is Kapitayan, a religion whose devotee toward Sang Hyang Taya. Taya means \"suwung\" (empty). God of Kapitayan is abstract, it can not be described. Sang Hyang Taya is defined simply as \"tan keno kinaya ngapa\", it can not be seen, thought, nor imagined. And the might of Sang Hyang Taya whose then represent in various places, such as in stone, monument, trees, and in many other places in this world. Therefore, they makes their offerings over those place, not because they worshiping the stones, trees, monuments, or anything else, but they did it as their devotion toward Sang Hyang Taya whose his might is represent in all over those places. An exactly similar concept of [[Brahman]] is found in Hinduism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/brahman/|title=What Is Brahman, Omnipresent Consciousness? Definition of the Sanskrit Word|last=Borohhov|first=Dmitri|website=Ananda|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nThis Kapitayan religion, is the ancient religion, in which is studied in the archaeological study, whose its archeological remains and legacy in Western terminology is known as dormant, [[menhirs]], [[sarcophagus]], and many others in which indicates that there is an ancient religion around that place. And by the Dutch historian, this religion is referred to as [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], because it worships trees, rocks, and spirits. Meanwhile, according to [[Ma Huan]], such practices are called as nonbeliever.\n\nThese Kapitayan's religious values was then adopted by the Walisongo in spreading [[Islam]] toward the regions. Because the concept of tawhid in Kapitayan is basically same with the concept of [[tawhid]] in [[Islam]]: the term of \"Tan keno kinaya ngapa\" in Kapitayan (\"can't be seen, can't be thought, can't be imagined, He is beyond everything\"), have the same equal meaning as \"laisa kamitslihi syai'un\" in Islam (\"There is nothing like unto Him\"; Qur'an Surah Ash-Syura chapter 42 verse 11).\n\nWalisongo also use the term \"Sembahyang\" (worshipping Sang Hyang Taya in Kapitayan) in introducing the term of \"Shalat\" in Islam. In term of places for worship or praying, Walisongo also using the term Sanggar in Kapitayan, which represents a four-square building with an empty hole on its wall as the symbol of Sang Hyang Taya in Kapitayan, not arca or statues as in [[Hindu]] or [[Buddhism]]. This term of place for praying or worshipping in Kapitayan also used by Walisongo by the name \"Langgar\" represents the term of [[Masjid]] in [[Islam]]\" {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThere's also a ritual in form of not eating from morning up until night in Kapitayan, which is called as Upawasa (Puasa or Poso). Incidentally, the ritual of fasting in Hinduism is also called \"Upawasa\" or \"Upavasa\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Upavasa|title=Upavasa - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Instead of using the term of [[fasting]] or [[Siyam]] in Islam, Walisongo used the term of Puasa or Upawasa from the Kapitayan in describing the ritual. The term of Poso Dino Pitu in Kapitayan whose means fasting on the day of the second and the fifth day in which is equal to seven days of fasting, is very similar with the form of fasting on Mondays and Thursdays in Islam. The Tradition of \"Tumpengan\" of Kapitayan was also being kept by the Walisongo under the Islamic perspective as known as \"Sedekah\". This is the meaning of the terminology in which [[Gus Dur]] (Indonesian fourth president) mentioned as \"mempribumikan Islam\" (Indigenize Islam).<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RqE3klimOSwC\n| title = Pendidikan Islam transformatif\n| last = Arif\n| first = Mahmud\n| date = 2008-01-01\n| publisher = PT LKiS Pelangi Aksara\n| isbn = 9789791283403\n| language = id\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zELOtquVn64C\n| title = Dari Harvard hingga Makkah\n| last = Azra\n| first = Azyumardi\n| date = 2005-01-01\n| publisher = Penerbit Republika\n| isbn = 9789793210520\n| language = id\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of [[Majapahit]], there is a ceremony which is called as \"[[\u015ar\u0101ddha|Sraddha]]\", a ceremony that being held 12 years after a person's death. There is a time in the Majapahit history, during the Sraddha ceremony a King of Majapahit (Bhre Pamotan Sang Sinagara), a poet namely Mpu Tanakung, composed the \"Kidung of [[Benawa|Banawa]] Sekar\" (The Ballad of Flowers Boat), to describe how the ceremony was carried out with full opulence and grandeur.

This is a tradition in which derived from Campa, not a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] tradition, nor the [[Hindu]] tradition. Because these traditions also exist in parts of [[Central Asia]], such as [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. In the books of Tradition of [[Champa]], such tradition has already exist since a very long time ago.\n\nIn the history of [[Majapahit]]'s superstition, there are only [[Yaksha|Yaksa]], [[Pisacas]], Wiwil, [[Rakshasha]], Gandharwa, [[Bhoot (ghost)|Bhuta]], Khinnara, Widyadhara, Ilu-Ilu, Dewayoni, [[Banaspati]], and ancestral spirits, in which known by the people of Majapahit. The people of Majapahit was very rational. They all were sailors and get to know people from all across the globe such as [[Japan]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Africa]], [[Arabia]], [[Pacific Ocean]] and many other place. In the [[Islamic]] era that detracted from [[Champa]] a lot of new superstition appears, such as [[pocong]]. This is clearly derived from the Muslim faith, because in Majapahit the dead was burned and not covered with sheet. There are also many other superstition like [[kuntilanak]], [[tuyul]], including the legend of Nyai Roro Kidul or Queen of the Southern Sea who came later.\n\nDuring the Dha'wah of Walisongo, Islam was spread without any force of arms, not even a single drip of blood was spilled. Only after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] period, especially after the [[Diponegoro War]], the Dutch really run out of funds, they even owe millions of Goldens because of it. And even after Prince [[Diponegoro]] arrested, his remains were never subject. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] finally deconstructing the stories about Walisongo, as in Babad Kediri. From this Babad Kediri, it was then emerged the book chronicle of Darmo Gandul and Suluk Gatholoco. the one who authored the book is named Ngabdullah, a person from [[Pati Regency|Pati]] [[East Java]], who because of poverty, making it lapsed and leaves Islam. He later renamed by the name of Ki Tunggul Wulung and settled in [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]].\n\nIn the essay fiber, there are many stories{{Weasel inline|date=November 2019}} that contrary to historical fact, such as [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] attacked [[Majapahit]] 1478 and the emergence of a fictional character Sabdo Palon Naya Genggong who swore that 500 years after the attack, [[Majapahit]] will bounce back. Yet according to the more authentic script and more ancient, in that year that attacked Majapahit is King Girindrawardhana, the Hindu king of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. And because of the very strong influence of that tale, it makes President [[Soeharto]], the second president of Indonesia was very confident so that he sets pass of Aliran Kepercayaan (Beliefs) in [[Indonesia]] in the year 1978 (500 years after 1478), as a symbol of truth of the oath of Sabdo Palon about the resurrection of [[Majapahit]].\n\nSecretly, it turns out the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] make history essay of themselves to confuse the struggle of [[Muslims]], especially the followers of [[Prince Diponegoro]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] even made [[Babad Tanah Jawi]] of their own version, which is different from the original [[Babad Tanah Jawi]]. For example, the text of the [[Kidung Sunda]], described the event of Bubad War, it is said that Gajah Mada kill the King of Sunda and his entire family. This is what makes the people of Sunda harbored a grudge against the people of Java. Tracking back from its historical record, the text itself was only appeared in Bali in 1860, made by the order of the Dutch. Sunda is a great kingdom, if such an event was truly ever happened, it must have been written by the [[Kingdom of Sunda]]. The Kingdom of Sunda was very detail in describing its historical records. Even the Traditions of Sunda was written in very detail in the manuscript of \"Sanghyang Siksa Kanda ng Karesyan\". How come such great event was never mentioned even once in the Chronicle of Sunda (Babad Sunda). The event itself was never mentioned in the Chronicles of [[Majapahit]], nor in any other historical records. Again, this is the tactic of the Dutch in dividing the society by creating a false history as part of the Dutch policy \"Divide and Conquer\". From all of the distortion of history, all must have originated from a script written by the Dutch post-[[Diponegoro War]].\n\nIn metallurgical technology smelting iron and steel, for example, people of Majapahit had already possess the ability of creating the [[Majapahit]]'s heritage, such as [[keris]], [[spears]], [[arrow]]s, even barunastra, a giant tipped steel arrows that functioned like an underwater torpedo, in which when it was fired, it have the ability to penetrate and bilge the ship. [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] kingdom as the descendants of Majapahit has the ability to create a large caliber of cannons in which exported to [[Malacca]], [[Pasai]], even [[Japan]]. The fact that Japanese bought guns from [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] sourced from the record of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], during the conquered of the Port of Malacca, the Portuguese intelligences sourced that the Malacca fortress was complemented by large-size of cannons imported from [[Java]]. When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] was just newly arrived from [[Europe]], their ships were uprooted by cannon fires when approaching the port of [[Malacca]]. The proof of this can be seen in Fort Surosowan [[Banten]], where in front of it there is a giant cannon named \"Ki Amok\". As an illustration of the magnitude of the cannon, people can get into the cannon holes. Even the imperial seal of the Kingdom of Demak still clearly attached on the cannon, which is made in [[Jepara]], a region in the Kingdom of Demak whose famous by its craftsmanship. The term of \"bedil besar\" (\"big guns\") and \"jurumudi ning bedil besar\" (\"the driver of the big guns\") describes \"cannon\" and \"cannon operators\". That was the military technology during the era of Walisongo.\n\n{{Citation needed span|text=Even in the dressing civilization, it was in the era of Walisongo appear kemben (strapless garments), surjan, and so on.

Walisongo also changed the story of [[Mahabharata]] his in which is different from the original version of [[India]]. In the Indian version, Five [[Pandavas]] have one wife, [[Draupadi]]. This means that the concept of polyandry. Walisongo change this concept by telling that [[Draupadi]] was the wife of [[Yudhishthira]], the eldest brother. Werkudara or [[Bima]] has a wife namely Arimbi, who later he married again with Dewi Nagagini who have children Ontorejo and Ontoseno, and so on. Illustrated that all the [[Pandavas]] were polygamy. Whereas the original version, [[Draupadi]] polyandry with five [[Pandavas]]. Similarly, in the story of [[Ramayana]]. [[Hanuman]] has two fathers, namely King Kesari Maliawan and God Bayu. By Walisongo, [[Hanuman]] referred to as the son of God Bayu. Walisongo even make the pedigree that the gods were descendants of [[Adam]]. This can be seen on the Pakem Pewayangan (the grip of puppet show) Ringgit Purwa at Pustaka Raja Purwa in [[Surakarta|Solo]], which is a grip for every puppet masters in [[Java]].<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yTmkiXVnskUC\n| title = Javanese Literature in Surakarta Manuscripts: Introduction and manuscripts of the Karaton Surakarta\n| last = Florida\n| first = Nancy K.\n| date = 1993-01-01\n| publisher = SEAP Publications\n| isbn = 9780877276036\n| language = en\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c2w6AAAAMAAJ\n| title = Serat pakem ringgit purwa tjaking pakeliran: lampahan Palasara\n|author= Najawirangka (Mas Ngabei.)\n| date = 1966-01-01\n| publisher = Mahabarata\n| language = jv\n}}</ref> So the grip that was used by the puppeteers in Java was the Pakem derived from Walisongo, not [[India]]. This puppet spectacle, not only as an entertainment but also functioned as guidance in the propagation of [[Islam]] by Walisongo.\n\nIn context of literary, the kingdom of [[Majapahit]] had already created [[Kakawin]] and [[Kidung]]. By Walisongo, this literary richness was then enriched by the making of variety of song compositions, such as \"Tembang Gedhe\" (great song composition), \"Tembang Tengahan\" (mid song composition),  and \"Tembang Alit\" (short song composition).  [[Macapat]] flourished in coastal areas. [[Kakawin]] and [[Kidung]] could only be understood by a poet. But for the [[Tembang]], even an illiterate people can understand.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Muljono\n| first = Untung\n| date = March 1, 2012\n| title = PENDIDIKAN NILAI LUHUR MELALUI TEMBANG (LAGU) DOLANAN ANAK\n| url = http://journal.isi.ac.id/index.php/selonding/article/download/67/27\n| journal = Jurnal Online ISI Yogyakarta\n| doi = \n| pmid = \n| access-date = February 24, 2016\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.dream.co.id/lifestyle/tembang-cara-lembut-sunan-giri-menyiarkan-islam-150330v.html\n| title = Walisongo (3): Tembang, Cara Lembut Sunan Giri Siarkan Islam {{!}} Dream.co.id\n| website = Dream.co.id\n| access-date = 2016-02-25\n}}</ref> This is the method of Walisongo Propagation through the arts and culture.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.nu.or.id/a,public-m,dinamic-s,detail-ids,2-id,39122-lang,id-c,daerah-t,Tembang+Karya+Walisongo+akan+Ditampilkan+dalam+Resepsi+HUT+RI-.phpx\n| title = Tembang Karya Walisongo akan Ditampilkan dalam Resepsi HUT RI\n| date = \n| website = NU Online\n| publisher = Nahdlatul Ulama Online\n| access-date = February 24, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of the Dha'wah of Walisongo is [[Slametan]] which is developed by [[Sunan Bonang]] and then followed by the other Sunans. In the [[Tantrayana]] ([[Tantra|Tantric]]) religion embraced by kings of Nusantara archipelago, there's a sect in that Tantric religion which is called the Bhairawa Tantra sect that worships the Goddess of Earth, [[Goddess Durga]], [[Goddess Kali]], and others Gods. They have a rituals where they were creating a circle called Ksetra. The largest Ksetra in [[Majapahit]] is Ksetralaya, the place today is called Troloyo.\n\nThe ritual ceremony itself was known as Upacara [[Panchamakara]] (the ceremony of five ma, the [[Panchamakara|malima]]), namely Mamsya (meat), [[Matsya]] (fish), Madya (wine), [[Maithuna]] (sexual intercourse), and [[Mudra]] (meditation). Men and women formed a circle and all naked. In the center is provided meat, fish, and wine. After eating and drinking, they have sexual intercourse (maituna). After satisfying various desires, they meditated. For higher levels, they were using human flesh for Mamsya replacing meat, Sura fish (shark) for Matsa, and human blood for Madya replacing wine.\n\nAt Indonesian National Museum in [[Jakarta]], there is a statue of a character named [[Adityawarman]] height of three meters and stands on a pile of skulls. He is the priest of the Bhairawa Tantra, the one who performed the teaching of malima. He was inaugurated and then became the Bhairawa priest carrying the title of Wisesa Dharani, the ruler of the earth. The statue described that he sat on a pile of hundreds of corpses, drinking blood, and laughing uproariously.\n\nWitnessing such situation, [[Sunan Bonang]] created a similar event. He entered the center of Bhairawa Tantra in [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. As formerly the center of the Bhairawa Tantra, no wonder if the slogan of the City of Kediri now is Canda Bhirawa. During his Dha'wah in Kediri, [[Sunan Bonang]] stayed in the west of the river, in the village of Singkal [[Nganjuk]]. There he held a similar ceremony, made the similar circle, but all of the participants were all males, in the center of the circle there is the food, and then they pray together. This is called the Kenduri Tradition (festivity tradition) or [[Slametan]]. Developed from village to village to match the ceremony of malima ([[Panchamakara]]). Therefore, [[Sunan Bonang]] was also known as Sunan Wadat Cakrawati, as the leader or imam of Chakra Iswara (Cakreswara).\n\nTherefore, in the rural areas, people can be considered as a Muslim if he's already stated the Islamic creed, circumcised, and [[Slametan]]. So malima was originally not Maling (thievery), Maen (gambling), Madon (adultery), Madat (consuming opium), and Mendem (drunk), but the five elements of [[Panchamakara]]. Islam was then growing even faster because the people do not want their children get victimized as in Bhairawa Tantra. Then, they prefer to join [[Slametan]] with the aim of \"slamet\" (safety). This is the way of Walisongo spreads [[Islam]] without violence.\n\nIn conclusion, about 800 years Islam entered the archipelago, since the year 674 until Walisongo era in 1470, but has yet to be accepted by society en masse. It was then after the era of Walisongo, Islam developed so widespread in the archipelago. And until now, the teaching Walisongo is still run by the majority of [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]] Muslims.\n\n===Western Java===\n[[Tom\u00e9 Pires|Pires]]' ''Suma Oriental'' reports that [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]-speaking [[West Java]] was not Muslim in his day, and was indeed hostile to Islam.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/> A Muslim conquest of the area occurred later in the 16th century. In the early 16th century, the Central and East Java (home of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]) were still claimed by the Hindu-Buddhist king living in the interior of East Java at Daha ([[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]]). The north coast was, however, Muslim as far as Surabaya and were often at war with the interior. Of these coastal Muslim lords, some were Javanese who had adopted Islam, and others were not originally Javanese but Muslim traders settling along established trading routes including Chinese, [[India]]ns, [[Arabs]] and [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]. According to Piers, these settlers and their descendants so admired Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture that they emulate its style and were thus themselves becoming Javanese.\n\nIn his study of the [[Banten Sultanate]], Martin van Bruinessen focuses on the link between mystics and royalty, contrasting that Islamisation process with the one which prevailed elsewhere in Java:\n\"In the case of Banten, the indigenous sources associate the [[Tariqa|tarekats]] not with trade and traders but with kings, magical power and political legitimation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Shari`a court, tarekat and pesantren: religious institutions in the sultanate of Banten|author=Martin van Bruinessen|journal=Archipel|volume=50|pages=165\u2013200|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Banten_religious_institutions.htm|year=1995|doi=10.3406/arch.1995.3069|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026142322/http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/Banten_religious_institutions.htm|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He presents evidence that [[Sunan Gunungjati]] was initiated into the [[Najmuddin Kubra|Kubra]], [[Shattari]], and [[Naqshbandi]] orders of [[sufism]].\n\n===Other areas===\nThere is no evidence of the adoption of Islam by Indonesians before the 16th century in areas outside of Java, Sumatra, the sultanates of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and Brunei and the Malay Peninsula.\n\n==Indonesian and Malay legends==\nAlthough time frames for the establishment of Islam in Indonesian regions can be broadly determined, the historical primary sources cannot answer many specific questions, and considerable controversy surrounds the topic. Such sources do not explain why significant conversions of Indonesians to Islam did not begin until after several centuries of foreign Muslims visiting and living in Indonesia, nor do they adequately explain the origin and development of Indonesia's idiosyncratic strains of Islam, or how Islam came to be the dominant religion in Indonesia.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|8}} To fill these gaps, many scholars turn to Malay and Indonesian legends surrounding Indonesian conversion to Islam. Ricklefs argues that although they are not reliable historical accounts of actual events, they are valuable in illuminating some of the events is through their shared insights into the nature of learning and magical powers, foreign origins and trade connections of the early teachers, and the conversion process that moved from the elite downwards. These also provide insight into how later generations of Indonesians view Islamisation.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|8\u201311}} These sources include:\n* ''[[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai]]'' (\"The Story of the kings of Pasai\") \u2013 an [[History of the Malay language#Old Malay (7th to 14th century)|Old Malay]] text that tells how Islam came to \"Samudra\" ([[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], northern Sumatra) where the first Indonesian Islamic state was founded.\n* ''[[Malay Annals|Sejarah Melayu]]'' (\"Malay History\") \u2013 an Old Malay text, which like ''Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai'' tells the story of the conversion of Samudra, but also tells of the conversion of the King of Malacca.\n* ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'' (\"History of the land of Java\") \u2013 a generic name for a large number of manuscripts, in which the first [[Javanese language|Javanese]] conversions are attributed to the ''[[Wali Sanga]]'' (\"nine saints\").\n* ''[[Sejarah Banten]]'' (\"History of [[Banten]]\") \u2013 A Javanese text containing stories of conversion.\nOf the texts mentioned here, the Malay texts describe the conversion process as a significant watershed, signified by formal and tangible signs of conversion such as circumcision, the [[Shahada|Confession of Faith]], and the adoption of an Arabic name. On the other hand, while magical events still play a prominent role in the Javanese accounts of Islamisation, such turning points of conversion as in the Malay texts are otherwise not as evident. This suggests a more adsorptive process for the Javanese,<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|9}} that is consistent with the significantly larger [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|syncretic]] element in contemporary Javanese Islam in comparison to the relatively orthodox Islam of Sumatra and [[Malaysia]].\n\n==Flags of the Sultanates in the East Indies==\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of the Sultanate of Banten.svg|Sultanate of Banten\nFile:Flag of Cirebon Sultanate.jpg|Cirebon Sultanate\nFile:Yogyakarta Sultanate Hamengkubhuwono X Emblem.svg|Yogyakarta Sultanate\nFile:Flag of the Sultanate of Mataram.svg|Sultanate of Mataram\nFile:Minangkabau royal seal.jpg|Minangkabau\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Familiewapen van de Sultan van Deli TMnr 6251-1.jpg|Deli\nFile:Flag of Aceh Sultanate.svg|Flag of Aceh Sultanate\nFile:Flag of the Sultanate of Gowa.svg|Flag of Gowa Sultanate\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Islam}}\n* [[Islam in Indonesia]]\n* [[History of Indonesia]]\n* [[List of mosques in Indonesia|Mosques in Indonesia]]\n* [[Spread of Islam in Southeast Asia]]\n* [[Spread of Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Van Nieuwenhuijze\n  | first = C.A.O.\n  | title = Aspects of Islam in Post-Colonial Indonesia\n  | location = The Hague\n  | publisher = W. van Hoeve Ltd.\n  | year = 1958\n  | isbn = }}\n{{Islam in Indonesia}}\n{{History of Islam|state=collapsed}}\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spread Of Islam In Indonesia}}\n[[Category:History of Islam in Indonesia| ]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:13th century in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Spread of Islam|Indonesia]]\n[[Category:13th-century Islam]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2017}}\n{{History of Indonesia}}\nThe history of arrival and '''spread of [[Islam]] in [[Indonesia]]''' is unclear.

According to Christian Pelras (1985), Dato' Tallu converted King of Gowa and Tallo to Islam and changed their name to Sultan Muhammad.\n\nThe spread of Islam was initially driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago. Traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were usually the first to convert to Islam. Dominant kingdoms included [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] in [[Central Java]], and the sultanates of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the [[Maluku Islands]] to the east. By the end of the 13th century, Islam had been established in North Sumatra; by the 14th in northeast [[Malaya Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Brunei]], the southern [[Philippines]] and among some courtiers of [[East Java]]; and the 15th in [[Malacca]] and other areas of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Although it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow.\n\nDespite being one of the most significant developments in [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]], historical evidence is fragmentary and generally uninformative such that understandings of the coming of Islam to Indonesia are limited; there is considerable debate amongst scholars about what conclusions can be drawn about the conversion of Indonesian peoples.<ref name=RICKLEFS/>{{rp|3}} The primary evidence, at least of the earlier stages of the process, are gravestones and a few travellers' accounts, but these can only show that indigenous Muslims were in a certain place at a certain time. This evidence cannot explain more complicated matters such as how lifestyles were affected by the new religion or how deeply it affected societies. It cannot [[Cuius regio, eius religio|be assumed]], for example, that because a ruler was known to be a Muslim, that the process of Islamisation of that area was complete; rather the process was, and remains to this day, continuous in Indonesia. Nevertheless, a clear turning point occurred when the [[Hindu]] empire [[Majapahit]] in Java fell to the Islamised [[Demak Sultanate]]. In 1527, the Muslim ruler renamed newly conquered [[Sunda Kelapa]] as Jayakarta (meaning \"precious victory\") which was eventually contracted to [[Jakarta]].  [[cultural assimilation|Assimilation]] increased rapidly in the wake of this conquest.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Image:Pasai.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]] map]]\n<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|3}} Both Indonesia's colonial and republican governments have favoured Hindu and Buddhist sites in Java in their allocation of resources for excavation and preservation, with less emphasis on the early history of Islam in Indonesia.

Ricklefs (1991) identifies two overlapping processes by which the Islamisation of Indonesia occurred: (1) Indonesians came into contact with Islam and converted, and (2) foreign Muslim Asians (Indians, Chinese, Arabs, etc.) settled in Indonesia and mixed with local communities. Islam is thought to have been present in Southeast Asia from early in the Islamic era. From the time of the third caliph of Islam, '[[Uthman]]' (644-656), Muslim emissaries and merchants were arriving in China who must have passed through Indonesia sea routes from the Islamic world. It would have been through this contact that Arabic emissaries between 904 and the mid-12th century are thought to have become involved in the [[Sumatra]]n trading state of [[Srivijaya]].\n\nThe earliest accounts of the Indonesian archipelago date from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. According to those early accounts, the Indonesian archipelago was famous among early Muslim sailors, mainly due to its abundance of precious [[spice trade]] commodities such as [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, [[galangal]] and many other spices.<ref>http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/spice_geo.html#asia_southeast</ref><ref>[[Ibn Khordadbeh]]</ref>\n\nThe presence of foreign Muslims in Indonesia does not, however, demonstrate a significant level of local conversion or the establishment of local Islamic states.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\">{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =A History of Modern Indonesia since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year=1991  | location =London | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-333-57689-6}}</ref>{{rp|3}} The most reliable evidence of the early spread of Islam in Indonesia comes from inscriptions on tombstones and a limited number of travellers\u2019 accounts.

Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 400 feet in length (Columbus's Santa Maria, for comparison, was 85 feet). These carried hundreds of sailors on four tiers of decks. As a favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whose usurpation he assisted, he rose to the top of the imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing (the capital was later moved to Beijing by the Yongle Emperor). These voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qichao's Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng He in 1904. A [[Galle Trilingual Inscription|trilingual stele]] left by the navigator was discovered on the island of Sri Lanka shortly thereafter.\n\n==By region==\nIt was initially believed that Islam penetrated Indonesian society in a largely peaceful way, and from the 14th century to the end of the 19th century the archipelago saw almost no organised Muslim missionary activity.<ref>Nieuwenhuijze (1958), p. 35.</ref> Later findings of scholars say that some parts of Java, i.e. [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] West Java and the kingdom of [[Majapahit]] on East Java was conquered by Javanese Muslims.

Dating from the 14th century, tombstones in [[Brunei]], [[Terengganu]] (northeast [[Malaysia]]) and [[East Java]] are evidence of Islam's spread. The Trengganu stone has a predominance of [[Sanskrit]] over Arabic words, suggesting the representation of the introduction of Islamic law. According to the ''Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433)'' a written account by [[Zheng He]]'s chronicler and translator [[Ma Huan]]: \"the main states of the northern part of [[Sumatra]] were already [[Islam]]ic [[Sultanate]]s. In 1414, he visited the [[Malacca Sultanate]], its ruler [[Parameswara (king)|Iskandar Shah]] was [[Muslim]] and also his people, and they were very strict believers\".\n\nIn Kampong Pande, the tombstone of Sultan [[Firman Syah]], the grandson of Sultan [[Johan Syah]], has an inscription stating that Banda Aceh was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Aceh Darussalam]] and that it was built on Friday, 1 Ramadhan (22 April 1205) by Sultan Johan Syah after he defeated the Hindu and Buddhist Kingdom of [[Indra Purba]] whose capital was [[Bandar Lamuri]].\nThe establishment of further Islamic states in North Sumatra is documented by late 15th- and 16th-century graves including those of the first and second Sultans of Pedir; [[Muzaffar Syah]], buried (1497) and [[Ma\u2019ruf Syah]], buried (1511). [[Aceh]] was founded in the early 16th century and would later become the most powerful North Sumatran state and one of the most powerful in the whole Malay archipelago. The Aceh Empire's first sultan was [[Ali Mughayat Syah]] whose tombstone is dated (1530).\n\nThe book of Portuguese apothecary [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] that documents his observations of Java and Sumatra from his 1512 to 1515 visits, is considered one of the most important sources on the spread of Islam in Indonesia. In 1520, Ali Mughayat Syah started military campaigns to dominate the northern part of Sumatra. He conquered Daya, and submitted the people to Islam.<ref>http://www.kitlv.nl/pdf_documents/asia.acehnese.pdf</ref> Further conquests extended down the east coast, like [[Pidie Regency|Pidie]] and [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]] incorporating several pepper-producing and gold-producing regions. The addition of such regions ultimately led to internal tensions within the Sultanate, as Aceh's strength was as a trading port, whose economic interests vary from those of producing ports.\n\nAt this time, according to Pires, most Sumatran kings were Muslim; from Aceh and south along the east coast to [[Palembang]] the rulers were Muslim, while south of Palembang and around the southern tip of Sumatra and up the west coast, most were not. In other Sumatran kingdoms, such as [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]] and [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] the rulers were Muslim although at that stage their subjects and peoples of neighbouring areas were not, however, it was reported that the religion was continually gaining new adherents.\n\nAfter the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonials and the tensions that followed regarding control of the [[spice trade]], the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] Sultan [[Alauddin al-Kahar]] (1539\u201371) sent an embassy to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1564, requesting Ottoman support against the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The Ottomans then dispatched their admiral [[Kurto\u011flu H\u0131z\u0131r Reis]] he set sail with a force of 22 [[Xebec|ships]] carrying soldiers, military equipment and other supplies. According to accounts written by the Portuguese Admiral [[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]], the Ottoman fleet that first arrived in [[Aceh]] consisted of a few [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and largely of [[Muslim]]s from the ports of the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePSkf-DHu5YC&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false | title= Islam in the Indonesian world: an account of institutional formation |first= Azyumardi |last= Azra |page=169 |publisher=Mizan Pustaka |year= 2006}}</ref>\n\n===East Sumatra and Malay peninsula===\nFounded around the beginning of the 15th century by [[Parameswara (king)|Sultan Parameswara]], the great Malay trading state [[Malacca Sultanate|The Sultanate of Malacca]] founded by [[Parameswara (king)|Sultan Parameswara]], was, as the most important trading centre of the Southeast Asian archipelago, a centre of foreign Muslims, and it thus appears a supporter of the spread of Islam. [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara]], himself is known to have converted to [[Islam]], and taken the name Iskandar Shah after [[Treasure voyages|the arrival]] of the [[Hui people|Hui-Chinese]] Admiral [[Zheng He]]. From Malacca and elsewhere, gravestones survive showing not only its spread in the Malay archipelago but as the religion of a number of cultures and their rulers in the late 15th century.\n\n===Central and eastern Java===\n[[File:Masjid demak.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grand Mosque of [[Sultanate of Demak|Demak]], the first Muslim state in Java]]\n\nInscriptions in [[Old Javanese]] rather than Arabic on a significant series of gravestones dating back to 1369 in East Java, indicate that these are almost certainly [[Javanese people|Javanese]], rather than foreign Muslims. Due to their elaborate decorations and proximity to the site of the former Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit capital, Damais concludes that these are the graves of very distinguished Javanese, perhaps even royalty.<ref>Damais, Louis-Charles, '\u00c9tudes javanaises, I: Les tombes musulmanes dat\u00e9es de Tr\u00e5l\u00e5j\u00e5.' ''BEFEO'', vol. 54 (1968), pp. 567-604.</ref>  This suggests that some of the Javanese elite adopted Islam at a time when the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit was at the height of its glory.\n\nRicklefs (1991) argues that these east Javan gravestones, sited and dated at the non-coastal [[Majapahit]], cast doubt on the long-held view that Islam in Java originated on the coast and represented political and religious opposition to the kingdom. As a kingdom with far-reaching political and trading contacts, Majapahit would have almost certainly been in contact with Muslim traders, however there is conjecture over the likelihood of its sophisticated courtiers being attracted to a religion of merchants. Rather, mystical [[Sufi]] Muslim teachers, possibly claiming supernatural powers (''[[keramat]]''), are thought to be a more probable agent of religious conversion of Javanese court elites, who had long been familiar with aspects of Hindu and Buddhist mysticism.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|5}}\n\nCentral and East Java, the areas where the ethnic Javanese lived, was still claimed by the Hindu-Buddhist king living in the interior of east java at [[Kediri Kingdom|Daha]]. The coastal areas such as [[Surabaya]] were, however, Islamised and were often at war with the interior, except for Tuban, which remained loyal to the Hindu-Buddhist king. Some of the coastal Muslim lords were converted Javanese, or Muslim Chinese, Indians, Arabs, and Malays who had settled and established their trading state on the coast. This war between the Muslim-coast and Hindu-Buddhist interior also continued long after the fall of the Majapahit by the [[Demak Sultanate]], and the animosity also continues long after both regions had adopted Islam.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nWhen the peoples of the north coast of Java adopted Islam is unclear. Chinese Muslim, [[Ma Huan]] and envoy of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of China,<ref name=\"RAW\"/> visited the Java coast in 1416 and reported in his book, ''Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433)'', that there were only three types of people in Java: Muslims from the west, Chinese (some Muslim) and the heathen Javanese.<ref>Ma Huan\u2019s, ''Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433).'' Ed. and transl. J.V.G. Mills. Cambridge: University Press, 1970</ref> Since the east Javan gravestones were those of Javanese Muslims fifty years before, Ma Huan's report indicates that Islam may have indeed been adopted by Javanese courtiers before the coastal Javanese.\n\nAn early Muslim gravestone dated AH 822 (AD 1419) has been found at [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]] an East Javanese port and marks the burial of [[Malik Ibrahim]].<ref name=Coedes>{{Cite book\n  | last =   C\u0153d\u00e8s\n  | first = George\n  | authorlink = Georges Coed\u00e8s\n  | title = The Indianized states of Southeast Asia\n  | publisher = University of Hawaii Press\n  | year = 1968\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC\n  | isbn =9780824803681 }}</ref>{{rp|241}}  As it appears, however, that he was non-Javanese foreigner, the gravestone does not provide evidence of coastal Javanese conversion. Malik Ibrahim was, however, according to Javanese tradition one of the first nine apostles of Islam in Java (the ''[[Wali Sanga]]'') although no documentary evidence exists for this tradition. In the late 15th century, the powerful [[Majapahit]] empire in Java was at its decline. After had been defeated in several battles, the last [[Hindu]] kingdom in Java fell under the rising power of Islamised Kingdom of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] in 1520.\n\n===The Da'wah of Walisongo===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\nThe question is: why only in the period of 40\u201350 years, [[Islam]] can be received so widespread in Java, whereas before it was very difficult to develop? One significant key-factor of the success of [[Da'wah]] of Walisongo is how the Walisongo develop an abandoned civilization of [[Majapahit]] into a new civilization whose roots form the [[Majapahit]] but with [[Islamic]] characteristics. For example, until the early [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] era, society is divided into two major groups, such as [[Majapahit]] era. First, the Group of Gusti, namely people who live in the palace. Secondly, the Group of Kawula, people who live outside the palace.\n\nGusti means master, Kawula means slaves or servants, who only have the right to lease, not the right of ownership, because the right of ownership is only belongs to the people with the social status of (Gusti). In the era of [[Majapahit]], all property is owned by the palace (state, or nation, or the kingdom). And if the king wants to give a deserving subject, then by the King's order that person will be given sima land or perdikan land (fief). This also means, if he had been a Kawula, his social status will rise, and he will become a Gusti, and he also has the right of ownership as he was given the simah land (fief).\n\nWalisongo, especially Sheikh Siti Jenar and [[Sunan Kalijaga]], created a new perspective in the cultural and society structure. From the cultural and society structure of \"gusti and kawula\", they introduce the new community structure which is so-called \"Masyarakat\", derived from the Arabic term of [[Musharaka]], which means the community of equal and mutual cooperation. It is proven by the absence of the term of \"masyarakat\", \"rakyat\", and so on in the Javanese Kawi vocabulary. It's a new term that was brought by Walisongo during their Dha'wah.\n\nOne of the methods that were used by the Walisongo is by changing the mindset of the society. People with social status of Gusti pronoun themselves as: intahulun, kulun or ingsun. While the people with social status of Kawula pronoun themselves as: kula or kawula ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]), abdi ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]), saya or sahaya ([[Sumatran]]): hamba or ambo ([[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]]). Walisongo changes all those self pronunciation or designation which indicates the meaning of slaves, and replaced it with the term of ingsun, aku, kulun, or awak, and other designations that do not represent the identity of slaves or persons with lower social status. That is the concept of society of Walisongo, society or community of equal and mutual cooperation, which does not possess any discriminations nor discriminate the terms of self designation between subject classes such \"gusti and kawula\", which is called \"Masyarakat\". In present days, the term of kula, ambo, abdi, hamba, sahaya or saya, are still being used for the purpose of showing respect toward others, for example: while speaking toward someone older, parents, strangers, and so on.\n\nAt the time of [[Majapahit]], in addition to class gusti, people do not have property rights, such as houses, cattle, and so on, because all of them belonged to the palace. If the palace had intent, like wanting to build a bridge or temple and require the sacrifice, the children of class subjects taken and victimized. By changing the structure of society, class subjects can finally rejected because of the equality of the new society system.\n\nThe [[Javanese people|Javanese]] in the era of [[Majapahit]] are known to be very arrogant. Their principle of life is \"Adigang Adigung Adiguna\" (superior in power, authority, and knowledge). They are very proud to have been able to subdue and or humiliate others. According to the testimony of [[Antonio Pigafetta]], at that time, there's no one is as arrogant exceed the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. If they were walking, and there's also people from another nation who walk at a higher place, they will be ordered to get down. and if they refuse, they will be killed. That is the character of the Javanese. So in old Javanese Kawi, there's no term of \"kalah\" (\"lose\"). If someone at odds with others, then there is only \"win\" or \"dead\". As [[Ma Huan]] noted, in Chao-wa ([[Java]]) if a man touches their head with his hand, or if there is a misunderstanding about money at a sale, or a battle of words when they are crazy with drunkenness, they at once pull out their knives and stab [each other]. He who is stronger prevails. When [one] man is stabbed to death, if the [other] man runs away and conceals himself for three days before emerging, then he does not forfeit his life; [but] if he is seized at the very moment [of the stabbing], he too is instantly stabbed to death. The country has no [such] punishment as flogging; no [matter whether] the offence be great or small, they tie both [the offender's] hands behind his back with a fine rattan, and hustle him away for several paces, then they take a pu-la-t\u2019ou and stab the offender once or twice in the small of the back or in the floating ribs, causing instant death. According to the local custom of the country no day [passes] without a man being put to death; [it is] very terrible.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/qing/huan_ying-yai_sheng-lan%5B1%5D.pdf|title= Ma Huan's Ying-Yai Sheng-Lan : \u2018The Overall Survey of The Oceans Shores\u2019 [I433] |author=Feng Ch\u2019eng-Ch\u00fcn, J.

It is not derived from the word of \"kalah\" such as in bahasa Indonesia. But it comes from the Javanese prefix \"Ng\" which means toward (a purpose, and or destination), for example: ng-alas (toward the forest), ng-awang (toward the clouds), and Ng-Allah means toward Allah (tawakkal), the word \"ngalah\" itself was then used by the Javanese as an expression in avoiding conflict. The other evidence of the arrogance of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] is represented during the time when envoys from [[China]] (Meng Xi) came in order to deliver a message from their king ([[Kubilai Khan]]) to the king of [[Singasari]] ([[Kertanegara]]). The messages ordered Kertanegara to submit toward their kingdom. And in return, Meng Xi (the Chinese envoy) was wounded, humiliated, and sent back to [[China]] by [[Kertanegara]] (it is said that his ear was cut off instantly by Kertanegara himself). The term of Carok in [[Madura]] is also derived from the ancient Javanese Tradition. Carok in Javanese Kawi means fighting; Warok means a fighter; and [[Ken Arok]] means the leader of fighters. Therefore, Walisongo introduced a new term such as \"sabar\" (patient), \"adil\" (fair), 'tawadhu', including \"ngalah\" or ngAllah (avoiding conflict).{{cn|reason=the derivation of ngalah from ngAllah is highly dubious; rather looks like folk etymology|date=April 2019}}\n\nWalisongo sees that [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] actually were only embraced by the Gusti society inside the palaces{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}. The common religion that generally embraced by the general population outside the palace is Kapitayan, a religion whose devotee toward Sang Hyang Taya. Taya means \"suwung\" (empty). God of Kapitayan is abstract, it can not be described. Sang Hyang Taya is defined simply as \"tan keno kinaya ngapa\", it can not be seen, thought, nor imagined. And the might of Sang Hyang Taya whose then represent in various places, such as in stone, monument, trees, and in many other places in this world. Therefore, they makes their offerings over those place, not because they worshiping the stones, trees, monuments, or anything else, but they did it as their devotion toward Sang Hyang Taya whose his might is represent in all over those places. An exactly similar concept of [[Brahman]] is found in Hinduism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ananda.org/yogapedia/brahman/|title=What Is Brahman, Omnipresent Consciousness? Definition of the Sanskrit Word|last=Borohhov|first=Dmitri|website=Ananda|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref>\n\nThis Kapitayan religion, is the ancient religion, in which is studied in the archaeological study, whose its archeological remains and legacy in Western terminology is known as dormant, [[menhirs]], [[sarcophagus]], and many others in which indicates that there is an ancient religion around that place. And by the Dutch historian, this religion is referred to as [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], because it worships trees, rocks, and spirits. Meanwhile, according to [[Ma Huan]], such practices are called as nonbeliever.\n\nThese Kapitayan's religious values was then adopted by the Walisongo in spreading [[Islam]] toward the regions. Because the concept of tawhid in Kapitayan is basically same with the concept of [[tawhid]] in [[Islam]]: the term of \"Tan keno kinaya ngapa\" in Kapitayan (\"can't be seen, can't be thought, can't be imagined, He is beyond everything\"), have the same equal meaning as \"laisa kamitslihi syai'un\" in Islam (\"There is nothing like unto Him\"; Qur'an Surah Ash-Syura chapter 42 verse 11).\n\nWalisongo also use the term \"Sembahyang\" (worshipping Sang Hyang Taya in Kapitayan) in introducing the term of \"Shalat\" in Islam. In term of places for worship or praying, Walisongo also using the term Sanggar in Kapitayan, which represents a four-square building with an empty hole on its wall as the symbol of Sang Hyang Taya in Kapitayan, not arca or statues as in [[Hindu]] or [[Buddhism]]. This term of place for praying or worshipping in Kapitayan also used by Walisongo by the name \"Langgar\" represents the term of [[Masjid]] in [[Islam]]\" {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThere's also a ritual in form of not eating from morning up until night in Kapitayan, which is called as Upawasa (Puasa or Poso). Incidentally, the ritual of fasting in Hinduism is also called \"Upawasa\" or \"Upavasa\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Upavasa|title=Upavasa - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Instead of using the term of [[fasting]] or [[Siyam]] in Islam, Walisongo used the term of Puasa or Upawasa from the Kapitayan in describing the ritual. The term of Poso Dino Pitu in Kapitayan whose means fasting on the day of the second and the fifth day in which is equal to seven days of fasting, is very similar with the form of fasting on Mondays and Thursdays in Islam. The Tradition of \"Tumpengan\" of Kapitayan was also being kept by the Walisongo under the Islamic perspective as known as \"Sedekah\". This is the meaning of the terminology in which [[Gus Dur]] (Indonesian fourth president) mentioned as \"mempribumikan Islam\" (Indigenize Islam).<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RqE3klimOSwC\n| title = Pendidikan Islam transformatif\n| last = Arif\n| first = Mahmud\n| date = 2008-01-01\n| publisher = PT LKiS Pelangi Aksara\n| isbn = 9789791283403\n| language = id\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zELOtquVn64C\n| title = Dari Harvard hingga Makkah\n| last = Azra\n| first = Azyumardi\n| date = 2005-01-01\n| publisher = Penerbit Republika\n| isbn = 9789793210520\n| language = id\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of [[Majapahit]], there is a ceremony which is called as \"[[\u015ar\u0101ddha|Sraddha]]\", a ceremony that being held 12 years after a person's death. There is a time in the Majapahit history, during the Sraddha ceremony a King of Majapahit (Bhre Pamotan Sang Sinagara), a poet namely Mpu Tanakung, composed the \"Kidung of [[Benawa|Banawa]] Sekar\" (The Ballad of Flowers Boat), to describe how the ceremony was carried out with full opulence and grandeur. This tradition was then called by society around the lakes and beach with the term Sadran or Nyadran (derived from the word [[\u015ar\u0101ddha|Sraddha]]).<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Lon7gmj040MC\n| title = Southeast Asia in the 9th to 14th Centuries\n| last = Marr\n| first = David G.\n| last2 = Milner\n| first2 = Anthony Crothers\n| date = 1986-01-01\n| publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies\n| isbn = 9789971988395\n| language = en\n}}</ref> Walisongo who derived from [[Champa]] also brought religious traditions, such as ceremonies of 3 days, 7 days, 40 days, 10 days, and 1000 days after someone's death. This is a tradition in which derived from Campa, not a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] tradition, nor the [[Hindu]] tradition. Because these traditions also exist in parts of [[Central Asia]], such as [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. In the books of Tradition of [[Champa]], such tradition has already exist since a very long time ago.\n\nIn the history of [[Majapahit]]'s superstition, there are only [[Yaksha|Yaksa]], [[Pisacas]], Wiwil, [[Rakshasha]], Gandharwa, [[Bhoot (ghost)|Bhuta]], Khinnara, Widyadhara, Ilu-Ilu, Dewayoni, [[Banaspati]], and ancestral spirits, in which known by the people of Majapahit. The people of Majapahit was very rational. They all were sailors and get to know people from all across the globe such as [[Japan]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Africa]], [[Arabia]], [[Pacific Ocean]] and many other place. In the [[Islamic]] era that detracted from [[Champa]] a lot of new superstition appears, such as [[pocong]]. This is clearly derived from the Muslim faith, because in Majapahit the dead was burned and not covered with sheet. There are also many other superstition like [[kuntilanak]], [[tuyul]], including the legend of Nyai Roro Kidul or Queen of the Southern Sea who came later.\n\nDuring the Dha'wah of Walisongo, Islam was spread without any force of arms, not even a single drip of blood was spilled. Only after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] period, especially after the [[Diponegoro War]], the Dutch really run out of funds, they even owe millions of Goldens because of it. And even after Prince [[Diponegoro]] arrested, his remains were never subject. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] finally deconstructing the stories about Walisongo, as in Babad Kediri. From this Babad Kediri, it was then emerged the book chronicle of Darmo Gandul and Suluk Gatholoco. the one who authored the book is named Ngabdullah, a person from [[Pati Regency|Pati]] [[East Java]], who because of poverty, making it lapsed and leaves Islam. He later renamed by the name of Ki Tunggul Wulung and settled in [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]].\n\nIn the essay fiber, there are many stories{{Weasel inline|date=November 2019}} that contrary to historical fact, such as [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] attacked [[Majapahit]] 1478 and the emergence of a fictional character Sabdo Palon Naya Genggong who swore that 500 years after the attack, [[Majapahit]] will bounce back. Yet according to the more authentic script and more ancient, in that year that attacked Majapahit is King Girindrawardhana, the Hindu king of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. And because of the very strong influence of that tale, it makes President [[Soeharto]], the second president of Indonesia was very confident so that he sets pass of Aliran Kepercayaan (Beliefs) in [[Indonesia]] in the year 1978 (500 years after 1478), as a symbol of truth of the oath of Sabdo Palon about the resurrection of [[Majapahit]].\n\nSecretly, it turns out the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] make history essay of themselves to confuse the struggle of [[Muslims]], especially the followers of [[Prince Diponegoro]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] even made [[Babad Tanah Jawi]] of their own version, which is different from the original [[Babad Tanah Jawi]]. For example, the text of the [[Kidung Sunda]], described the event of Bubad War, it is said that Gajah Mada kill the King of Sunda and his entire family. This is what makes the people of Sunda harbored a grudge against the people of Java. Tracking back from its historical record, the text itself was only appeared in Bali in 1860, made by the order of the Dutch. Sunda is a great kingdom, if such an event was truly ever happened, it must have been written by the [[Kingdom of Sunda]]. The Kingdom of Sunda was very detail in describing its historical records. Even the Traditions of Sunda was written in very detail in the manuscript of \"Sanghyang Siksa Kanda ng Karesyan\". How come such great event was never mentioned even once in the Chronicle of Sunda (Babad Sunda). The event itself was never mentioned in the Chronicles of [[Majapahit]], nor in any other historical records. Again, this is the tactic of the Dutch in dividing the society by creating a false history as part of the Dutch policy \"Divide and Conquer\". From all of the distortion of history, all must have originated from a script written by the Dutch post-[[Diponegoro War]].\n\nIn metallurgical technology smelting iron and steel, for example, people of Majapahit had already possess the ability of creating the [[Majapahit]]'s heritage, such as [[keris]], [[spears]], [[arrow]]s, even barunastra, a giant tipped steel arrows that functioned like an underwater torpedo, in which when it was fired, it have the ability to penetrate and bilge the ship. [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] kingdom as the descendants of Majapahit has the ability to create a large caliber of cannons in which exported to [[Malacca]], [[Pasai]], even [[Japan]]. The fact that Japanese bought guns from [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] sourced from the record of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], during the conquered of the Port of Malacca, the Portuguese intelligences sourced that the Malacca fortress was complemented by large-size of cannons imported from [[Java]]. When the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] was just newly arrived from [[Europe]], their ships were uprooted by cannon fires when approaching the port of [[Malacca]]. The proof of this can be seen in Fort Surosowan [[Banten]], where in front of it there is a giant cannon named \"Ki Amok\". As an illustration of the magnitude of the cannon, people can get into the cannon holes. Even the imperial seal of the Kingdom of Demak still clearly attached on the cannon, which is made in [[Jepara]], a region in the Kingdom of Demak whose famous by its craftsmanship. The term of \"bedil besar\" (\"big guns\") and \"jurumudi ning bedil besar\" (\"the driver of the big guns\") describes \"cannon\" and \"cannon operators\". That was the military technology during the era of Walisongo.\n\n{{Citation needed span|text=Even in the dressing civilization, it was in the era of Walisongo appear kemben (strapless garments), surjan, and so on. Whereas in the era of Majapahit, people are not completely dressed, as this is can be seen in the reliefs of every ancient temples across Nusantara, where men and women are topless.|date=November 2019|reason=}}\n\n[[Majapahit]] famous puppet show is \"[[Wayang Beber]]\", whereas during the Walisongo era is \"[[Wayang Kulit]]\". Walisongo also changed the story of [[Mahabharata]] his in which is different from the original version of [[India]]. In the Indian version, Five [[Pandavas]] have one wife, [[Draupadi]]. This means that the concept of polyandry. Walisongo change this concept by telling that [[Draupadi]] was the wife of [[Yudhishthira]], the eldest brother. Werkudara or [[Bima]] has a wife namely Arimbi, who later he married again with Dewi Nagagini who have children Ontorejo and Ontoseno, and so on. Illustrated that all the [[Pandavas]] were polygamy. Whereas the original version, [[Draupadi]] polyandry with five [[Pandavas]]. Similarly, in the story of [[Ramayana]]. [[Hanuman]] has two fathers, namely King Kesari Maliawan and God Bayu. By Walisongo, [[Hanuman]] referred to as the son of God Bayu. Walisongo even make the pedigree that the gods were descendants of [[Adam]]. This can be seen on the Pakem Pewayangan (the grip of puppet show) Ringgit Purwa at Pustaka Raja Purwa in [[Surakarta|Solo]], which is a grip for every puppet masters in [[Java]].<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yTmkiXVnskUC\n| title = Javanese Literature in Surakarta Manuscripts: Introduction and manuscripts of the Karaton Surakarta\n| last = Florida\n| first = Nancy K.\n| date = 1993-01-01\n| publisher = SEAP Publications\n| isbn = 9780877276036\n| language = en\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c2w6AAAAMAAJ\n| title = Serat pakem ringgit purwa tjaking pakeliran: lampahan Palasara\n|author= Najawirangka (Mas Ngabei.)\n| date = 1966-01-01\n| publisher = Mahabarata\n| language = jv\n}}</ref> So the grip that was used by the puppeteers in Java was the Pakem derived from Walisongo, not [[India]]. This puppet spectacle, not only as an entertainment but also functioned as guidance in the propagation of [[Islam]] by Walisongo.\n\nIn context of literary, the kingdom of [[Majapahit]] had already created [[Kakawin]] and [[Kidung]]. By Walisongo, this literary richness was then enriched by the making of variety of song compositions, such as \"Tembang Gedhe\" (great song composition), \"Tembang Tengahan\" (mid song composition),  and \"Tembang Alit\" (short song composition).  [[Macapat]] flourished in coastal areas. [[Kakawin]] and [[Kidung]] could only be understood by a poet. But for the [[Tembang]], even an illiterate people can understand.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Muljono\n| first = Untung\n| date = March 1, 2012\n| title = PENDIDIKAN NILAI LUHUR MELALUI TEMBANG (LAGU) DOLANAN ANAK\n| url = http://journal.isi.ac.id/index.php/selonding/article/download/67/27\n| journal = Jurnal Online ISI Yogyakarta\n| doi = \n| pmid = \n| access-date = February 24, 2016\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.dream.co.id/lifestyle/tembang-cara-lembut-sunan-giri-menyiarkan-islam-150330v.html\n| title = Walisongo (3): Tembang, Cara Lembut Sunan Giri Siarkan Islam {{!}} Dream.co.id\n| website = Dream.co.id\n| access-date = 2016-02-25\n}}</ref> This is the method of Walisongo Propagation through the arts and culture.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.nu.or.id/a,public-m,dinamic-s,detail-ids,2-id,39122-lang,id-c,daerah-t,Tembang+Karya+Walisongo+akan+Ditampilkan+dalam+Resepsi+HUT+RI-.phpx\n| title = Tembang Karya Walisongo akan Ditampilkan dalam Resepsi HUT RI\n| date = \n| website = NU Online\n| publisher = Nahdlatul Ulama Online\n| access-date = February 24, 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of the Dha'wah of Walisongo is [[Slametan]] which is developed by [[Sunan Bonang]] and then followed by the other Sunans. In the [[Tantrayana]] ([[Tantra|Tantric]]) religion embraced by kings of Nusantara archipelago, there's a sect in that Tantric religion which is called the Bhairawa Tantra sect that worships the Goddess of Earth, [[Goddess Durga]], [[Goddess Kali]], and others Gods. They have a rituals where they were creating a circle called Ksetra. The largest Ksetra in [[Majapahit]] is Ksetralaya, the place today is called Troloyo.\n\nThe ritual ceremony itself was known as Upacara [[Panchamakara]] (the ceremony of five ma, the [[Panchamakara|malima]]), namely Mamsya (meat), [[Matsya]] (fish), Madya (wine), [[Maithuna]] (sexual intercourse), and [[Mudra]] (meditation). Men and women formed a circle and all naked. In the center is provided meat, fish, and wine. After eating and drinking, they have sexual intercourse (maituna). After satisfying various desires, they meditated. For higher levels, they were using human flesh for Mamsya replacing meat, Sura fish (shark) for Matsa, and human blood for Madya replacing wine.\n\nAt Indonesian National Museum in [[Jakarta]], there is a statue of a character named [[Adityawarman]] height of three meters and stands on a pile of skulls. He is the priest of the Bhairawa Tantra, the one who performed the teaching of malima. He was inaugurated and then became the Bhairawa priest carrying the title of Wisesa Dharani, the ruler of the earth. The statue described that he sat on a pile of hundreds of corpses, drinking blood, and laughing uproariously.\n\nWitnessing such situation, [[Sunan Bonang]] created a similar event. He entered the center of Bhairawa Tantra in [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. As formerly the center of the Bhairawa Tantra, no wonder if the slogan of the City of Kediri now is Canda Bhirawa. During his Dha'wah in Kediri, [[Sunan Bonang]] stayed in the west of the river, in the village of Singkal [[Nganjuk]]. There he held a similar ceremony, made the similar circle, but all of the participants were all males, in the center of the circle there is the food, and then they pray together. This is called the Kenduri Tradition (festivity tradition) or [[Slametan]]. Developed from village to village to match the ceremony of malima ([[Panchamakara]]). Therefore, [[Sunan Bonang]] was also known as Sunan Wadat Cakrawati, as the leader or imam of Chakra Iswara (Cakreswara).\n\nTherefore, in the rural areas, people can be considered as a Muslim if he's already stated the Islamic creed, circumcised, and [[Slametan]]. So malima was originally not Maling (thievery), Maen (gambling), Madon (adultery), Madat (consuming opium), and Mendem (drunk), but the five elements of [[Panchamakara]]. Islam was then growing even faster because the people do not want their children get victimized as in Bhairawa Tantra. Then, they prefer to join [[Slametan]] with the aim of \"slamet\" (safety). This is the way of Walisongo spreads [[Islam]] without violence.\n\nIn conclusion, about 800 years Islam entered the archipelago, since the year 674 until Walisongo era in 1470, but has yet to be accepted by society en masse. It was then after the era of Walisongo, Islam developed so widespread in the archipelago. And until now, the teaching Walisongo is still run by the majority of [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]] Muslims.\n\n===Western Java===\n[[Tom\u00e9 Pires|Pires]]' ''Suma Oriental'' reports that [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]-speaking [[West Java]] was not Muslim in his day, and was indeed hostile to Islam.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/> A Muslim conquest of the area occurred later in the 16th century. In the early 16th century, the Central and East Java (home of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]) were still claimed by the Hindu-Buddhist king living in the interior of East Java at Daha ([[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]]). The north coast was, however, Muslim as far as Surabaya and were often at war with the interior. Of these coastal Muslim lords, some were Javanese who had adopted Islam, and others were not originally Javanese but Muslim traders settling along established trading routes including Chinese, [[India]]ns, [[Arabs]] and [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]. According to Piers, these settlers and their descendants so admired Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture that they emulate its style and were thus themselves becoming Javanese.\n\nIn his study of the [[Banten Sultanate]], Martin van Bruinessen focuses on the link between mystics and royalty, contrasting that Islamisation process with the one which prevailed elsewhere in Java:\n\"In the case of Banten, the indigenous sources associate the [[Tariqa|tarekats]] not with trade and traders but with kings, magical power and political legitimation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Shari`a court, tarekat and pesantren: religious institutions in the sultanate of Banten|author=Martin van Bruinessen|journal=Archipel|volume=50|pages=165\u2013200|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Banten_religious_institutions.htm|year=1995|doi=10.3406/arch.1995.3069|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026142322/http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/Banten_religious_institutions.htm|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He presents evidence that [[Sunan Gunungjati]] was initiated into the [[Najmuddin Kubra|Kubra]], [[Shattari]], and [[Naqshbandi]] orders of [[sufism]].\n\n===Other areas===\nThere is no evidence of the adoption of Islam by Indonesians before the 16th century in areas outside of Java, Sumatra, the sultanates of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and Brunei and the Malay Peninsula.\n\n==Indonesian and Malay legends==\nAlthough time frames for the establishment of Islam in Indonesian regions can be broadly determined, the historical primary sources cannot answer many specific questions, and considerable controversy surrounds the topic. Such sources do not explain why significant conversions of Indonesians to Islam did not begin until after several centuries of foreign Muslims visiting and living in Indonesia, nor do they adequately explain the origin and development of Indonesia's idiosyncratic strains of Islam, or how Islam came to be the dominant religion in Indonesia.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|8}} To fill these gaps, many scholars turn to Malay and Indonesian legends surrounding Indonesian conversion to Islam. Ricklefs argues that although they are not reliable historical accounts of actual events, they are valuable in illuminating some of the events is through their shared insights into the nature of learning and magical powers, foreign origins and trade connections of the early teachers, and the conversion process that moved from the elite downwards. These also provide insight into how later generations of Indonesians view Islamisation.<ref name=\"RICKLEFS\"/>{{rp|8\u201311}} These sources include:\n* ''[[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai]]'' (\"The Story of the kings of Pasai\") \u2013 an [[History of the Malay language#Old Malay (7th to 14th century)|Old Malay]] text that tells how Islam came to \"Samudra\" ([[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], northern Sumatra) where the first Indonesian Islamic state was founded.\n* ''[[Malay Annals|Sejarah Melayu]]'' (\"Malay History\") \u2013 an Old Malay text, which like ''Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai'' tells the story of the conversion of Samudra, but also tells of the conversion of the King of Malacca.\n* ''[[Babad Tanah Jawi]]'' (\"History of the land of Java\") \u2013 a generic name for a large number of manuscripts, in which the first [[Javanese language|Javanese]] conversions are attributed to the ''[[Wali Sanga]]'' (\"nine saints\").\n* ''[[Sejarah Banten]]'' (\"History of [[Banten]]\") \u2013 A Javanese text containing stories of conversion.\nOf the texts mentioned here, the Malay texts describe the conversion process as a significant watershed, signified by formal and tangible signs of conversion such as circumcision, the [[Shahada|Confession of Faith]], and the adoption of an Arabic name. On the other hand, while magical events still play a prominent role in the Javanese accounts of Islamisation, such turning points of conversion as in the Malay texts are otherwise not as evident.

This means that the country has a population density of {{convert|521|/km2|abbr=on}}. The density of 500 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> was reached in the first half of 2014.\n\n[[Bangladesh]] is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density#density of the most populous countries|only country]] (if not counting the small [[city state]]s) larger in total area than and with a higher population density than the Netherlands. There are 11 more countries with a higher population density, but they all have a smaller population (hence a smaller total area).\n\nAs a result of these demographic characteristics the Netherlands has had to plan its [[land management|land use]] strictly. Since 1946 the [[VROM|Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] has been occupied with the national coordination of land use. Because of its high population density the Netherlands has also [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land from the sea]] by [[polder]]ing. Between 1927 and 1968 an entire province, [[Flevoland]] was created. It currently (2015) houses more than 400,000 people. Because of these policies, the Dutch have been able to combine high levels of population density with extremely high levels of [[agriculture|agricultural production]].\n\nEven though the Netherlands is so densely populated, it has no municipalities with a population over one million, although the two largest municipalities of the country do score well over a million if the complete city region is counted, including the neighbouring satellite towns that often are physically connected to the main municipality. Moreover, the \"four big cities\" ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) can in many ways be regarded as a single metropolitan area, the [[Randstad]] (\"rim city\" or \"edge city\") with over 7.5 million inhabitants around an agricultural \"green heart\" (''het [[Groene Hart]]).\n\n{{Largest cities of the Netherlands}}\n\n==Births and deaths==\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em;

Furthermore, [[life expectancy]] has increased because of developments in [[medicine]], and in addition to this, the Netherlands has seen increasing immigration. Despite these developments combined with the [[population boom]] after the [[Second World War]], the low birth rate has caused extremely low population growth: 2005 saw the lowest absolute population growth since 1900.\n\nThis demographic development has consequences for [[health care]] and [[social security]] policy. As the Dutch population ages, the proportion of people of working age, as a percentage of the entire population, decreases. Important policy advisors like the [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|CBS]] (Statistical Office) and the [[Centraal Planbureau|CPB]] (Planning Office) have pointed out that this will cause problems with the current system of old age pensions: fewer people will work to pay for old age pensions, while there will be more people receiving those pensions. Furthermore, the costs of health care are also projected to increase. These developments have caused several cabinets, most notably the recent [[Second cabinet Balkenende|second Balkenende cabinet]] to reform the system of health care and social security to increase participation in the labour market and make people more conscious of the money they spend on health care.\n\nIn 2003, the annual birth rate per thousand was highest in the province of Flevoland (15.9). The overall lifelong [[Total fertility rate]] (TFR), was highest in the province of Flevoland (2.0) and lowest in the province of Limburg (1.6). The municipality with the highest TFR was Urk (3.23) followed by Valkenburg (2.83), Graafstroom (2.79) and Staphorst (2.76). The lowest TFRs were recorded in Vaals (1.11) and Thorn (1.21).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2003/2003-1269-wm.htm|title=Largest families in Urk|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe total population at December 31, 2006 was 16,356,914.

While during the economic boom of the 1990s their unemployment and dependence on welfare had strongly decreased, the economic downturn between 2001 and 2004 disproportionally affected immigrant groups. This would be explained by their functioning as a labour reserve, by their lower educational levels and by lower language skills. The report also noted that per capita [[social interaction]]s between native Dutch and immigrant populations tended to decline over time, partly explainable by the size growth of immigrant groups. Integration levels strongly varied between groups. Surinamese and Antilleans were well economically integrated, but the latter less so culturally. Cultural integration was limited for Turks, but better for Moroccans. Of the asylum seekers, Somalis were among the least integrated into Dutch society, while Iranians were the best integrated with the highest education levels and modern lifestyles. Though the educational levels of the second generation were a significant improvement over those of the first generation, they still lagged behind the native Dutch who themselves on average had been attending ever higher school types. While half of all native Dutch pupils in 2005 proceeded to higher secondary education (HAVO and VWO), for Turks and Moroccans the share was a fifth and for Somali pupils even lower.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2007, non-Western groups were generally socio-economically disadvantaged and of the four largest non-Western groups, Turks and Moroccans were the most disadvantaged. In 2006 38.7% of Moroccans and 43.9% of Turks aged 15\u201364 were in employment, their unemployment rate was about four times the level of the native Dutch (17.2% for Moroccans and 15.1% for Turks), and 30% received some type of [[Welfare|social welfare]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter 2008, the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|financial crisis]] and the [[eurocrisis]] again hit immigrant groups particularly hard.

In the 1950s 560,000{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} people migrated to the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], leaving their war-torn and overpopulated home country behind. At least 60,000 of these migrants were [[Indo people|Indo-European]] (mixed Dutch-Indonesian) repatriants that moved on, mostly to the United States, after being repatriated to the Netherlands from the former [[Dutch East Indies]] during and after the Indonesian revolution.\n\nIn 2005 some 121,000 people migrated from the Netherlands. There is considerable migration towards neighbouring states, [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and to the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. Furthermore, almost half of the current emigration consists of people returning to their country of birth, including rejected [[asylum seekers]], after the more stringent migration laws were implemented.\n\n==Demographic statistics==\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2019.<ref name=\"WPR 2018\">{{cite|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/netherlands-population/|title=Netherlands Population 2019|website=World Population Review}}</ref>\n\n*One birth every 3 minutes\t\n*One death every 4 minutes\t\n*One net migrant every 31 minutes\t\n*Net gain of one person every 11 minutes\n\n[[File:Animated population pyramid of the Netherlands.gif|thumb|350px|Animated population pyramid of the Netherlands: 1950-2010]]\nThe following demographic statistics are from [[Cia World Factbook]].<ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html|title= The World FactBook - Netherlands|date=July 12, 2018|work=[[The World Factbook]]}}</ref>\n\n;Population:\n:17,151,228 (July 2018 est.)\n\n;Age structure:\n[[File:Netherlandspop.svg|thumb|right|350px|Population pyramid of Netherlands in 2017]]\n:''0-14 years'': 16.28% (male 1,428,837 /female 1,362,686)\n:''15-24 years'': 12.03% (male 1,052,357 /female 1,011,710)\n:''25-54 years'': 39.18% (male 3,371,698 /female 3,348,595)\n:''55-64 years'': 13.41% (male 1,143,824 /female 1,155,751)\n:''65 years and over'': 19.1% (male 1,487,278 /female 1,788,492) (2018 est.)\n\n;Birth rate: \n:10.9 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)

This means that the country has a population density of {{convert|521|/km2|abbr=on}}. The density of 500 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> was reached in the first half of 2014.\n\n[[Bangladesh]] is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density#density of the most populous countries|only country]] (if not counting the small [[city state|city states]]) larger in total area than and with a higher population density than the Netherlands. There are 11 more countries with a higher population density, but they all have a smaller population (hence a smaller total area). \n\nAs a result of these demographic characteristics the Netherlands has had to plan its [[land management|land use]] strictly. Since 1946 the [[VROM|Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] has been occupied with the national coordination of land use. Because of its high population density the Netherlands has also [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land from the sea]] by [[polder]]ing. Between 1927 and 1968 an entire province, [[Flevoland]] was created. It currently (2015) houses more than 400,000 people. Because of these policies, the Dutch have been able to combine high levels of population density with extremely high levels of [[agriculture|agricultural production]].\n\nEven though the Netherlands is so densely populated, it has no municipalities with a population over one million, although the two largest municipalities of the country do score well over a million if the complete city region is counted, including the neighbouring satellite towns that often are physically connected to the main municipality. Moreover, the \"four big cities\" ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) can in many ways be regarded as a single metropolitan area, the [[Randstad]] (\"rim city\" or \"edge city\") with over 7.5 million inhabitants around an agricultural \"green heart\" (''het [[Groene Hart]]).\n\n{{Largest cities of the Netherlands}}\n\n==Births and deaths==\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:0.5em;

Furthermore, [[life expectancy]] has increased because of developments in [[medicine]], and in addition to this, the Netherlands has seen increasing immigration. Despite these developments combined with the [[population boom]] after the [[Second World War]], the low birth rate has caused extremely low population growth: 2005 saw the lowest absolute population growth since 1900.\n\nThis demographic development has consequences for [[health care]] and [[social security]] policy. As the Dutch population ages, the proportion of people of working age, as a percentage of the entire population, decreases. Important policy advisors like the [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|CBS]] (Statistical Office) and the [[Centraal Planbureau|CPB]] (Planning Office) have pointed out that this will cause problems with the current system of old age pensions: fewer people will work to pay for old age pensions, while there will be more people receiving those pensions. Furthermore, the costs of health care are also projected to increase. These developments have caused several cabinets, most notably the recent [[Second cabinet Balkenende|second Balkenende cabinet]] to reform the system of health care and social security to increase participation in the labour market and make people more conscious of the money they spend on health care.\n\nIn 2003, the annual birth rate per thousand was highest in the province of Flevoland (15.9). The overall lifelong [[Total fertility rate]] (TFR), was highest in the province of Flevoland (2.0) and lowest in the province of Limburg (1.6). The municipality with the highest TFR was Urk (3.23) followed by Valkenburg (2.83), Graafstroom (2.79) and Staphorst (2.76). The lowest TFRs were recorded in Vaals (1.11) and Thorn (1.21).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2003/2003-1269-wm.htm|title=Largest families in Urk|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe total population at December 31, 2006 was 16,356,914. The population loss due to net emigration was 35,502 (an estimated 40-50% of emigrants were ethnic non-Dutch).\n\nIn 2007, there were 117,000 immigrants (including 7000 Germans, 6000 Poles, 5000 Bulgarians, 3000 Turks and 2000 Moroccans) and 123,000 emigrants. Nearly half the emigrants were native Dutch, followed at a distance by nearly 5000 Poles and more than 3000 Germans. There was an observable increase in net immigration from the former USSR, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2008/2008-011-pb.htm|title=Population growth 46 thousand in 2007|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe annual death rate was lowest in the municipalities of Valkenburg (2.9 per 1000), Zeewolde (3.2), Renswoude (3.4), Westervoort and Zeevang (both 3.9).

While during the economic boom of the 1990s their unemployment and dependence on welfare had strongly decreased, the economic downturn between 2001 and 2004 disproportionally affected immigrant groups. This would be explained by their functioning as a labour reserve, by their lower educational levels and by lower language skills. The report also noted that per capita [[social interaction]]s between native Dutch and immigrant populations tended to decline over time, partly explainable by the size growth of immigrant groups. Integration levels strongly varied between groups. Surinamese and Antilleans were well economically integrated, but the latter less so culturally. Cultural integration was limited for Turks, but better for Moroccans. Of the asylum seekers, Somalis were among the least integrated into Dutch society, while Iranians were the best integrated with the highest education levels and modern lifestyles. Though the educational levels of the second generation were a significant improvement over those of the first generation, they still lagged behind the native Dutch who themselves on average had been attending ever higher school types. While half of all native Dutch pupils in 2005 proceeded to higher secondary education (HAVO and VWO), for Turks and Moroccans the share was a fifth and for Somali pupils even lower.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2007, non-Western groups were generally socio-economically disadvantaged and of the four largest non-Western groups, Turks and Moroccans were the most disadvantaged. In 2006 38.7% of Moroccans and 43.9% of Turks aged 15\u201364 were in employment, their unemployment rate was about four times the level of the native Dutch (17.2% for Moroccans and 15.1% for Turks), and 30% received some type of [[Welfare|social welfare]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter 2008, the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|financial crisis]] and the [[eurocrisis]] again hit immigrant groups particularly hard.

In the 1950s 560,000{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} people migrated to the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], leaving their war-torn and overpopulated home country behind. At least 60,000 of these migrants were [[Indo people|Indo-European]] (mixed Dutch-Indonesian) repatriants that moved on, mostly to the United States, after being repatriated to the Netherlands from the former [[Dutch East Indies]] during and after the Indonesian revolution.\n\nIn 2005 some 121,000 people migrated from the Netherlands. There is considerable migration towards neighbouring states, [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and to the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. Furthermore, almost half of the current emigration consists of people returning to their country of birth, including rejected [[asylum seekers]], after the more stringent migration laws were implemented.\n\n==Demographic statistics==\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2019.<ref name=\"WPR 2018\">{{cite|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/netherlands-population/|title=Netherlands Population 2019|website=World Population Review}}</ref>\n\n*One birth every 3 minutes\t\n*One death every 4 minutes\t\n*One net migrant every 31 minutes\t\n*Net gain of one person every 11 minutes\n\n[[File:Animated population pyramid of the Netherlands.gif|thumb|350px|Animated population pyramid of the Netherlands: 1950-2010]]\nThe following demographic statistics are from [[Cia World Factbook]].<ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html|title= The World FactBook - Netherlands|date=July 12, 2018|work=[[The World Factbook]]}}</ref>\n\n;Population:\n:17,151,228 (July 2018 est.)\n\n;Age structure:\n[[File:Netherlandspop.svg|thumb|right|350px|Population pyramid of Netherlands in 2017]]\n:''0-14 years'': 16.28% (male 1,428,837 /female 1,362,686)\n:''15-24 years'': 12.03% (male 1,052,357 /female 1,011,710)\n:''25-54 years'': 39.18% (male 3,371,698 /female 3,348,595)\n:''55-64 years'': 13.41% (male 1,143,824 /female 1,155,751)\n:''65 years and over'': 19.1% (male 1,487,278 /female 1,788,492) (2018 est.)\n\n;Birth rate: \n:10.9 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)
