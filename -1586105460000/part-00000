Gagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], his nation's highest honour.\n\nBorn in the village of [[Klushino]] near Gzhatsk (a [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|town later renamed after him]]), in his youth Gagarin was a [[foundryman]] at a steel plant in [[Lyubertsy]]. He later joined the Soviet Air Forces as a pilot and was stationed at the [[Luostari/Pechenga (air base)|Luostari Air Base]], near the Norwegian border, before his selection for the [[Soviet space program]]me with five other cosmonauts. Following his spaceflight, Gagarin became deputy training director of the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center|Cosmonaut Training Centre]], which was later named after him. He was also elected as a deputy of the [[Soviet of the Union]] in 1962 and then to the [[Soviet of Nationalities]], respectively the [[Lower house|lower]] and [[Upper house|upper]] [[Legislative chamber|chambers]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]].\n\nVostok 1 was Gagarin's only spaceflight but he served as the backup crew to the [[Soyuz 1]] mission, which ended in a fatal crash, killing his friend and fellow cosmonaut [[Vladimir Komarov]]. Fearing for his life, Soviet officials permanently banned Gagarin from further spaceflights. After completing training at the [[Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy]] on 17 February 1968, he was allowed to fly regular aircraft. Gagarin died five weeks later when the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] training jet he was piloting with his flight instructor [[Vladimir Seryogin]] crashed near the town of [[Kirzhach]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nYuri Gagarin was born 9 March 1934 in the village of [[Klushino]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|Shayler|Vis|2007|p=332}}</ref> near Gzhatsk (renamed [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|Gagarin]] in 1968 after his death).<ref>{{harvnb|French|2010|p=270}}</ref> His parents worked on a [[collective farm]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/gagarin.html |title=Yuri Gagarin |magazine=Time Europe |first=Dennis |last=Tito |date=13 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326180036/http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/gagarin.html |archive-date=26 March 2008}}</ref>\u2014Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a [[dairy farmer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Burgess|Hall|pp=41\u201342|2009}}</ref>{{efn|Alexey and Anna's names are sometimes transliterated as Aleksei Ivanovich and Anna Timofeevna, respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jenks|2012a|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref>}} Yuri was the third of four children.

The report states that an air-traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded Gagarin's aircraft entered a [[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]], either due to a [[bird strike]] or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude was higher than it was and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.<ref name=\"telegraph1425937\" /> Another theory, advanced in 2005 by the original crash investigator, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to [[oxygen deprivation]] and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.<ref name=\"Holt\" /> A similar theory, published in ''[[Air & Space]]'' magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.<ref name=\"Osborn\" />\n\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin.

his capsule [[Vostok 1]] completed one orbit of Earth on 12 April 1961. Gagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], his nation's highest honour.\n\nBorn in the village of [[Klushino]] near Gzhatsk (a [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|town later renamed after him]]), in his youth Gagarin was a [[foundryman]] at a steel plant in [[Lyubertsy]]. He later joined the Soviet Air Forces as a pilot and was stationed at the [[Luostari/Pechenga (air base)|Luostari Air Base]], near the Norwegian border, before his selection for the [[Soviet space program]]me with five other cosmonauts. Following his spaceflight, Gagarin became deputy training director of the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center|Cosmonaut Training Centre]], which was later named after him. He was also elected as a deputy of the [[Soviet of the Union]] in 1962 and then to the [[Soviet of Nationalities]], respectively the [[Lower house|lower]] and [[Upper house|upper]] [[Legislative chamber|chambers]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]].\n\nVostok 1 was Gagarin's only spaceflight but he served as the backup crew to the [[Soyuz 1]] mission, which ended in a fatal crash, killing his friend and fellow cosmonaut [[Vladimir Komarov]]. Fearing for his life, Soviet officials permanently banned Gagarin from further spaceflights. After completing training at the [[Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy]] on 17 February 1968, he was allowed to fly regular aircraft. Gagarin died five weeks later when the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] training jet he was piloting with his flight instructor [[Vladimir Seryogin]] crashed near the town of [[Kirzhach]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nYuri Gagarin was born 9 March 1934 in the village of [[Klushino]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|Shayler|Vis|2007|p=332}}</ref> near Gzhatsk (renamed [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|Gagarin]] in 1968 after his death).<ref>{{harvnb|French|2010|p=270}}</ref> His parents worked on a [[collective farm]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/gagarin.html |title=Yuri Gagarin |magazine=Time Europe |first=Dennis |last=Tito |date=13 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326180036/http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/gagarin.html |archive-date=26 March 2008}}</ref>\u2014Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a [[dairy farmer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Burgess|Hall|pp=41\u201342|2009}}</ref>{{efn|Alexey and Anna's names are sometimes transliterated as Aleksei Ivanovich and Anna Timofeevna, respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jenks|2012a|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref>}} Yuri was the third of four children.

The report states that an air-traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded Gagarin's aircraft entered a [[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]], either due to a [[bird strike]] or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude was higher than it was and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.<ref name=\"telegraph1425937\" /> Another theory, advanced in 2005 by the original crash investigator, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to [[oxygen deprivation]] and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.<ref name=\"Holt\" /> A similar theory, published in ''[[Air & Space]]'' magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude.
