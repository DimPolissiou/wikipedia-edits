Cromwell had hoped that the marriage would breathe fresh life into the Reformation in England, but Henry found his new bride unattractive and it turned into a disaster for Cromwell, ending in an annulment six months later. Cromwell was [[arraignment|arraigned]] under a [[bill of attainder]] and executed for [[treason]] and [[heresy]] on [[Tower Hill]] on 28 July 1540.

It is believed that he was born at the top of Putney Hill, on the edge of [[Putney Heath]].  In 1878, his birthplace was still of note:\n<blockquote>The site of Cromwell's birthplace is still pointed out by tradition and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor, quoted above, for it describes on that spot 'an ancient cottage called the smith's shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor'.

Accounts of his activities in France, Italy and the [[Low Countries]] are sketchy and contradictory.

At some point he returned to Italy.

By the end of October of that year, however, Wolsey had fallen from power.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Cromwell had made enemies by aiding Wolsey to suppress the monasteries, but was determined not to fall with his master, as he told [[George Cavendish (writer)|George Cavendish]], then a Gentleman Usher and later Wolsey's biographer:<blockquote>I do entend (god wyllyng) this after none, whan my lord hathe dyned to ride to london and so to the Court, where I wyll other make or marre, or ere [before] I come agayn, I wyll put my self in the prese [press] to se what any man is Able to lay to my charge of ontrouthe or mysdemeanor.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}</blockquote>\n\n==Royal favourite==\nCromwell successfully overcame the shadow cast over his career by Wolsey's downfall.

At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king's legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], and had joined the inner circle of the Council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe third session of what is now known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of government indecision as to the best way to proceed. Cromwell now favoured the assertion of royal supremacy, and manipulated the Commons by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier in the session of 1529. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the king, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as \"the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender\" of the Church. The clergy resisted the Act of 1529 where they were prevented from appealing to Church-established courts, or [[Ecclesiastical court]] to settle disputes. Instead they were forced to go through the public courts as lay people.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The clergy capitulated when faced with the threat of parliamentary reprisal. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was [[prorogued]]. Two days later, [[Sir Thomas More]] resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More's resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe king's gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the lordship of Romney{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in Newport, Wales, and appointment to three relatively minor offices: [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the Jewels]] on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the [[Hanaper]] on 16 July, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 12 April 1533. None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Anneboleyn2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Anne Boleyn]]]]\n\nOn 26 January 1533, Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor, and <!--on the same day?-->Cromwell increased his control over the Commons through his management of by-elections. Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that historians believe took place in Calais. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid.\n\nThe parliamentary session began on 4 February, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome. On 30 March, Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] immediately declared the king's marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell's bill into law, as the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], ensuring that any verdict concerning the king's marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King a pro forma challenge to the validity of his marriage to Catherine. A formal trial began on 10 May 1533 in Dunstable and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced sentence, declaring the marriage illegal. Five days later he pronounced the King's marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy and the Pope was attacked throughout the nation in sermons and pamphlets. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell's supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England's remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer's sentence took statutory form as the Act of Succession, the Dispensations Act reiterated royal supremacy and the Act for the Submission of the Clergy incorporated into law the clergy's surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==King's chief minister==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nIn April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name. Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession, and all the King's subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King's new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later.\n\nOn 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy also clarified the King's position as head of the church and the Act for Payment of First Fruits and Tenths substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church. On 21 January 1535, the King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and commissioned him to organise visitations of all the country's churches, monasteries, and clergy. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to tax church property more effectively.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Fall of Anne Boleyn===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Jane Seymour]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, an Act for the Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than \u00a3200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell's strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King's coffers.<ref>Eric Ives \"the Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\"</ref>\n\nAnne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her [[almoner]], [[John Skip]], denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skip's diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skip was called before the Council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking 'the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth' and inviting anarchy.{{sfn|Ives|2005|pp=307\u2013310}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=176\u2013179}}\n\nAnne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was growing impatient, having become enamoured of the young [[Jane Seymour]] and encouraged by Anne's enemies, particularly Nicholas Carew and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with [[Mark Smeaton]], a musician of the royal household, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norris]], the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir [[Francis Weston]], [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]] and her brother, [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|Viscount Rochford]].{{sfn|Lipscomb|April 2013|pp=18\u201324}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=192\u2013205}} The Imperial Ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that: <blockquote>he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble...

The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the second Act of Succession, securing the rights of Queen Jane's heirs to the throne.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Thomas Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, KG.png|thumb|220px|Cromwell's arms as they were before his son's marriage to the queen's sister.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=38\u20139, note 81}}]]\nCromwell's position was now stronger than ever.

This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed \"popish\" and \"superstitious\". This has been described as \"easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history\". [[Oxford University]] was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley's donation in 1602.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SochIc9cRGQC&pg=PT58|title=Mediaeval Education and the Reformation|author=John Lawson|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=17 November 2015|isbn=9781135031091}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop [[Edward Foxe]] tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the [[Ten Articles]] and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in [[Lincolnshire]] and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular and clerical uprisings found support among the gentry and even the nobility; they were collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The pilgrimage of grace and the politics of the 1530s|last=Hoyle, R.

One of the leaders of the rebellion was [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy]], who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning (just prior to his execution) \"others that have been in such favour with kings as you now enjoy have come to the same fate you bring me to\".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Thomas Cromwell medal, 1538 side 2.png|thumbnail|right|Portrait medal made for Thomas Cromwell in 1538.

In February 1537, Cromwell convened a [[vicegerent]]ial [[synod]] of bishops and doctors. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'', more commonly known as the [[Bishops' Book]]. By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell's success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a [[Privy Council]], a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what was termed \"idolatry\" by the followers of the old religion. Statues, [[rood screen]]s, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on \"pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions\" and commanding that \"one book of the whole Bible in English\" be set up in every church. Moreover, following the \"voluntary\" surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also \"invited\" to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n====Resistance to further religious reform====\nThe King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], [[Sir Edward Neville]], and Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] on charges of treason in November 1538, using evidence acquired from [[Sir Geoffrey Pole]] under interrogation in the Tower. All were executed in the following months.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOn 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of [[Miles Coverdale]]'s [[Great Bible]]. Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell's principal achievements, the first authoritative version in English.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Anne of Cleves===\n[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''[[Anne of Cleves]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1539]]\n\nQueen Jane had died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future [[Edward VI]]. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell's suggestion that he should marry [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke Wilhelm]] of [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Cleves]], partly on the basis of a portrait which [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year's Day 1540, the King met her at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and was immediately repelled by her physically: \"I like her not!\" The wedding ceremony took place on 6 January at Greenwich, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=377\u201378, 386\u201388, 395, 405, 410\u201311}}\n\n===Earl of Essex===\nOn 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the [[Earl of Essex|earldom of Essex]] and the senior Court office of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell's tenure as the King's chief minister was almost over. The King's anger at being forced to marry Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell's conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, needed to topple him.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=412, 418}}\n\n=== Downfall and execution===\nDuring 1536 Cromwell had proven himself an adept political survivor. However, the gradual slide towards Protestantism at home and the King's ill-starred marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was partly responsible for Cromwell's downfall because he had provided a very flattering portrait of Anne which may have deceived the king. (The 65 \u00d7 48&nbsp;cm painting is now displayed at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.)

He was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. His enemies took every opportunity to humiliate him: they even tore off his [[Order of the Garter]], remarking that \"A traitor must not wear it.\" His initial reaction was defiance: \"This then is my reward for faithful service!\" he cried out,  and angrily defied his fellow Councillors to call him a traitor.

In 1536, he established the [[Court of Augmentations]] to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] and the [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths]], owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the [[Council of the North]], extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against [[enclosure]]s, the promotion of English cloth exports and the [[poor relief]] legislation of 1536.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==Personal religious beliefs==\nAlthough Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the [[Henrician Reformation]] was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb.

In the fiction, he is imbued with family affections, genuine respect for Cardinal Wolsey, zeal for the Reformation, and support for a limited degree of social reform, while the villainous character is [[Thomas More]].\n\n===Theatre===\n* Cromwell is a supporting character in [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s 1613 play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]''.\n* He is the subject of ''[[Thomas Lord Cromwell]]'', a 1602 play. It is attributed on the title pages of the 1603 and 1613 editions to 'W.S.', and is classed as part of Shakespearean apocrypha.\n*In the original stage production of [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'', which deals with the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Cromwell was portrayed by Wendell K. Phillips. He is depicted here as totally ruthless and unscrupulous.\n* Cromwell is the main antagonist in [[Robert Bolt]]'s play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'', in which he is portrayed as ruthlessly ambitious and jealous of Sir Thomas More's influence with the King. Cromwell was played by [[Andrew Keir]] when the play opened in London, and by [[Leo McKern]] on Broadway.\n* Cromwell was portrayed by John Dougall in [[Shakespeare's Globe]]'s production of ''[[Anne Boleyn (play)|Anne Boleyn]]'' by [[Howard Brenton]] in 2010, and Julius D'Silva in 2011.\n*Cromwell was portrayed in ''Henry VIII The Musical'', a youth production that premi\u00e8red in London in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henry VIII The Musical|url=http://www.henryviiithemusical.com|publisher=Henryviiithemusical.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref>\n*In 2014 the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] staged an adaptation by [[Mike Poulton]] of Dame [[Hilary Mantel]]'s first two Cromwell novels.

The series 'Tudor Crimes' covers the years from 1529 to 1551 in great depth and provides us with a dichotomy of a man, humane to the poor, yet ruthless to the nobility. ''Winter King'' is the first book in this series. \n* Cromwell is the subject of [[Hilary Mantel]]'s novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'' (2012), which explore his humanity and to some extent rebut the unflattering portrait in ''A Man for All Seasons''. ''Wolf Hall'' won the 2009 and ''Bring Up the Bodies'' the 2012 [[Man Booker Prize]]. The last book by Mantel in the trilogy is ''[[The Mirror and the Light]]'', which was published in March 2020. \n* Cromwell is one of  the major characters of ''Frailty of Human Affairs'' (2017), book one of the Queenmaker Series, and book two ''Shaking the Throne'' (2018)\" about Cromwell and his secretary Nicola Fresocobaldi, by Caroline Angus-Baker.\n* Cromwell is a leading character in the first two Matthew Shardlake historical crime fiction novels by [[C. J. Sansom]], ''[[Dissolution (Sansom novel)|Dissolution]]'' and ''[[Dark Fire (Sansom novel)|Dark Fire]]''.\n* He is given minor roles in two of [[Philippa Gregory]]'s novels, ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]''.\n* He is one of the major characters in [[H. F. M. Prescott]]'s novel ''The Man on a Donkey'', which depicts a power struggle between Cromwell and [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Lord Darcy]], who represents the old nobility.\n*He is a major character in ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' by [[Ford Madox Ford]].\n\n===Film===\n* [[Franklin Dyall]] portrayed Cromwell in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933).\n* In the film [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|''A Man for All Seasons'']], Cromwell was played by [[Leo McKern]], who also played the role on stage on Broadway.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm| title = A Man for All Seasons, full cast| accessdate = 28 October 2014| publisher = Internet Movie Database}}</ref>\n* Cromwell has also been portrayed by [[John Colicos]] in the film ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'' (1969), by [[Kenneth Williams]] in the classic British comedy ''[[Carry On Henry]]'' (1971), by [[Donald Pleasence]] in ''[[Henry VIII and His Six Wives (film)|Henry VIII and His Six Wives]]'' (1972), and by Iain Mitchell in ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)|The Other Boleyn Girl]]'' (2008).\n\n===Television===\n* Cromwell was played by [[Wolfe Morris]] in the BBC miniseries ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1970), and by [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] in the Granada Television production ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]'' (2003). In the television version of ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' (2003), he was played by veteran actor [[Ron Cook]].\n* In the television series ''[[The Tudors]]'' (2007), Cromwell was played by English actor [[James Frain]]; he is portrayed as Machiavellian, cunning and devoted to the English Reformation at any cost, though he is not entirely unsympathetic. Frain played the character for three seasons; Cromwell's execution brought the third season to its conclusion.\n* In ''The Twisted Tale of Bloody Mary'' (2008), an independent film from TV Choice Productions, Cromwell is played by Burtie Welland.\n* Thomas Cromwell, played by [[Mark Rylance]], is the central figure in the [[BBC]]'s six-part series ''[[Wolf Hall (TV series)|Wolf Hall]]'', based on [[Hilary Mantel]]'s novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' and ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'', which was first broadcast on 21 January 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21712688|title=Mark Rylance set for Hilary Mantel TV drama|work=BBC News|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Beazley\n  |first=F.

and statesman who served as chief minister to King [[Henry VIII of England]] from 1532 to 1540, when he was beheaded on orders of the king.\n\nCromwell was one of the strongest and most powerful proponents of the [[English Reformation]]. He helped to engineer an annulment of the king's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that Henry could lawfully marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Henry failed to obtain [[Pope Clement VII|the Pope]]'s approval for the [[annulment]] in 1534, so Parliament endorsed the king's claim to be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], giving him the authority to annul his own marriage. However, Cromwell subsequently charted an evangelical and reformist course for the [[Church of England]] from the unique posts of [[Vicegerent]] in Spirituals and [[vicar-general]].<ref name=\"Logan (1988)\">Logan argues that these titles refer to a single position. {{cite journal|author1=F.

Cromwell had hoped that the marriage would breathe fresh life into the Reformation in England, but Henry found his new bride unattractive and it turned into a disaster for Cromwell, ending in an annulment six months later. Cromwell was [[arraignment|arraigned]] under a [[bill of attainder]] and executed for [[treason]] and [[heresy]] on [[Tower Hill]] on 28 July 1540. The king later expressed regret at the loss of his chief minister.{{sfn|Hutchinson|2008|p=269}}\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Cromwell was born around 1485, in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]], the son of Walter Cromwell, a blacksmith, [[fulling|fuller]] and cloth merchant, and owner of both a [[inn|hostelry]] and a [[brewery]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Walter Cromwell is considered by some to be of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=36}} Thomas's mother, Katherine Maverell, was the aunt of Nicholas Glossop of [[Wirksworth]] in Derbyshire. She lived in Putney in the house of a local attorney, John Welbeck, at the time of her marriage to Walter Cromwell in 1474.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nCromwell had two sisters: Katherine, married [[Morgan ap William|Morgan Williams]], a Welsh lawyer; the younger, Elizabeth, married a farmer, William Wellyfed.{{sfn|Gerhold|2017|p=26: Which sister was the elder is unknown}}  Katherine and Morgan's son, [[Richard Williams (alias Cromwell)|Richard]], was employed in his uncle's service and by the autumn of 1529 had changed his name to Cromwell.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=38}}\n\nLittle is known about Cromwell's early life. It is believed that he was born at the top of Putney Hill, on the edge of [[Putney Heath]].  In 1878, his birthplace was still of note:\n<blockquote>The site of Cromwell's birthplace is still pointed out by tradition and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor, quoted above, for it describes on that spot 'an ancient cottage called the smith's shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor'.

At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king's legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], and had joined the inner circle of the Council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe third session of what is now known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of government indecision as to the best way to proceed. Cromwell now favoured the assertion of royal supremacy, and manipulated the Commons by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier in the session of 1529. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the king, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as \"the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender\" of the Church. The clergy resisted the Act of 1529 where they were prevented from appealing to Church-established courts, or [[Ecclesiastical court]] to settle disputes. Instead they were forced to go through the public courts as lay people.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The clergy capitulated when faced with the threat of parliamentary reprisal. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was [[prorogued]]. Two days later, [[Sir Thomas More]] resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More's resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe king's gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the lordship of Romney{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in Newport, Wales, and appointment to three relatively minor offices: [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the Jewels]] on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the [[Hanaper]] on 16 July, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 12 April 1533. None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Anneboleyn2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Anne Boleyn]]]]\n\nOn 26 January 1533, Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor, and <!--on the same day?-->Cromwell increased his control over the Commons through his management of by-elections. Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that historians believe took place in Calais. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid.\n\nThe parliamentary session began on 4 February, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome. On 30 March, Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] immediately declared the king's marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell's bill into law, as the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], ensuring that any verdict concerning the king's marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King a pro forma challenge to the validity of his marriage to Catherine. A formal trial began on 10 May 1533 in Dunstable and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced sentence, declaring the marriage illegal. Five days later he pronounced the King's marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy and the Pope was attacked throughout the nation in sermons and pamphlets. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell's supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England's remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer's sentence took statutory form as the Act of Succession, the Dispensations Act reiterated royal supremacy and the Act for the Submission of the Clergy incorporated into law the clergy's surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==King's chief minister==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nIn April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name. Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession, and all the King's subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King's new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later.\n\nOn 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy also clarified the King's position as head of the church and the Act for Payment of First Fruits and Tenths substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church. On 21 January 1535, the King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and commissioned him to organise visitations of all the country's churches, monasteries, and clergy. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to tax church property more effectively.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Fall of Anne Boleyn===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Jane Seymour]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, an Act for the Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than \u00a3200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell's strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King's coffers.<ref>Eric Ives \"the Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\"</ref>\n\nAnne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her [[almoner]], [[John Skip]], denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skip's diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skip was called before the Council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking 'the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth' and inviting anarchy.{{sfn|Ives|2005|pp=307\u2013310}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=176\u2013179}}\n\nAnne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was growing impatient, having become enamoured of the young [[Jane Seymour]] and encouraged by Anne's enemies, particularly Nicholas Carew and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with [[Mark Smeaton]], a musician of the royal household, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norris]], the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir [[Francis Weston]], [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]] and her brother, [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|Viscount Rochford]].{{sfn|Lipscomb|April 2013|pp=18\u201324}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=192\u2013205}} The Imperial Ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that: <blockquote>he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble...

The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the second Act of Succession, securing the rights of Queen Jane's heirs to the throne.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Thomas Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, KG.png|thumb|220px|Cromwell's arms as they were before his son's marriage to the queen's sister.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=38\u20139, note 81}}]]\nCromwell's position was now stronger than ever.

This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed \"popish\" and \"superstitious\". This has been described as \"easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history\". [[Oxford University]] was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley's donation in 1602.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SochIc9cRGQC&pg=PT58|title=Mediaeval Education and the Reformation|author=John Lawson|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=17 November 2015|isbn=9781135031091}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop [[Edward Foxe]] tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the [[Ten Articles]] and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in [[Lincolnshire]] and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular and clerical uprisings found support among the gentry and even the nobility; they were collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The pilgrimage of grace and the politics of the 1530s|last=Hoyle, R.

One of the leaders of the rebellion was [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy]], who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning (just prior to his execution) \"others that have been in such favour with kings as you now enjoy have come to the same fate you bring me to\".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Thomas Cromwell medal, 1538 side 2.png|thumbnail|right|Portrait medal made for Thomas Cromwell in 1538.

In February 1537, Cromwell convened a [[vicegerent]]ial [[synod]] of bishops and doctors. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'', more commonly known as the [[Bishops' Book]]. By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell's success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a [[Privy Council]], a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what was termed \"idolatry\" by the followers of the old religion. Statues, [[rood screen]]s, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on \"pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions\" and commanding that \"one book of the whole Bible in English\" be set up in every church. Moreover, following the \"voluntary\" surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also \"invited\" to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n====Resistance to further religious reform====\nThe King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], [[Sir Edward Neville]], and Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] on charges of treason in November 1538, using evidence acquired from [[Sir Geoffrey Pole]] under interrogation in the Tower. All were executed in the following months.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOn 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of [[Miles Coverdale]]'s [[Great Bible]]. Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell's principal achievements, the first authoritative version in English.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Anne of Cleves===\n[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''[[Anne of Cleves]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1539]]\n\nQueen Jane had died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future [[Edward VI]]. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell's suggestion that he should marry [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke Wilhelm]] of [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Cleves]], partly on the basis of a portrait which [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year's Day 1540, the King met her at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and was immediately repelled by her physically: \"I like her not!\" The wedding ceremony took place on 6 January at Greenwich, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=377\u201378, 386\u201388, 395, 405, 410\u201311}}\n\n===Earl of Essex===\nOn 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the [[Earl of Essex|earldom of Essex]] and the senior Court office of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell's tenure as the King's chief minister was almost over. The King's anger at being forced to marry Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell's conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, needed to topple him.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=412, 418}}\n\n=== Downfall and execution===\nDuring 1536 Cromwell had proven himself an adept political survivor. However, the gradual slide towards Protestantism at home and the King's ill-starred marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was partly responsible for Cromwell's downfall because he had provided a very flattering portrait of Anne which may have deceived the king. (The 65 \u00d7 48&nbsp;cm painting is now displayed at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.) When Henry finally met her, the king was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall#v=onepage&q=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&f=false|title=England Under the Tudors|first=G.

In 1536, he established the [[Court of Augmentations]] to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] and the [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths]], owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the [[Council of the North]], extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against [[enclosure]]s, the promotion of English cloth exports and the [[poor relief]] legislation of 1536.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==Personal religious beliefs==\nAlthough Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the [[Henrician Reformation]] was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb. For instance, in the mid-1530s, he promoted Protestant ideas to forge an alliance with German Lutheran states, but his support for the Protestant cause is too general to be accurately explained in narrow political terms.<ref>William Underwood, \"Thomas Cromwell and William Marshall's Protestant books\".

He acted in more than 100 films in roles covering a wide range of genres, from light comedy to serious drama. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.\n\nAlthough his early film roles mainly took advantage of his good looks, by the latter half of the 1950s he had demonstrated range and depth in numerous dramatic and comedy roles. In his earliest parts he acted in a string of mediocre films, including [[swashbuckler film|swashbucklers]], westerns, light comedies, sports films and a musical. However, by the time he starred in ''[[Houdini (1953 film)|Houdini]]'' (1953) with his wife [[Janet Leigh]], \"his first clear success,\" notes critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], his acting had progressed immensely.<ref name=Siegel>{{cite book| last=Siegel| first=Scott and Barbara| title=The Encyclopedia of Hollywood| edition=2nd| publisher=Facts on File| year=2004| pages=108\u2013109| isbn=978-0816046232}}</ref><ref name=Thomson>{{cite book| last=Thomson| first=David| title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qt2BAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+New+Biographical+Dictionary+of+Film&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN9qDDyNjgAhVyq4MKHfSACvEQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Tony%20Curtis&f=false| edition=sixth| date=May 6, 2014| publisher=Knopf Doubleday| isbn=978-1101874707}}</ref>\n\nHe achieved his first serious recognition as a dramatic actor in ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957) with co-star [[Burt Lancaster]]. The following year he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'' (1958) alongside [[Sidney Poitier]] (who was also nominated in the same category). Curtis then gave what could arguably be called his best performance: three interrelated roles in the comedy ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959). Thomson called it an \"outrageous film,\" and an [[American Film Institute]] survey voted it the funniest American film ever made.<ref name=foxnews>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/09/30/reports-actor-tony-curtis-dead/| title=Hollywood Legend Tony Curtis Dead at 85| work=Fox News| date=September 30, 2010| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The film co-starred [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]], and was directed by [[Billy Wilder]].

In 1960, Curtis played a supporting role in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', which became another major hit for him.\n\nHis stardom and film career declined considerably after 1960. His most significant dramatic part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]'', which some consider his last major film role.<ref name=McCarty/> The part reinforced his reputation as a serious actor with his chilling portrayal of serial killer [[Albert DeSalvo]].Curtis also took on the role of the Ukrainian Cossack Andrei in historical action romance epic Taras Bulba in which the lead character was played by Yul Bryner in 1966.\n\nHe later starred alongside [[Roger Moore]] in the [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] TV series ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', with Curtis playing American millionaire Danny Wilde.

His brother Robert was [[Involuntary commitment|institutionalized]] with the same mental illness.\n\nWhen Curtis was eight, he and his brother Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a neighborhood gang whose main crimes were playing truant from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] by sending him to a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended [[Seward Park High School]]. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.<ref name=Lifemag/>\n\n===Military service===\nCurtis enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Inspired by [[Cary Grant]]'s role in ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' and [[Tyrone Power]]'s in ''[[Crash Dive]]'' (1943), he joined the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Pacific submarine force]].<ref name=\"tcmcurtis\">''Private Screenings: Tony Curtis'' [[Turner Classic Movies]], January 19, 1999.</ref> Curtis served aboard a [[submarine tender]], the [[USS Proteus (AS-19)|USS ''Proteus'']]'','' until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

His contemporaries included [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Bea Arthur|Beatrice Arthur]], and [[Rod Steiger]]. While still at college, Curtis was discovered by [[Joyce Selznick]], the notable [[talent agent]], [[casting director]], and niece of film producer [[David O. Selznick]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1948, Curtis arrived in [[Hollywood]] at age 23. In his autobiography, Curtis described how by chance he met Jack Warner on the plane to California, and also how he briefly dated [[Marilyn Monroe]] before either was famous.\n\n===Universal as \"Anthony Curtis\"===\nUnder contract at [[Universal Pictures]], he changed his name from '''Bernard Schwartz''' to '''Anthony Curtis''' and met unknown actors [[Rock Hudson]], [[James Best]], [[Julie Adams]] and [[Piper Laurie]].<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.com/2012/04/julie-adams-at-85.html| title='Julie Adams at 85'| website=Great Entertainers Archives.com| date=April 9, 2012| first=David| last=Lobosco|  access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> The first name was from the novel ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' and \"Curtis\" was from Kurtz, a surname in his mother's family.<ref name=\"ref091\">{{cite news | last = Rizzo| first = Frank| title = My Interview With Tony Curtis | newspaper = [[Hartford Courant]] | date = October 1, 2009 | access-date = October 1, 2009| url-status=dead| archive-date = July 7, 2012 | url = http://blogs.courant.com/curtain/2009/10/my-interview-with-tony-curtis.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707005014/http://blogs.courant.com/curtain/2009/10/my-interview-with-tony-curtis.html}}</ref> Although Universal Pictures taught him fencing and riding, in keeping with the cinematic themes of the era, Curtis admitted he was at first interested only in girls and money. Neither was he hopeful of his chances of becoming a major star. Curtis's biggest fear was having to return home to the Bronx as a failure:\n\n<blockquote>I was a million-to-one shot, the ''least'' likely to succeed.

The male star was [[Burt Lancaster]] who would make a number of films with Curtis.\n\nIn his second film, ''[[City Across the River]]'' (also in 1949), he was credited as \"Anthony Curtis\".<ref>{{IMDb title|0041251|title=City Across the River}}</ref> He had four lines in ''[[The Lady Gambles]]'' (1949) and a bigger part in ''[[Johnny Stool Pigeon]]'' (1949). He could also be spotted in ''[[Francis (film)|Francis]]'' (1950), ''[[Woman in Hiding]]'' (1950), and ''[[I Was a Shoplifter]]'' (1950).\n\nHe was in three Westerns, ''[[Sierra (film)|Sierra]]'' (1950), starring [[Audie Murphy]], one of many names he worked with (including fellow Universal contractee, [[Rock Hudson]]), ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950), starring [[James Stewart]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. He supported Murphy in another Western, ''[[Kansas Raiders]]'' (1951), playing [[Kit Dalton]]; this time he was billed as \"Tony Curtis\".\n\n===Stardom===\nCurtis was receiving numerous fan letters, so Universal awarded him the starring role in ''[[The Prince Who Was a Thief]]'' (1951), a [[swashbuckler]] set in the Middle East with Piper Laurie. It was a hit at the box office and Curtis was now established.\n\nHe followed it up with ''[[Flesh and Fury]]'' (1952), a boxing movie; ''[[No Room for the Groom]]'' (1952), a comedy with Laurie directed by [[Douglas Sirk]]; and ''[[Son of Ali Baba]]'' (1952), another film set in the Arab world with Laurie.\n\nCurtis then teamed up with then-wife [[Janet Leigh]] in ''[[Houdini (1953 film)|Houdini]]'' (1953), in which Curtis played the title role. His next movies were more \"B\" fare: ''[[All American (film)|All American]]'' (1953), as a footballer; ''[[Forbidden (1953 film)|Forbidden]]'' (1953), as a criminal; ''[[Beachhead (film)|Beachhead]]'' (1954), a war film; ''[[Johnny Dark (film)|Johnny Dark]]'' (1954), with Laurie, as a racing car driver; and ''[[The Black Shield of Falworth]]'' (1954), a medieval swashbuckler with Leigh. The box office performances of these films were solid, and Curtis was growing in popularity.\n\nFor a change of pace he did a musical, ''[[So This Is Paris (1955 film)|So This Is Paris]]'' (1955), then it was back to more typical fare: ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' (1955), as a bank robber; ''[[The Purple Mask]]'' (1955), a swashbuckler; ''[[The Square Jungle]]'' (1955), a boxing film.\n\n===Major star===\nCurtis graduated to more prestigious projects when he was cast in support of [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] in ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956). It was one of the biggest hits of the year.\n\nCurtis made a Western, ''[[The Rawhide Years]]'' (1957); was a gambler in ''[[Mister Cory]]'' (1957); and was a cop in ''[[The Midnight Story]]'' (1957). Lancaster asked for him again, to play scheming press agent Sidney Falco in ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]''  (1957), starring and co-produced by Lancaster. The film was a box office disappointment, but Curtis, for the first time in his career, received sensational reviews.\n\nAnother star-maker was eager to work with him - [[Kirk Douglas]] - in ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958). Janet Leigh also starred, and the resulting movie was a box office hit. Curtis then co-starred with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[Kings Go Forth]]'' (1958), a war story. It was mildly popular, but ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'' (1958), was a bigger success. Curtis gave an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated performance as a bigoted white escaped convict chained to a black man, [[Sidney Poitier]].\n[[File:Monroe and Curtis in Some Like it Hot.JPG|thumb|<center>Curtis with [[Marilyn Monroe]] in<br>''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959)</center>]]\n\nCurtis and Janet Leigh then made a popular comedy for [[Blake Edwards]] at Universal, ''[[The Perfect Furlough]]'' (1958). He co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959). It was a huge success and became a classic; equally popular was ''[[Operation Petticoat]]'' (1959), a military comedy which Curtis made for Edwards alongside [[Cary Grant]].\n\nCurtis and Leigh made one more film together ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' (1960), a comedy with [[Dean Martin]]. He and [[Debbie Reynolds]] then starred in ''[[The Rat Race]]'' (1960).\n\nDouglas came calling again, offering Curtis a key role in the former's epic production ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960). It was a huge hit and earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nCurtis then made his first movies in a while without a significant \"name\" co star. Both were biopics: ''[[The Great Impostor]]'' (1961), directed by [[Robert Mulligan]], playing [[Ferdinand Waldo Demara]]; and ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' (1961), where he played war hero [[Ira Hayes]]. He went back to epics with ''[[Taras Bulba (1962 film)|Taras Bulba]]'' (1962), co starring [[Yul Brynner]] and [[Christine Kaufmann]], who soon became Curtis' second wife.\n\n===Comedic roles===\nHe starred with [[Suzanne Pleshette]] in the comedy ''[[40 Pounds of Trouble]]'' (1962), which was a mild hit.\n\nCurtis was one of many stars who had small roles in ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963). He supported [[Gregory Peck]] in ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963) and had an uncredited dual role in ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]'' (1964). He and Kaufman made their third movie together, the comedy ''[[Wild and Wonderful]]'' (1964). His focus remained on comedies: ''[[Goodbye Charlie]]'' (1964), with Debbie Reynolds; ''[[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|Sex and the Single Girl]]'' (1964), with Natalie Wood; ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965), with Wood and Lemmon for Blake Edwards \u2014 the most expensive comedy film up till that time, but popular; ''[[Boeing Boeing (1965 film)|Boeing Boeing]]'' (1965) a sex farce with [[Jerry Lewis]]; ''[[Not with My Wife, You Don't!]]'' (1966) with [[George C. Scott]]; ''[[Drop Dead Darling]]'' (1966), a British comedy; ''[[Don't Make Waves]]'' (1967), a satire of beach life from director Alexander Mackendrick, with [[Claudia Cardinale]]; and ''[[On My Way to the Crusades, I Met a Girl Who...]]'' (1967), an Italian comedy with [[Monica Vitti]].  In the early 1960s, he was a voice-over guest star on ''[[The Flintstones]]'' as \"Stoney Curtis\".\n\n===''The Boston Strangler''===\nCurtis's first dramatic film after a number of years was ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]'' (1968) playing the title role. Response from the critics and public was excellent. He returned to comedy for ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust!]]'' (1969), an all-star car race film in the vein of ''The Great Race''.\n\nHe made some comic adventure tales: ''[[You Can't Win 'Em All]]'' (1970) with [[Charles Bronson]] and ''[[Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came]]'' (1970).\n\nCurtis decided it was time to turn to television and co-starred with [[Roger Moore]] in the TV series ''[[The Persuaders!]]''.\n\nHe was one of the villains in ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1975 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1975) and had the title role in the gangster film ''[[Lepke (film)|Lepke]]'' (1975). Curtis had the lead in a TV series that did not last,  ''[[McCoy (TV series)|McCoy]]'' (1975\u201376). He  was one of many names in ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'' (1976) and had the title role in an Italian comedy ''[[Casanova & Co.]]'' (1977). Later, he co-starred in ''[[Vega$]]'' and was in ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978).\n\n===Later career===\nCurtis supported [[Mae West]] in ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978) and starred in ''[[The Manitou]]'' (1978), a horror film, and ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' (1978), a comedy. He had good roles in ''[[It Rained All Night the Day I Left]]'' (1980), ''[[Little Miss Marker (1980 film)|Little Miss Marker]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Scarlett O'Hara War]]'' (1980) and was one of many stars in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (1980). On television, he continued to make occasional guest appearances (sometimes playing fictional versions of himself) into the mid-2000s. His final TV series was as host of the documentary-retrospective series (adapting [[Kenneth Anger]]'s [[Hollywood Babylon|book series]]) in 1992\u20131993; each episode would include Curtis recalling some anecdotes from his own career.\n\n===Painter===\nThroughout his life, Curtis enjoyed painting and, since the early 1980s, painted as a second career. His work commands more than $25,000 a canvas now. In the last years of his life, he concentrated on painting rather than movies. A [[surrealist]], Curtis claimed [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]], [[Paul Matisse|<nowiki>[Paul] </nowiki>Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte]] as influences.<ref name=\"tcmcurtis\"/> \"I still make movies but I'm not that interested in them any more. But I paint all the time.\" In 2007, his painting ''The Red Table'' was on display in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. His paintings can also be seen at the [[Tony Vanderploeg]] Gallery in [[Carmel, California]].\n\nCurtis spoke of his disappointment at never being awarded an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]. In March 2006, Curtis received the [[Empire Awards|Sony Ericsson Empire Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] inducted in 1960, and received the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' from France in 1995.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Marriages and children===\nCurtis was married six times.<ref name = portrait /> His first wife was actress [[Janet Leigh]], to whom he was married from 1951 to 1962, and with whom he fathered actresses [[Kelly Curtis|Kelly]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis|Jamie Lee]]. \"For a while, we were Hollywood's golden couple,\" he said. \"I was very dedicated and devoted to Janet, and on top of my trade, but in her eyes that goldenness started to wear off.

He acted in more than 100 films in roles covering a wide range of genres, from light comedy to serious drama. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.\n\nAlthough his early film roles mainly took advantage of his good looks, by the latter half of the 1950s he had demonstrated range and depth in numerous dramatic and comedy roles. In his earliest parts he acted in a string of mediocre films, including [[swashbuckler film|swashbucklers]], westerns, light comedies, sports films and a musical. However, by the time he starred in ''[[Houdini (1953 film)|Houdini]]'' (1953) with his wife [[Janet Leigh]], \"his first clear success,\" notes critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], his acting had progressed immensely.<ref name=Siegel>{{cite book| last=Siegel| first=Scott and Barbara| title=The Encyclopedia of Hollywood| edition=2nd| publisher=Facts on File| year=2004| pages=108\u2013109| isbn=978-0816046232}}</ref><ref name=Thomson>{{cite book| last=Thomson| first=David| title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qt2BAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+New+Biographical+Dictionary+of+Film&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN9qDDyNjgAhVyq4MKHfSACvEQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Tony%20Curtis&f=false| edition=sixth| date=May 6, 2014| publisher=Knopf Doubleday| isbn=978-1101874707}}</ref>\n\nHe achieved his first serious recognition as a dramatic actor in ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957) with co-star [[Burt Lancaster]]. The following year he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'' (1958) alongside [[Sidney Poitier]] (who was also nominated in the same category). Curtis then gave what could arguably be called his best performance: three interrelated roles in the comedy ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959). Thomson called it an \"outrageous film,\" and an [[American Film Institute]] survey voted it the funniest American film ever made.<ref name=foxnews>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/09/30/reports-actor-tony-curtis-dead/| title=Hollywood Legend Tony Curtis Dead at 85| work=Fox News| date=September 30, 2010| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The film co-starred [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]], and was directed by [[Billy Wilder]].

In 1960, Curtis played a supporting role in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', which became another major hit for him.\n\nHis stardom and film career declined considerably after 1960. His most significant dramatic part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]'', which some consider his last major film role.<ref name=McCarty/> The part reinforced his reputation as a serious actor with his chilling portrayal of serial killer [[Albert DeSalvo]].Curtis also took on the role of the Ukrainian Cossack Andrei in historical action romance epic Taras Bulba in which the lead character was played by Yul Bryner in 1966. \n\nHe later starred alongside [[Roger Moore]] in the [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] TV series ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', with Curtis playing American millionaire Danny Wilde. The series ran twenty-four episodes.\n\nCurtis is the father of actors [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and [[Kelly Curtis]] by his first wife, actor Janet Leigh.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/2010/09/30/15537731.html| title=Jamie Lee Honours Her Dad| newspaper=Toronto Sun| accessdate=October 1, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001195512/http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/2010/09/30/15537731.html| archive-date=October 1, 2010| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8034695/Tony-Curtis.html| location=London| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph| title=Tony Curtis| date=September 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nTony Curtis was born '''Bernard Schwartz''' on June 3, 1925, at the [[Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital]] on 105th Street in Manhattan, New York City, the first of three boys born to Helen (n\u00e9e Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz.<ref name=a&e>{{cite web| title=Tony Curtis biography| url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Tony-Curtis-9263844| website=Biography.com| accessdate=August 11, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907041843/http://www.biography.com/articles/Tony-Curtis-9263844| archivedate=September 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia| title=Curtis, Tony 1925\u2013| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Tony_Curtis.aspx| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]| accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> \nBiographies have propagated a misconception that he was born in the Bronx, probably due to the family's moves when he was very young, but Tony pointedly corrected this in a TV interview.<ref>{{cite web| title=Interview with cable TV host Skip E Lowe| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmwPhwN0pHA?t=115| accessdate=August 31, 2017}}</ref>\nHis parents were [[Jews|Jewish]] emigrants from [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]]: his father was born in [[\u00d3p\u00e1lyi]], near [[M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka]], and his mother was a native of [[Nagymih\u00e1ly]] (now [[Michalovce]], [[Slovakia]]); she later said she arrived in the U.S. from V\u00e1lyk\u00f3 (now Va\u013ekovo, [[Slovakia]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.slovenskecentrum.sk/sk/news/read/15615/usa-zomrel-americky-herec-tony-curtis-po-matke-slovenskeho-povodu| title=USA: Zomrel americk\u00fd herec Tony Curtis, po matke slovensk\u00e9ho p\u00f4vodu| language=Slovak| trans-title=USA: American actor Tony Curtis died, after a mother of Slovak origin| date=September 30, 2010| agency=[[News Agency of the Slovak Republic]]| website=Slovak Centre London}}</ref><ref name=bet/> He did not learn English until he was five or six, delaying his schooling.<ref name=\"tcmcurtis\"/> His father was a tailor and the family lived in the back of the shop\u2014his parents in one corner and Curtis and his brothers Julius and Robert in another.

His brother Robert was [[Involuntary commitment|institutionalized]] with the same mental illness.\n\nWhen Curtis was eight, he and his brother Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a neighborhood gang whose main crimes were playing truant from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] by sending him to a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended [[Seward Park High School]]. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.<ref name=Lifemag/>\n\n===Military service===\nCurtis enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Inspired by [[Cary Grant]]'s role in ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' and [[Tyrone Power]]'s in ''[[Crash Dive]]'' (1943), he joined the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Pacific submarine force]].<ref name=\"tcmcurtis\">''Private Screenings: Tony Curtis'' [[Turner Classic Movies]], January 19, 1999.</ref> Curtis served aboard a [[submarine tender]], the [[USS Proteus (AS-19)|USS ''Proteus'']]'','' until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Bill]]. He then studied acting at [[The New School]] in [[Greenwich Village]] under the influential German stage director [[Erwin Piscator]]. His contemporaries included [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Bea Arthur|Beatrice Arthur]], and [[Rod Steiger]]. While still at college, Curtis was discovered by [[Joyce Selznick]], the notable [[talent agent]], [[casting director]], and niece of film producer [[David O. Selznick]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1948, Curtis arrived in [[Hollywood]] at age 23. In his autobiography, Curtis described how by chance he met Jack Warner on the plane to California, and also how he briefly dated [[Marilyn Monroe]] before either was famous.\n\n===Universal as \"Anthony Curtis\"===\nUnder contract at [[Universal Pictures]], he changed his name from '''Bernard Schwartz''' to '''Anthony Curtis''' and met unknown actors [[Rock Hudson]], [[James Best]], [[Julie Adams]] and [[Piper Laurie]].<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.com/2012/04/julie-adams-at-85.html| title='Julie Adams at 85'| website=Great Entertainers Archives.com| date=April 9, 2012| first=David| last=Lobosco|  access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> The first name was from the novel ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' and \"Curtis\" was from Kurtz, a surname in his mother's family.<ref name=\"ref091\">{{cite news | last = Rizzo| first = Frank| title = My Interview With Tony Curtis | newspaper = [[Hartford Courant]] | date = October 1, 2009 | access-date = October 1, 2009| url-status=dead| archive-date = July 7, 2012 | url = http://blogs.courant.com/curtain/2009/10/my-interview-with-tony-curtis.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707005014/http://blogs.courant.com/curtain/2009/10/my-interview-with-tony-curtis.html}}</ref> Although Universal Pictures taught him fencing and riding, in keeping with the cinematic themes of the era, Curtis admitted he was at first interested only in girls and money. Neither was he hopeful of his chances of becoming a major star. Curtis's biggest fear was having to return home to the Bronx as a failure:\n\n<blockquote>I was a million-to-one shot, the ''least'' likely to succeed. I wasn't low man on the totem pole, I was ''under'' the totem pole, in a sewer, tied to a sack.<ref name=Lifemag>{{cite journal| title=Tony Curtis in a For\u2013Real Bronx Dream: the Bee\u2013Yoody\u2013Ful Life of a Movie Caliph| first=Shana| last=Alexander| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA160&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false| journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=November 17, 1961| pages=161\u2013176| volume=51| number=20| accessdate=February 25, 2019}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nCurtis's uncredited screen debut came in ''[[Criss Cross (1949 film)|Criss Cross]]'' (1949) playing a [[Rhumba|rumba]] dancer, dancing with [[Yvonne de Carlo]]. The male star was [[Burt Lancaster]] who would make a number of films with Curtis.\n\nIn his second film, ''[[City Across the River]]'' (also in 1949), he was credited as \"Anthony Curtis\".<ref>{{IMDb title|0041251|title=City Across the River}}</ref> He had four lines in ''[[The Lady Gambles]]'' (1949) and a bigger part in ''[[Johnny Stool Pigeon]]'' (1949). He could also be spotted in ''[[Francis (film)|Francis]]'' (1950), ''[[Woman in Hiding]]'' (1950), and ''[[I Was a Shoplifter]]'' (1950).\n\nHe was in three Westerns, ''[[Sierra (film)|Sierra]]'' (1950), starring [[Audie Murphy]], one of many names he worked with (including fellow Universal contractee, [[Rock Hudson]]), ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950), starring [[James Stewart]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. He supported Murphy in another Western, ''[[Kansas Raiders]]'' (1951), playing [[Kit Dalton]]; this time he was billed as \"Tony Curtis\".\n\n===Stardom===\nCurtis was receiving numerous fan letters, so Universal awarded him the starring role in ''[[The Prince Who Was a Thief]]'' (1951), a [[swashbuckler]] set in the Middle East with Piper Laurie. It was a hit at the box office and Curtis was now established.\n\nHe followed it up with ''[[Flesh and Fury]]'' (1952), a boxing movie; ''[[No Room for the Groom]]'' (1952), a comedy with Laurie directed by [[Douglas Sirk]]; and ''[[Son of Ali Baba]]'' (1952), another film set in the Arab world with Laurie.\n\nCurtis then teamed up with then-wife [[Janet Leigh]] in ''[[Houdini (1953 film)|Houdini]]'' (1953), in which Curtis played the title role. His next movies were more \"B\" fare: ''[[All American (film)|All American]]'' (1953), as a footballer; ''[[Forbidden (1953 film)|Forbidden]]'' (1953), as a criminal; ''[[Beachhead (film)|Beachhead]]'' (1954), a war film; ''[[Johnny Dark (film)|Johnny Dark]]'' (1954), with Laurie, as a racing car driver; and ''[[The Black Shield of Falworth]]'' (1954), a medieval swashbuckler with Leigh. The box office performances of these films were solid, and Curtis was growing in popularity.\n\nFor a change of pace he did a musical, ''[[So This Is Paris (1955 film)|So This Is Paris]]'' (1955), then it was back to more typical fare: ''[[Six Bridges to Cross]]'' (1955), as a bank robber; ''[[The Purple Mask]]'' (1955), a swashbuckler; ''[[The Square Jungle]]'' (1955), a boxing film.\n\n===Major star===\nCurtis graduated to more prestigious projects when he was cast in support of [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] in ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956). It was one of the biggest hits of the year.\n\nCurtis made a Western, ''[[The Rawhide Years]]'' (1957); was a gambler in ''[[Mister Cory]]'' (1957); and was a cop in ''[[The Midnight Story]]'' (1957). Lancaster asked for him again, to play scheming press agent Sidney Falco in ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]''  (1957), starring and co-produced by Lancaster. The film was a box office disappointment, but Curtis, for the first time in his career, received sensational reviews.\n\nAnother star-maker was eager to work with him - [[Kirk Douglas]] - in ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958). Janet Leigh also starred, and the resulting movie was a box office hit. Curtis then co-starred with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[Kings Go Forth]]'' (1958), a war story. It was mildly popular, but ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'' (1958), was a bigger success. Curtis gave an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated performance as a bigoted white escaped convict chained to a black man, [[Sidney Poitier]].\n[[File:Monroe and Curtis in Some Like it Hot.JPG|thumb|<center>Curtis with [[Marilyn Monroe]] in<br>''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959)</center>]]\n\nCurtis and Janet Leigh then made a popular comedy for [[Blake Edwards]] at Universal, ''[[The Perfect Furlough]]'' (1958). He co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959). It was a huge success and became a classic; equally popular was ''[[Operation Petticoat]]'' (1959), a military comedy which Curtis made for Edwards alongside [[Cary Grant]].\n\nCurtis and Leigh made one more film together ''[[Who Was That Lady?]]'' (1960), a comedy with [[Dean Martin]]. He and [[Debbie Reynolds]] then starred in ''[[The Rat Race]]'' (1960).\n\nDouglas came calling again, offering Curtis a key role in the former's epic production ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960). It was a huge hit and earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nCurtis then made his first movies in a while without a significant \"name\" co star. Both were biopics: ''[[The Great Impostor]]'' (1961), directed by [[Robert Mulligan]], playing [[Ferdinand Waldo Demara]]; and ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' (1961), where he played war hero [[Ira Hayes]]. He went back to epics with ''[[Taras Bulba (1962 film)|Taras Bulba]]'' (1962), co starring [[Yul Brynner]] and [[Christine Kaufmann]], who soon became Curtis' second wife.\n\n===Comedic roles===\nHe starred with [[Suzanne Pleshette]] in the comedy ''[[40 Pounds of Trouble]]'' (1962), which was a mild hit.\n\nCurtis was one of many stars who had small roles in ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963). He supported [[Gregory Peck]] in ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963) and had an uncredited dual role in ''[[Paris When It Sizzles]]'' (1964). He and Kaufman made their third movie together, the comedy ''[[Wild and Wonderful]]'' (1964). His focus remained on comedies: ''[[Goodbye Charlie]]'' (1964), with Debbie Reynolds; ''[[Sex and the Single Girl (film)|Sex and the Single Girl]]'' (1964), with Natalie Wood; ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965), with Wood and Lemmon for Blake Edwards \u2014 the most expensive comedy film up till that time, but popular; ''[[Boeing Boeing (1965 film)|Boeing Boeing]]'' (1965) a sex farce with [[Jerry Lewis]]; ''[[Not with My Wife, You Don't!]]'' (1966) with [[George C. Scott]]; ''[[Drop Dead Darling]]'' (1966), a British comedy; ''[[Don't Make Waves]]'' (1967), a satire of beach life from director Alexander Mackendrick, with [[Claudia Cardinale]]; and ''[[On My Way to the Crusades, I Met a Girl Who...]]'' (1967), an Italian comedy with [[Monica Vitti]].  In the early 1960s, he was a voice-over guest star on ''[[The Flintstones]]'' as \"Stoney Curtis\".\n\n===''The Boston Strangler''===\nCurtis's first dramatic film after a number of years was ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]'' (1968) playing the title role. Response from the critics and public was excellent. He returned to comedy for ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust!]]'' (1969), an all-star car race film in the vein of ''The Great Race''.\n\nHe made some comic adventure tales: ''[[You Can't Win 'Em All]]'' (1970) with [[Charles Bronson]] and ''[[Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came]]'' (1970).\n\nCurtis decided it was time to turn to television and co-starred with [[Roger Moore]] in the TV series ''[[The Persuaders!]]''.\n\nHe was one of the villains in ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (1975 film)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' (1975) and had the title role in the gangster film ''[[Lepke (film)|Lepke]]'' (1975). Curtis had the lead in a TV series that did not last,  ''[[McCoy (TV series)|McCoy]]'' (1975\u201376). He  was one of many names in ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'' (1976) and had the title role in an Italian comedy ''[[Casanova & Co.]]'' (1977). Later, he co-starred in ''[[Vega$]]'' and was in ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978).\n\n===Later career===\nCurtis supported [[Mae West]] in ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978) and starred in ''[[The Manitou]]'' (1978), a horror film, and ''[[The Bad News Bears Go to Japan]]'' (1978), a comedy. He had good roles in ''[[It Rained All Night the Day I Left]]'' (1980), ''[[Little Miss Marker (1980 film)|Little Miss Marker]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Scarlett O'Hara War]]'' (1980) and was one of many stars in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (1980). On television, he continued to make occasional guest appearances (sometimes playing fictional versions of himself) into the mid-2000s. His final TV series was as host of the documentary-retrospective series (adapting [[Kenneth Anger]]'s [[Hollywood Babylon|book series]]) in 1992-93; each episode would include Curtis recalling some anecdotes from his own career.\n\n===Painter===\nThroughout his life, Curtis enjoyed painting and, since the early 1980s, painted as a second career. His work commands more than $25,000 a canvas now. In the last years of his life, he concentrated on painting rather than movies.

Fortunately, nearly 70 multinational and local brands implemented the monitoring data by The Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) in China, stimulating nearly 8,000 suppliers approaching regulatory violations<ref>How China Can Truly Lead the Fight Against Climate Change https://time.com/5669061/china-climate-change/</ref>.\n\nInternally in the provinces of China, there are various projects held aiming to solve emissions reduction and energy-saving, which is a big step in tackling climate change. Beijing is developing in replacing traditional bulbs with energy-saving light bulbs. Provinces such as Rizhao and Dezhou are promoting solar energy in the building heating system. Besides, Tsinghua University launched a lead on low-carbon city development.

After facing the 2011 smog issue, China's government launched an extensive strategy, which is to improve air quality by reducing the growth of coal consumption. Nevertheless, the trade war that involved China as one of the leading participants has resulted in the loss control of polluting industries, especially in the steel and cement during 2018. Fortunately, nearly 70 multinational and local brands implemented the monitoring data by The Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) in China, stimulating nearly 8,000 suppliers approaching regulatory violations<ref>How China Can Truly Lead the Fight Against Climate Change https://time.com/5669061/china-climate-change/</ref>.\n\nInternally in the provinces of China, there are various projects held aiming to solve emissions reduction and energy-saving, which is a big step in tackling climate change. Beijing is developing in replacing traditional bulbs with energy-saving light bulbs. Provinces such as Rizhao and Dezhou are promoting solar energy in the building heating system. Besides, Tsinghua University launched a lead on low-carbon city development. The city is currently working with Tsinghua University to improve the urban environment by introducing renewable energy into industries and households.<ref>Translating a Global Issue Into Local Priority: China\u2019s Local Government Response to Climate Change   Qi, Y., Ma, L., Zhang, H., & Li, H.

This movie marked the final film appearance of [[Bela Lugosi]]. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by [[Tom Mason]], the [[chiropractic|chiropractor]] of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face.\n\nWood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi {{spaced ndash}} such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died.  Worst of all, Mason may have been the only man in the world who couldn't do an impression of Lugosi's accent. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and [[wikt:kitschy|kitschy]] dialogue.\n\nShot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor.

Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its [[flatulence]] gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'').

This movie marked the final film appearance of [[Bela Lugosi]]. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by [[Tom Mason]], the [[chiropractic|chiropractor]] of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face.\n\nWood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi {{spaced ndash}} such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died.  Worst of all, Mason may have been the only man in the world who couldn't do an impression of Lugosi's accent. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and [[wikt:kitschy|kitschy]] dialogue.\n\nShot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor.

Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its [[flatulence]] gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'').
