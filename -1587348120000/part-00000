"{{Confuse|MIK (character set)}}\n'''Code page 856''' (also known as CP 856 and IBM 00856<ref name=\"IBM\"/>), is a [[code page]] used under [[DOS]] for [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].\n\nLike [[ISO 8859-8]], it encodes only letters, not vowel-points or cantillation marks. As non-localized issues of DOS (except for [[Hebrew MS-DOS]] a.k.a. HDOS) had no inherent [[bi-directional text|bidirectionality]] support, Hebrew text encoded using code page 856 was usually stored in visual order;{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=Text was copied from article about codepage 862. Beyond the question of accuracy it is unclear if the statement applies to codepage 856 at all.}}  nevertheless, a few DOS applications, notably a word processor named EinsteinWriter, stored Hebrew in logical order.\n\nCCSID 9048 added the Euro currency symbol and new sheqel sign, and added direction controls at code points A0 through A6<sub>hex</sub>.<ref name=\"CP856\"/>\n\n==Character set==\nThe following table shows code page 856. Each character is shown with its equivalent [[Unicode]] code point. Only the second half of the table (code points 128\u2013255) is shown, the first half (code points 0\u2013127) being the same as [[code page

The population was 3,038 as of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].\n\nMcSherrystown was home to the headquarters of Teddy Bear manufacturer [[Boyds Bears]] as well as the oldest operating family-run cigar manufacturer in the U.S. (since 1863), F.X. Smith & Sons. Boyds has since closed down, and in 2018, the cigar company was sold.\n \n==History==\nMcSherrystown is the fourth oldest town in Adams County. Its founder, Patrick McSherry (1725\u20131795) having family origins stemming from Newry, Northern Ireland, procured a {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract from the Digges Family in 1763 and proceeded to lay out a number of {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} lots. The first known deed for one of these lots was dated June 27, 1765. Although McSherry may have intended his effort to be used primarily as outlots for Hanover residents, where they could keep their animals at times and obtain wood, it soon developed into a full-fledged town. McSherry, who lived in Mount Pleasant Township in 1765 and was later tavern-keeper in Littlestown, may never have lived in the town which bears his name.<ref>http://www.gettysburg.com/adams200/tidbits/sept.htm</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMcSherrystown is located at {{coord|39|48|15|N|77|1|9|W|type:city}} (39.804202, -77.019301).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1850= 206\n|1860= 280\n|1870= 291\n|1880= 439\n|1890= 1020\n|1900= 1490\n|1910= 1724\n|1920= 1800\n|1930= 2050\n|1940= 2128\n|1950= 2510\n|1960= 2839\n|1970= 2773\n|1980= 2764\n|1990= 2769\n|2000= 2691\n|2010= 3038\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3085\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 2,691 people, 1,175 households, and 727 families residing in the borough.

The population was 3,038 as of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]].\n\nMcSherrystown was home to the headquarters of Teddy Bear manufacturer [[Boyds Bears]] as well as the oldest operating family-run cigar manufacturer in the U.S. (since 1863), F.X. Smith & Sons. Boyds has since closed down, and in 2018, the cigar company was sold.\n \n==History==\nMcSherrystown is the fourth oldest town in Adams County. Its founder, Patrick McSherry (1725\u20131795) having family origins stemming from Newry, Northern Ireland, procured a {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract from the Digges Family in 1763 and proceeded to lay out a number of {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} lots. The first known deed for one of these lots was dated June 27, 1765. Although McSherry may have intended his effort to be used primarily as outlots for Hanover residents, where they could keep their animals at times and obtain wood, it soon developed into a full-fledged town. McSherry, who lived in Mount Pleasant Township in 1765 and was later tavern-keeper in Littlestown, may never have lived in the town which bears his name.<ref>http://www.gettysburg.com/adams200/tidbits/sept.htm</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMcSherrystown is located at {{coord|39|48|15|N|77|1|9|W|type:city}} (39.804202, -77.019301).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1850= 206\n|1860= 280\n|1870= 291\n|1880= 439\n|1890= 1020\n|1900= 1490\n|1910= 1724\n|1920= 1800\n|1930= 2050\n|1940= 2128\n|1950= 2510\n|1960= 2839\n|1970= 2773\n|1980= 2764\n|1990= 2769\n|2000= 2691\n|2010= 3038\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3085\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 2,691 people, 1,175 households, and 727 families residing in the borough.
