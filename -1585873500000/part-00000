B<sub>12</sub> is required by enzymes for two reactions: the conversion of [[methylmalonyl CoA]] to [[succinyl CoA]], and the conversion of [[homocysteine]] to [[methionine]]. In the latter reaction, the [[methyl group]] of [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] is transferred to homocysteine to produce [[tetrahydrofolate]] and methionine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme [[methionine synthase]] with B<sub>12</sub> as an essential cofactor. During B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, this reaction cannot proceed, which leads to the accumulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.

B<sub>12</sub> is required by enzymes for two reactions: the conversion of [[methylmalonyl CoA]] to [[succinyl CoA]], and the conversion of [[homocysteine]] to [[methionine]]. In the latter reaction, the [[methyl group]] of [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] is transferred to homocysteine to produce [[tetrahydrofolate]] and methionine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme [[methionine synthase]] with B<sub>12</sub> as an essential cofactor. During B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, this reaction cannot proceed, which leads to the accumulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This accumulation depletes the other types of folate required for [[purine]] and [[thymidylate]] synthesis, which are required for the synthesis of DNA. Inhibition of [[DNA replication]] in red blood cells results in the formation of large, fragile megaloblastic [[erythrocyte]]s. The neurological aspects of the disease are thought to arise from the accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA due to the requirement of B<sub>12</sub> as a cofactor to the enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase.<ref name=\"pmid16716475\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Oh R, Brown DL | title = Vitamin B12 deficiency. | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 979\u201386 | date = Mar 1, 2003 | pmid = 12643357 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Leary F, Samman S | title = Vitamin B12 in health and disease. | journal = Nutrients | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 299\u2013316 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 22254022 | pmc = 3257642 | doi = 10.3390/nu2030299 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Stover|first=PJ|title=Physiology of folate and vitamin B12 in health and disease.|journal=Nutrition Reviews|date=June 2004|volume=62|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=S3\u201312; discussion S13|pmid=15298442|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2004.tb00070.x}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:GASTRIC PARIETAL CELL ANTIBODIES.jpg|thumb|[[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of gastric parietal cell antibodies on a stomach section]]\nPA may be suspected when a patient's [[blood smear]] shows large, fragile, immature erythrocytes, known as [[megaloblast]]s.

The main result of the war was two centuries of peace with each other.\n\nAll causes of the war had disappeared with the end of the war between Britain and France and the destruction of the power of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to block American expansion into the Northwest. American fears of the Native Americans ended, as did British plans to create a buffer Native American state. The Americans' quest for honor, after their humiliations by the British, was satisfied. The final collapse of the opposition [[Federalist Party]] opened an \"[[Era of Good Feelings]],\" with lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit.\n\nThe British paid little attention to the war since they were preoccupied with their final defeat of [[Napoleon]] in 1815. The Americans failed to gain any territory from [[British North America]], contrary to many American politicians' hopes and expectations, but they managed to gain land from [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alan |date= 2010 |title= The Civil War of 1812 |url= |location= |publisher= Random House |pages=137\u2013139 |isbn=978-0-679-77673-4}}</ref>\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Britain was no longer at war with France, and there were no longer restrictions on trade. The British suspended their policy of [[impressment]] of American sailors as there was no need to resume it. Americans believed that they had regained their honor,<ref>Bradford Perkins, ed. ''The Causes of the War of 1812: National Honor or National Interest?'' (1962)</ref> and they proclaimed victory in what they called a \"second war of independence\" for the decisive defeat of the British invaders at [[New Orleans]] seemed to prove that Britain was not able to regain control of America although that had  \nnot been plausible or even intended by the British at any time during the war.<ref>Hickey p. 300; Barry Schwartz, \"The Social Context of Commemoration: A Study in Collective Memory.\" ''Social Forces'' 61#2 (1982), p. 312 {{JSTOR|2578232}}.</ref> The threat of secession by [[New England]] ended with the failure of the [[Hartford Convention]].\n\nIn Britain, the importance of the conflict was totally overshadowed by European triumphs since Napoleon had returned from exile in March 1815 and was finally defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] 100 days later.\n\n[[Upper Canada]] emerged from the war with a sense of unity and pride as part of the [[British Empire]]. Anglophone Canadians claimed the war as a victory for their freedom from American control, and they credited their militia for the repulse of American invasions. Francophone Canadians largely ignored the war. The Native Americans' westward revolt was weakened.\n\n==Early peace talks==\nEfforts to end the war began in 1812 when the main American diplomat in [[London]] proposed an [[armistice]], in return for a renunciation of impressments, but the British refused. Later in 1812, when the British captured [[Detroit]], and news of the repeal of the Orders reached [[Washington, DC]], Sir [[George Prevost]] arranged an armistice with his counterpart, [[Henry Dearborn]]. The British frigate [[HMS Junon (1810)|HMS ''Junon'']] was sent to relay the Americans' response to the British squadrons on the [[North American Station]]. However, President [[James Madison]] decided to continue the war. In 1813, [[Russia]] offered to mediate a peace, but London rejected the offer for fear of compromising British interests in [[Europe]].<ref>Benn (2002), p. 81.</ref> Finally, Britain and the United States agreed to commence peace negotiations in January 1814.\n\n==Negotiations==\nIn August 1814, peace discussions finally began in the neutral city of [[Ghent]]. Both sides began negotiations with unrealistic demands. The United States wanted an end to all British maritime practices that it deemed objectionable and demanded cessions of Canadian territory and guaranteed fishing rights off [[Newfoundland]]. The British announced< as an essential element of the peace treaty< their longstanding goal of creating a \"neutral\" [[Indian barrier state]], which would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who could use it to block American expansion and to build up British control of the fur trade.<ref>Dwight L. Smith\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2\u20134 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref> London dropped the demand when the Americans adamantly refused it and indicated that they would end negotiations. The British had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813 and no longer controlled adequate supply lines to support a barrier state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis M.

Both sides were tired of the war. Export trade was all but paralyzed, and after Napoleon fell in 1814, France was no longer an enemy of Britain and so the Royal Navy no longer needed either to stop American shipments to France or to have more seamen. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparently-final defeat of Napoleon. The negotiators agreed to return to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', with no changes in boundaries. Both sides signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]] on December 24, 1814. The next and final step would be formal ratification by both governments.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union'' (1992), pp. 94\u2013122.</ref>\n\nThe British but not the Americans knew when they signed that a battle was imminent at [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] (it was fought on January 8, 1815).<ref>Pratt (1955), pp. 135\u20137.</ref> The treaty finally went into effect after it had been formally ratified by both sides in February 1815.\n\nThe treaty failed to secure official British acknowledgment of American maritime rights, but in the century of peace between the world's naval powers from 1815 to [[World War I]], those rights were not seriously violated. The Royal Navy ended the practices that angered Americans since they were no longer needed after Napoleon fell. American pride and honor were built as a result of the Indian threat being ended and by the rejoicing surrounding American victory at New Orleans.<ref>Bertram Wyatt-Brown, \"Andrew Jackson's Honor,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic,'' Vol. 17, No. 1 (Spring, 1997), pp. 1\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3124641 in JSTOR]</ref> In doing so, the United States had successfully created a sense of becoming fully independent from Britain.<ref>Watts (1989)</ref>\n\n==Native Americans==\nA key reason that American frontiersmen were so much in favor of the war in the first place was the threat posed to their continued settlement of territory that was inhabitated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of various tribes. The frontiersmen blamed Native Americans' attacks on the arms and supplies that were provided by British agents in Canada. In addition, the frontiersmen wanted access to lands that the British acknowledged belonged to the United States but were blocking its expansion by inciting and arming the Native Americans. The death of [[Tecumseh]] in battle in 1813 removed a powerful obstacle to expansion although the Native Americans' involvement in the war continued, as did their resistance to American westward expansion after it ended. The Native Americans were the main losers in the war by their loss of British protection and never regained their influence.<ref>Walter R. Borneman, ''1812: The War That Forged a Nation'' (2005), p. 269.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Southeastern United States]], [[Andrew Jackson]]'s destruction of Britain's allies, the [[Creek Indians]], at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814, ended the threat of Native American hostilities in that region. That opened vast areas in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] for settlement as plantations and farmlands. The United States occupied all of [[West Florida]] during the war and, in 1819,  purchased the rest of [[Florida]] from [[Spain]], thus preventing the Spanish from arming hostile tribes there. Creek Indians who escaped to [[Spanish Florida]] joined the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminoles]] there and put up a long resistance, known as the [[Seminole Wars]].<ref>Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2002), pp. 277\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn the Treaty of Ghent, the British promised not to arm the Native Americans in the from Canada or even to trade with them, and the border was largely pacified. However, some Americans assumed that the British had continued to conspire with their former Native American allies in an attempt to forestall American hegemony in the Great Lakes region, but Calloway argued that such perceptions were faulty. After the treaty, the Native Americans in the Great Lakes region became an undesirable burden to British policymakers.<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''Crown and Calumet: British\u2013Indian Relations, 1783\u20131815'' (1987)</ref>\n\n==Canada==\nSome American politicians had mistakenly expected the population of [[Upper Canada]], which was mostly of American origin, to throw off the \"British yoke\", but that did not happen since the reason that many of them were [[United Empire Loyalists]], who has left out of loyalty to Britain. After 1815, British officials, [[Anglican]] clergy, and Loyalists tried to spot and root out American ideals like democracy and republicanism. Thus, the British and Loyalists were able to set the different colonies of what would later become Canada on a course that was different from that of their former enemy. They also discouraged further immigration from the United States.<ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812'' (2010), p. 443.</ref>\n\nWhen the United States attacked British North America, most British forces were engaged in the Napoleonic Wars. Thus, British North America had minimal troops to defend against the United States, which had a much larger military force that was, however, initially poorly trained. For most of the war, British North America stood alone against a much stronger American force. Reinforcements from Britain did not arrive until 1814, the final year of the war. The repelling of the American force helped to foster Loyalism in the colonies that later became Canada.\n\nThe nationalistic sentiment caused suspicion of such American ideas as republicanism, which would frustrate political reform in Upper and Lower Canada until the [[Rebellions of 1837]]. However, the war started the process that ultimately led to [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867. Canadian writer [[Pierre Berton]] wrote that although later events, such as the rebellions and the [[Fenian raids]] of the 1860s were more important, Canada would have become part of the United States if the war had not taken place since more and more American settlers would have arrived and so [[Canadian nationalism]] would not have developed.\n\nThe war was highly significant in Britain's North American colonies. After the war, Canadian supporters of Britain portrayed the war as a successful fight for national survival against an American democratic force that threatened the peace and stability that the Canadians had desired. Throughout the war, most of Canada's inhabitants assigned the war to an American desire to annex the British colonies, a perception that was reinforced by American Ggenerals such as [[William Hull]], who issued proclamations that stated that Canada would be annexed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alan |date= 2010 |title= The Civil War of 1812 |url= |location= |publisher= Random House |pages=137\u2013139 |isbn=978-0-679-77673-4}}</ref>\n\nSome historians have argued that one myth that emerged from the war was that Canadian militiamen played a decisive role during the war and that British officers were often ineffective. [[Jack Granatstein]] has termed that the \"militia myth\" and felt that to have had a deep effect on Canadian military thinking, which placed more stress on a citizens' militia than on a professional standing army. The United States suffered from a similar \"frontiersman myth\" at the start of the war and falsely believed that individual initiative and marksmanship could be effective against a well-disciplined British battle line. Granatstein argued that the militia was not particularly effective in the war and that any British military success was the work of British regular forces and the result of British domination over the sea. [[Isaac Brock]], for example, was reluctant to trust the militia with [[muskets]].<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Canada's army: waging war and keeping the peace'' (2004), p. 4.</ref>\n\nOthers reject that characterization and argue that the [[Canadian militia]] played important roles in several key engagements, including the [[Battle of Chateauguay]], in which they were central to defeating the American advance on [[Montreal]] in the fall of 1813.<ref>http://www.warof1812.ca/lacolle1812.htm</ref><ref>http://www.warof1812.ca/chatgy.htm</ref> Historian Robert Henderson referred to this as \"The myth of the Militia myth\".<ref>Robert Henderson \"The myth of the 'Militia Myth' Dorchester Review (Vol. 3, No. 1 Spring/Summer 2013)</ref>\n\nIn any case, more than 1,600 names of the dead, Canadian (both members of regular units and militia) as well as First Nations Crown allies, are in the Book of Remembrance in the Memorial Chamber in the [[Parliament of Canada]]. Many of them were members of Canadian militia units.<ref>https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/books/history#war1812</ref> See also: [[Canadian Units of the War of 1812]] and [[Books of Remembrance (Canada)]]\n\nDuring the war, British officers constantly worried that the Americans would block the [[St. Lawrence River]], which forms part of the Canada\u2013US border. If that had occurred, there would have been no British supply route for Upper Canada, where most of the land battles took place, and British forces would likely have had to withdraw or to surrender all western British territory within a few months. British officers' dispatches after the war exhibited astonishment that the Americans never took such a simple step, but the British were not willing to count on the enemy repeating the mistake and so they commissioned the [[Rideau Canal]], an expensive project that connects [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], on [[Lake Ontario]], to the [[Ottawa River]], providing an alternative supply route to bypass the part of the St. Lawrence River along the border. The settlement at the northeastern end of the canal, where it joins the Ottawa River, later became the city of [[Ottawa]], Canada's fourth-largest city and its capital, which was placed inland to protect it from an American invasion and was then known as the \"defensible back-country.\" Because the population far from the St. Lawrence shores was negligible, the British, in the years following the war, took great lengths to ensure that back-country settlement was increased. They settled soldiers and initiated assisted-immigration schemes, offering free land to farmers, mostly tenants of estates in the south of [[Ireland]]. The canal project was not completed until 1832 and never used for its intended purpose.<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Canada's army: waging war and keeping the peace'' (2004), p. 15.</ref>\n\n==Britain==\nIn contrast to Canada, the War of 1812 is seldom remembered in Britain today, and the conflict was quickly forgotten by the British public, chiefly because it was overshadowed by the dramatic events of the contemporary [[Napoleonic Wars]] and because Britain neither gained nor lost anything by the peace settlement; all it did was to keep its control of Canada.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009), pp. 221\u201332.</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] was acutely conscious that the \nUnited States Navy had won single-ship duels during the war even though they had no strategic effect. Particular attention was given those battles because American propaganda had projected them as battles of equal force; however, the only single-ship duel in which the forces were equal was the [[Battle of Boston Harbor]], which the British won. Furthermore, the British had effectively won the war on the ocean since almost the entire American Navy was blockaded and so was unable to fight. British honor was restored when USS ''President''  was [[Capture of USS President|captured]] and taken to Britain so that all could see that the American ships that supposedly participated in battles of so-called equal force were actually much larger than the British ships that they engaged.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\nAmerican privateers and commerce raiders had captured approximately 1,200 British merchant ships, sending insurance rates up and embarrassing the Admiralty. Nevertheless, 50% of all American privateers were captured by the British although the privateers captured only 5% to 7% of British commerce. Meanwhile, for every 14 American merchant ships that traded before the start of the war, only 1 ship dared to leave port during the war, despite the Americans' effort to double their maritime trade. Furthermore, of the few ships that left port, a total of 1,400 were captured. In addition, Britain actually won  many sea battles. The Royal Navy had been able to deploy overwhelming strength to American waters, which had the effect to annihilate, rather than merely dent, American maritime trade, and it drove the American economy close to bankruptcy. The Royal Navy would emerge unchecked from the conflict.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\nThe [[British Army]] regarded the 1812\u20131815 conflict in Canada and America as a sideshow. Only one regiment, the 41st, was awarded a battle honor (Detroit) from the war. The British Army was more interested in the lessons of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain. The Battle of New Orleans could be conveniently attributed to poor leadership or to insuperable physical obstacles, and British attention was given to the Royal Navy's successful capture of the American flagship, which the Americans conveniently overlooked.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref> It was believed that if its generalship had been better, the British would have been successful at New Orleans. The huge, overwhelming success and the pre-eminence of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in Europe, the British Army would make no change to its systems of recruitment, discipline and awards of commissions for more than half a century.\n\nThe British suffered 10,000 fatalities in the war, 1,960 of them in combat.\n\n==United States==\nThe gloom in [[New England]], which staunchly opposed the war, culminated in December 1814, as delegates from five states met secretly in the [[Hartford Convention]], which demanded constitutional amendments to protect New England's interests against the West and the South. Talk of secession was rife, and the region might have threatened to secede from the Union if its demands had been ignored, but news of peace ended the movement.\n\nThe United States had faced near-disaster in 1814, but the victories at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] and the [[Battle of Baltimore]] and what seemed to be a successful fight against the Britain increased to unite the Americans into one nation. Meanwhile, the loss of the American flagship {{USS|President|1800|6}} was conveniently overlooked by the public. The best-known patriotic legacy of the war was \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The words are by [[Francis Scott Key]], who, after the bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]], set them to the music of a British drinking song, \"To Anacreon in Heaven.\" In 1889, the United States Navy began using \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at flag-raising ceremonies, a practice that was copied by the Army. In 1931, Congress made it the [[American national anthem]].<ref>Benn, p. 84.</ref>\n\nAlthough its original objectives of the war had all failed, the [[American people]] saw the War of 1812 as evidence of the success of the democratic experiment. The war ushered in a period of American history that has frequently been called \"the [[Era of Good Feelings]],\" and, at least on the surface, most Americans felt unified behind a common purpose. The war convinced the country that it could fend off any foreign threats and that its focus should be on expansion at home.\n\nWith the collapse of the Hartford Convention and news of the triumph at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], Americans had cause for celebration. In February, President [[James Madison]] sent Congress the peace treaty, the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. He congratulated the nation on the close of a war \"waged with the success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the public spirit of the militia, and of the valor of the military and naval forces of the country.\" The spirit of nationalism and pride led to the collapse of the antiwar Federalist Party and the new Era of Good Feelings.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952), ch. 1.</ref>\n\nOne indirect result of the War of 1812 was the later election to the presidency of war heroes [[Andrew Jackson]] and later [[William Henry Harrison]]. Both men won military fame, which had much to do with their elections. Another indirect result was the decline of the power of the Federalist Party.\n\n===American military===\nDuring the war, roughly 15,000 American soldiers and sailors died, 3,721 in combat. The war cost the United States about $200 million. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom gained any military advantage although indirectly, the United States made some gains.<ref>\"War of 1812\". (2006). ''Compton's by Britannica''.

The new professionalism would become apparent during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848). After the [[Texas Annexation]] by the United States, the term [[Manifest Destiny]] became a widely-used political term for those who propagated American expansionism and military pride.<ref>Weigley (1973)</ref>\n\nIn a related development, the United States officially abandoned its reliance on the militia for its defense. Moreover, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], which then controlled West Point, began building fortifications around [[New Orleans]] as a response to the British attack on the city during the war. That effort then grew into numerous civil river works, especially in the 1840s and the 1850s under General [[Pierre Beauregard]]. The Corps remains the authority over works on the [[Mississippi River]] and other rivers.\n\nThe embarrassing defeat of [[Fort Madison]], in what is now [[Iowa]], and [[Fort McKay]], in [[Prairie du Chien]], led to the fortification of the Mississippi, with the expansion of [[Fort Belle Fontaine]], near [[St. Louis]], and the construction of [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] (1816) and Fort Edwards (1816), in [[Illinois]]; [[Fort Crawford]] (1816), in Prairie du Chien; and [[Fort Snelling]] (1819) in Minnesota. Removal of all Indians from the Mississippi Valley became a top priority for the American government.<ref>Prucha, Francis P. (1969).

For the next century, it was often called \"the Second American War for Independence,\" and it propelled [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] to the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Andrew Robertson|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H-iCQAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA372|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=372|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781604266474}}</ref> Americans felt they had restored their sense of honor. \n: National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake...

In 1811, the [[Little Belt Affair|''Little Belt'' Affair]] would anger the Admiralty and embarrass the United States and lead to the British having a particular interest in capturing the American flagship {{USS|President|1800|6}}. Although the British would effectively disable the vast majority of the [[US Navy]] during the war by having the ships blockaded, the single-ship actions won by the Americans won embarrassed the British Admiralty. Specific attention was given to those battles since the Americans claimed that they were between ships of equal force.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\nThe British effectively restored their honor by capturing the sloop of war {{USS|Frolic|1813|6}} and, more importantly, the flagship USS ''President''. Both ships were taken to Britain for all to see that the American ships of the so-called engagements of equal force were much larger than the British ships that they had fought in single-ship duels. Furthermore, the United States failed at abolishing impressment when the treaty was signed, but the British did not continue the practice; the Napoleonic Wars had ended and so the British no longer needed as many sailors. In doing so, British honor was restored, only for the entire conflict to be overshadowed by the defeat of Napoleon.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\n==Economic impact==\nAlthough the War of 1812 severely damaged the American economy because of the British blockade, the aftermath gave a dramatic boost to American manufacturing capabilities . The British blockade of the American coast created a shortage of cotton cloth, leading the Americans to create a cotton-manufacturing industry, beginning at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]]. The war also spurred on the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], a project that was built to promote commercial links but also was perceived to have military uses if the need ever arose.<ref>Stanley Engerman and Robert E. Gallman, eds. ''The Cambridge economic history of the United States: the colonial era: Volume 1'' (2000), p. 372.</ref>\n\nAs the charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]] had been allowed to expire in 1811, the federal government was ill-prepared to finance the war and so resorted to such expediencies as the suspension of [[hard money (policy)|specie payment]] and the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)#War of 1812|Treasury Notes]]. Those actions set a precedent for future federal responses to financial crises. Also, the exposure of the nation's financial weaknesses partly explained the decision for Congress to charter the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in 1816. The readiness of Southern leaders, especially [[John C. Calhoun]], to support such a measure also indicates a high degree of national feeling.<ref>Wiltse (1944)</ref> Perhaps the clearest sign of a new sense of national unity was the victorious [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], with its longtime foes, the Federalists, vanishing from national politics.

American fears of the Native Americans ended, as did British plans to create a buffer Native American state. The Americans' quest for honor, after their humiliations by the British, was satisfied. The final collapse of the opposition [[Federalist Party]] opened an \"[[Era of Good Feelings]],\" with lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit.\n\nThe British paid little attention to the war since they were preoccupied with their final defeat of [[Napoleon]] in 1815. The Americans failed to gain any territory from [[British North America]], contrary to many American politicians' hopes and expectations, but they managed to gain land from [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alan |date= 2010 |title= The Civil War of 1812 |url= |location= |publisher= Random House |pages=137\u2013139 |isbn=978-0-679-77673-4}}</ref>\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Britain was no longer at war with France, and there were no longer restrictions on trade. The British suspended their policy of [[impressment]] of American sailors as there was no need to resume it. Americans believed that they had regained their honor,<ref>Bradford Perkins, ed. ''The Causes of the War of 1812: National Honor or National Interest?'' (1962)</ref> and they proclaimed victory in what they called a \"second war of independence\" for the decisive defeat of the British invaders at [[New Orleans]] seemed to prove that Britain was not able to regain control of America although that had  \nnot been plausible or even intended by the British at any time during the war.<ref>Hickey p. 300; Barry Schwartz, \"The Social Context of Commemoration: A Study in Collective Memory.\" ''Social Forces'' 61#2 (1982), p. 312 {{JSTOR|2578232}}.</ref> The threat of secession by [[New England]] ended with the failure of the [[Hartford Convention]].\n\nIn Britain, the importance of the conflict was totally overshadowed by European triumphs since Napoleon had returned from exile in March 1815 and was finally defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] 100 days later.\n\n[[Upper Canada]] emerged from the war with a sense of unity and pride as part of the [[British Empire]]. Anglophone Canadians claimed the war as a victory for their freedom from American control, and they credited their militia for the repulse of American invasions. Francophone Canadians largely ignored the war. The Native Americans' westward revolt was weakened.\n\n==Early peace talks==\nEfforts to end the war began in 1812 when the main American diplomat in [[London]] proposed an [[armistice]], in return for a renunciation of impressments, but the British refused. Later in 1812, when the British captured [[Detroit]], and news of the repeal of the Orders reached [[Washington, DC]], Sir [[George Prevost]] arranged an armistice with his counterpart, [[Henry Dearborn]]. The British frigate [[HMS Junon (1810)|HMS ''Junon'']] was sent to relay the Americans' response to the British squadrons on the [[North American Station]]. However, President [[James Madison]] decided to continue the war. In 1813, [[Russia]] offered to mediate a peace, but London rejected the offer for fear of compromising British interests in [[Europe]].<ref>Benn (2002), p. 81.</ref> Finally, Britain and the United States agreed to commence peace negotiations in January 1814.\n\n==Negotiations==\nIn August 1814, peace discussions finally began in the neutral city of [[Ghent]]. Both sides began negotiations with unrealistic demands. The United States wanted an end to all British maritime practices that it deemed objectionable and demanded cessions of Canadian territory and guaranteed fishing rights off [[Newfoundland]]. The British announced< as an essential element of the peace treaty< their longstanding goal of creating a \"neutral\" [[Indian barrier state]], which would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who could use it to block American expansion and to build up British control of the fur trade.<ref>Dwight L. Smith\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2\u20134 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref> London dropped the demand when the Americans adamantly refused it and indicated that they would end negotiations. The British had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813 and no longer controlled adequate supply lines to support a barrier state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Francis M.

Both sides were tired of the war. Export trade was all but paralyzed, and after Napoleon fell in 1814, France was no longer an enemy of Britain and so the Royal Navy no longer needed either to stop American shipments to France or to have more seamen. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparently-final defeat of Napoleon. The negotiators agreed to return to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', with no changes in boundaries. Both sides signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]] on December 24, 1814. The next and final step would be formal ratification by both governments.<ref>Robert V. Remini, ''Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union'' (1992), pp. 94\u2013122.</ref>\n\nThe British but not the Americans knew when they signed that a battle was imminent at [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] (it was fought on January 8, 1815).<ref>Pratt (1955), pp. 135\u20137.</ref> The treaty finally went into effect after it had been formally ratified by both sides in February 1815.\n\nThe treaty failed to secure official British acknowledgment of American maritime rights, but in the century of peace between the world's naval powers from 1815 to [[World War I]], those rights were not seriously violated. The Royal Navy ended the practices that angered Americans since they were no longer needed after Napoleon fell. American pride and honor were built as a result of the Indian threat being ended and by the rejoicing surrounding American victory at New Orleans.<ref>Bertram Wyatt-Brown, \"Andrew Jackson's Honor,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic,'' Vol. 17, No. 1 (Spring, 1997), pp. 1\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3124641 in JSTOR]</ref> In doing so, the United States had successfully created a sense of becoming fully independent from Britain.<ref>Watts (1989)</ref>\n\n==Native Americans==\nA key reason that American frontiersmen were so much in favor of the war in the first place was the threat posed to their continued settlement of territory that was inhabitated by [[Native Americans]] of various tribes. The frontiersmen blamed Native Americans' attacks on the arms and supplies that were provided by British agents in Canada. In addition, the frontiersmen wanted access to lands that the British acknowledged belonged to the United States but were blocking its expansion by inciting and arming the Native Americans. The death of [[Tecumseh]] in battle in 1813 removed a powerful obstacle to expansion although the Native Americans' involvement in the war continued, as did their resistance to American westward expansion after it ended. The Native Americans were the main losers in the war by their loss of British protection and never regained their influence.<ref>Walter R. Borneman, ''1812: The War That Forged a Nation'' (2005), p. 269.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Southeastern United States]], [[Andrew Jackson]]'s destruction of Britain's allies, the [[Creek Indians]], at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814, ended the threat of Native American hostilities in that region. That opened vast areas in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] for settlement as plantations and farmlands. The United States occupied all of [[West Florida]] during the war and, in 1819,  purchased the rest of [[Florida]] from [[Spain]], thus preventing the Spanish from arming hostile tribes there. Creek Indians who escaped to [[Spanish Florida]] joined the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminoles]] there and put up a long resistance, known as the [[Seminole Wars]].<ref>Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and His Indian Wars'' (2002), pp. 277\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn the Treaty of Ghent, the British promised not to arm the Native Americans in the from Canada or even to trade with them, and the border was largely pacified. However, some Americans assumed that the British had continued to conspire with their former Native American allies in an attempt to forestall American hegemony in the Great Lakes region, but Calloway argued that such perceptions were faulty. After the treaty, the Native Americans in the Great Lakes region became an undesirable burden to British policymakers.<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''Crown and Calumet: British\u2013Indian Relations, 1783\u20131815'' (1987)</ref>\n\n==Canada==\nSome American politicians had mistakenly expected the population of [[Upper Canada]], which was mostly of American origin, to throw off the \"British yoke\", but that did not happen since the reason that many of them were [[United Empire Loyalists]], who has left out of loyalty to Britain. After 1815, British officials, [[Anglican]] clergy, and Loyalists tried to spot and root out American ideals like democracy and republicanism. Thus, the British and Loyalists were able to set the different colonies of what would later become Canada on a course that was different from that of their former enemy. They also discouraged further immigration from the United States.<ref>Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812'' (2010), p. 443.</ref>\n\nWhen the United States attacked British North America, most British forces were engaged in the Napoleonic Wars. Thus, British North America had minimal troops to defend against the United States, which had a much larger military force that was, however, initially poorly trained. For most of the war, British North America stood alone against a much stronger American force. Reinforcements from Britain did not arrive until 1814, the final year of the war. The repelling of the American force helped to foster Loyalism in the colonies that later became Canada.\n\nThe nationalistic sentiment caused suspicion of such American ideas as republicanism, which would frustrate political reform in Upper and Lower Canada until the [[Rebellions of 1837]]. However, the war started the process that ultimately led to [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867. Canadian writer [[Pierre Berton]] wrote that although later events, such as the rebellions and the [[Fenian raids]] of the 1860s were more important, Canada would have become part of the United States if the war had not taken place since more and more American settlers would have arrived and so [[Canadian nationalism]] would not have developed.\n\nThe war was highly significant in Britain's North American colonies. After the war, Canadian supporters of Britain portrayed the war as a successful fight for national survival against an American democratic force that threatened the peace and stability that the Canadians had desired. Throughout the war, most of Canada's inhabitants assigned the war to an American desire to annex the British colonies, a perception that was reinforced by American Ggenerals such as [[William Hull]], who issued proclamations that stated that Canada would be annexed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Alan |date= 2010 |title= The Civil War of 1812 |url= |location= |publisher= Random House |pages=137\u2013139 |isbn=978-0-679-77673-4}}</ref>\n\nSome historians have argued that one myth that emerged from the war was that Canadian militiamen played a decisive role during the war and that British officers were often ineffective. [[Jack Granatstein]] has termed that the \"militia myth\" and felt that to have had a deep effect on Canadian military thinking, which placed more stress on a citizens' militia than on a professional standing army. The United States suffered from a similar \"frontiersman myth\" at the start of the war and falsely believed that individual initiative and marksmanship could be effective against a well-disciplined British battle line. Granatstein argued that the militia was not particularly effective in the war and that any British military success was the work of British regular forces and the result of British domination over the sea. [[Isaac Brock]], for example, was reluctant to trust the militia with [[muskets]].<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Canada's army: waging war and keeping the peace'' (2004), p. 4.</ref>\n\nOthers reject that characterization and argue that the [[Canadian militia]] played important roles in several key engagements, including the [[Battle of Chateauguay]], in which they were central to defeating the American advance on [[Montreal]] in the fall of 1813.<ref>http://www.warof1812.ca/lacolle1812.htm</ref><ref>http://www.warof1812.ca/chatgy.htm</ref> Historian Robert Henderson referred to this as \"The myth of the Militia myth\".<ref>Robert Henderson \"The myth of the 'Militia Myth' Dorchester Review (Vol. 3, No. 1 Spring/Summer 2013)</ref>\n\nIn any case, more than 1,600 names of the dead, Canadian (both members of regular units and militia) as well as First Nations Crown allies, are in the Book of Remembrance in the Memorial Chamber in the [[Parliament of Canada]]. Many of them were members of Canadian militia units.<ref>https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/books/history#war1812</ref> See also: [[Canadian Units of the War of 1812]] and [[Books of Remembrance (Canada)]]\n\nDuring the war, British officers constantly worried that the Americans would block the [[St. Lawrence River]], which forms part of the Canada\u2013US border. If that had occurred, there would have been no British supply route for Upper Canada, where most of the land battles took place, and British forces would likely have had to withdraw or to surrender all western British territory within a few months. British officers' dispatches after the war exhibited astonishment that the Americans never took such a simple step, but the British were not willing to count on the enemy repeating the mistake and so they commissioned the [[Rideau Canal]], an expensive project that connects [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], on [[Lake Ontario]], to the [[Ottawa River]], providing an alternative supply route to bypass the part of the St. Lawrence River along the border. The settlement at the northeastern end of the canal, where it joins the Ottawa River, later became the city of [[Ottawa]], Canada's fourth-largest city and its capital, which was placed inland to protect it from an American invasion and was then known as the \"defensible back-country.\" Because the population far from the St. Lawrence shores was negligible, the British, in the years following the war, took great lengths to ensure that back-country settlement was increased. They settled soldiers and initiated assisted-immigration schemes, offering free land to farmers, mostly tenants of estates in the south of [[Ireland]]. The canal project was not completed until 1832 and never used for its intended purpose.<ref>J. L. Granatstein, ''Canada's army: waging war and keeping the peace'' (2004), p. 15.</ref>\n\n==Britain==\nIn contrast to Canada, the War of 1812 is seldom remembered in Britain today, and the conflict was quickly forgotten by the British public, chiefly because it was overshadowed by the dramatic events of the contemporary [[Napoleonic Wars]] and because Britain neither gained nor lost anything by the peace settlement; all it did was to keep its control of Canada.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009), pp. 221\u201332.</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] was acutely conscious that the \nUnited States Navy had won single-ship duels during the war even though they had no strategic effect. Particular attention was given those battles because American propaganda had projected them as battles of equal force; however, the only single-ship duel in which the forces were equal was the [[Battle of Boston Harbor]], which the British won. Furthermore, the British had effectively won the war on the ocean since almost the entire American Navy was blockaded and so was unable to fight. British honor was restored when USS ''President''  was [[Capture of USS President|captured]] and taken to Britain so that all could see that the American ships that supposedly participated in battles of so-called equal force were actually much larger than the British ships that they engaged.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\nAmerican privateers and commerce raiders had captured approximately 1,200 British merchant ships, sending insurance rates up and embarrassing the Admiralty. Nevertheless, 50% of all American privateers were captured by the British although the privateers captured only 5% to 7% of British commerce. Meanwhile, for every 14 American merchant ships that traded before the start of the war, only 1 ship dared to leave port during the war, despite the Americans' effort to double their maritime trade. Furthermore, of the few ships that left port, a total of 1,400 were captured. In addition, Britain actually won  many sea battles. The Royal Navy had been able to deploy overwhelming strength to American waters, which had the effect to annihilate, rather than merely dent, American maritime trade, and it drove the American economy close to bankruptcy. The Royal Navy would emerge unchecked from the conflict.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\nThe [[British Army]] regarded the 1812\u20131815 conflict in Canada and America as a sideshow. Only one regiment, the 41st, was awarded a battle honor (Detroit) from the war. The British Army was more interested in the lessons of the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain. The Battle of New Orleans could be conveniently attributed to poor leadership or to insuperable physical obstacles, and British attention was given to the Royal Navy's successful capture of the American flagship, which the Americans conveniently overlooked.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref> It was believed that if its generalship had been better, the British would have been successful at New Orleans. The huge, overwhelming success and the pre-eminence of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in Europe, the British Army would make no change to its systems of recruitment, discipline and awards of commissions for more than half a century.\n\nThe British suffered 10,000 fatalities in the war, 1,960 of them in combat.\n\n==United States==\nThe gloom in [[New England]], which staunchly opposed the war, culminated in December 1814, as delegates from five states met secretly in the [[Hartford Convention]], which demanded constitutional amendments to protect New England's interests against the West and the South. Talk of secession was rife, and the region might have threatened to secede from the Union if its demands had been ignored, but news of peace ended the movement.\n\nThe United States had faced near-disaster in 1814, but the victories at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] and the [[Battle of Baltimore]] and what seemed to be a successful fight against the Britain increased to unite the Americans into one nation. Meanwhile, the loss of the American flagship {{USS|President|1800|6}} was conveniently overlooked by the public. The best-known patriotic legacy of the war was \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The words are by [[Francis Scott Key]], who, after the bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]], set them to the music of a British drinking song, \"To Anacreon in Heaven.\" In 1889, the United States Navy began using \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at flag-raising ceremonies, a practice that was copied by the Army. In 1931, Congress made it the [[American national anthem]].<ref>Benn, p. 84.</ref>\n\nAlthough its original objectives of the war had all failed, the [[American people]] saw the War of 1812 as evidence of the success of the democratic experiment. The war ushered in a period of American history that has frequently been called \"the [[Era of Good Feelings]],\" and, at least on the surface, most Americans felt unified behind a common purpose. The war convinced the country that it could fend off any foreign threats and that its focus should be on expansion at home.\n\nWith the collapse of the Hartford Convention and news of the triumph at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], Americans had cause for celebration. In February, President [[James Madison]] sent Congress the peace treaty, the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. He congratulated the nation on the close of a war \"waged with the success which is the natural result of the wisdom of the legislative councils, of the patriotism of the people, of the public spirit of the militia, and of the valor of the military and naval forces of the country.\" The spirit of nationalism and pride led to the collapse of the antiwar Federalist Party and the new Era of Good Feelings.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952), ch. 1.</ref>\n\nOne indirect result of the War of 1812 was the later election to the presidency of war heroes [[Andrew Jackson]] and later [[William Henry Harrison]]. Both men won military fame, which had much to do with their elections. Another indirect result was the decline of the power of the Federalist Party.\n\n===American military===\nDuring the war, roughly 15,000 American soldiers and sailors died, 3,721 in combat. The war cost the United States about $200 million. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom gained any military advantage although indirectly, the United States made some gains.<ref>\"War of 1812\". (2006). ''Compton's by Britannica''.

The new professionalism would become apparent during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848). After the [[Texas Annexation]] by the United States, the term [[Manifest Destiny]] became a widely-used political term for those who propagated American expansionism and military pride.<ref>Weigley (1973)</ref>\n\nIn a related development, the United States officially abandoned its reliance on the militia for its defense. Moreover, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], which then controlled West Point, began building fortifications around [[New Orleans]] as a response to the British attack on the city during the war. That effort then grew into numerous civil river works, especially in the 1840s and the 1850s under General [[Pierre Beauregard]]. The Corps remains the authority over works on the [[Mississippi River]] and other rivers.\n\nThe embarrassing defeat of [[Fort Madison]], in what is now [[Iowa]], and [[Fort McKay]], in [[Prairie du Chien]], led to the fortification of the Mississippi, with the expansion of [[Fort Belle Fontaine]], near [[St. Louis]], and the construction of [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] (1816) and Fort Edwards (1816), in [[Illinois]]; [[Fort Crawford]] (1816), in Prairie du Chien; and [[Fort Snelling]] (1819) in Minnesota. Removal of all Indians from the Mississippi Valley became a top priority for the American government.<ref>Prucha, Francis P. (1969).

In 1811, the [[Little Belt Affair|''Little Belt'' Affair]] would anger the Admiralty and embarrass the United States and lead to the British having a particular interest in capturing the American flagship {{USS|President|1800|6}}. Although the British would effectively disable the vast majority of the [[US Navy]] during the war by having the ships blockaded, the single-ship actions won by the Americans won embarrassed the British Admiralty. Specific attention was given to those battles since the Americans claimed that they were between ships of equal force.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\nThe British effectively restored their honor by capturing the sloop of war {{USS|Frolic|1813|6}} and, more importantly, the flagship USS ''President''. Both ships were taken to Britain for all to see that the American ships of the so-called engagements of equal force were much larger than the British ships that they had fought in single-ship duels. Furthermore, the United States failed at abolishing impressment when the treaty was signed, but the British did not continue the practice; the Napoleonic Wars had ended and so the British no longer needed as many sailors. In doing so, British honor was restored, only for the entire conflict to be overshadowed by the defeat of Napoleon.<ref>Lambert, Andrew: The Challenge: Britain against America in The War of 1812, Kindle edition</ref>\n\n==Economic impact==\nAlthough the War of 1812 severely damaged the American economy because of the British blockade, the aftermath gave a dramatic boost to American manufacturing capabilities . The British blockade of the American coast created a shortage of cotton cloth, leading the Americans to create a cotton-manufacturing industry, beginning at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]]. The war also spurred on the construction of the [[Erie Canal]], a project that was built to promote commercial links but also was perceived to have military uses if the need ever arose.<ref>Stanley Engerman and Robert E. Gallman, eds. ''The Cambridge economic history of the United States: the colonial era: Volume 1'' (2000), p. 372.</ref>\n\nAs the charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]] had been allowed to expire in 1811, the federal government was ill-prepared to finance the war and so resorted to such expediencies as the suspension of [[hard money (policy)|specie payment]] and the issuance of [[Treasury Note (19th century)#War of 1812|Treasury Notes]]. Those actions set a precedent for future federal responses to financial crises. Also, the exposure of the nation's financial weaknesses partly explained the decision for Congress to charter the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in 1816. The readiness of Southern leaders, especially [[John C. Calhoun]], to support such a measure also indicates a high degree of national feeling.<ref>Wiltse (1944)</ref> Perhaps the clearest sign of a new sense of national unity was the victorious [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], with its longtime foes, the Federalists, vanishing from national politics. The result was an [[Era of Good Feelings]], with the lowest level of partisanship ever seen.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Awakening of American Nationalism, 1815\u20131828'' (1966), ch. 1.</ref>\n\nCanadians, however, contrasted their postwar economic stagnation to the booming American economy, which Desmond Morton believed to have led to the [[Rebellions of 1837]].<ref>Desmond Morton, ''A Military History of Canada'' (2007), p. 71.</ref> During the war, [[Bermudian|Bermuda]] privateers, with their fast [[Bermuda sloop]]s, were to capture 298 ships (the total captures by all British naval or privateering vessels between the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[West Indies]] was 1,593 vessels).<ref>Walter Brownell Hayward, ''Bermuda past and present'' (1910), pp. 58\u201366.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chronology of the War of 1812]]\n*[[Origins of the War of 1812]]\n*[[War of 1812]]\n*[[Treaty of Ghent]]\n*[[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{further|List of books about the War of 1812}}\n* Berton, Pierre; ''The Invasion of Canada: 1812\u20131813'' (1980). {{ISBN|0-7710-1244-6}}; ''Flames Across the Border: 1813\u20131814'' (1981); reissued as ''Pierre Berton's War of 1812'' (Toronto: Anchor Canada, 2011); popular Canadian narrative; 928pp\n*Bickham, Troy, ''The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, The British Empire, and the War of 1812'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) {{ISBN|978-0195391787}}\n* Black, Jeremy.

Based on the original BBC children's Saturday morning show ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]'', which ran on [[BBC One]] from 1976 to 1982, it was hosted by [[Barney Harwood]], along with veteran puppet character [[Basil Brush]], from whom the show takes its title.\n\n==New format==\nThe new version of ''Swap Shop'' was [[live television|broadcast live]], and featured games and comedy sketches, as well as the \"swap shop\" itself (the studio audience brought items to exchange for this feature). Unlike the original series, this new format regularly features gungings for those taking part in the games. A total of three series were produced. In series 3, the name of the programme was changed to ''Basil and Barney's Swap Shop''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Series 1===\nThe first series ran for thirteen episodes of one hour. In addition to main presenters Basil Brush and Barney Harwood, [[Melvin Odoom]] (ex regular of ''[[Dick and Dom In Da Bungalow]]'' and regular of ''[[The Slammer]]'') was a featured performer who took a central role in many of the comedy sketches and games. Celebrity guests included [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]] and [[Joe Pasquale]].\n\nSeries one of Basil's Swap Shop featured gungey games. \"Question Line\", a game where children ask the celebrity guest questions and if the celebrity chooses to answer it the child doesn\u2019t get gunged. If however, the celebrity chooses not to answer the question the child asking the question slides into the gunge tank (a pool of gunge similar to the one on Waaa!!!). The children move as they are sitting in or lying across a rubber ring on a ramp with their legs hanging out on the \"gungeulator\" a red and white travelator. If the child does slide into the gunge tank then they have to move over and sit in the gunge tank until the game is over. Another game called Dunk Beds, is where there are 3 teams of 2 children, 1 is on a bed attached to a platform and the other child is off the bed. The child off the bed pushes the bed off along the platform, where along the platform are scoring zones. Up to a point, the points are negative then past a certain point, the points become positive until finally off the scale. If the bed goes off the scale the child on the end of the bed slides into a tank of green coloured water. 0 points are awarded if the child gets dunked. Each child from each team is on the bed once during the duration of the game. In the final Game, the final 2 children, left over from the previous game, play on a moving platform called the gungeulator collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, to get them back to the start of the \"gungeulator\". If a child falls then he/she is automatically gunged and the child that is left continues the game. However, if the child left wins then prizes are awarded to both the children but if both children are gunged the game is over and no prized are awarded. Whilst playing these games the children are barefoot except the final game where the children are dressed in fat suits wearing trainers on a moving platform\n\n===Series 2===\nSeries Two began without Melvin O'Doom on the presenting team. However, the show did feature a new comedy character, Ugly Yeti. The first two episodes did not have Basil live in the studio as he was ill in hospital.  The amount of live swaps was reduced from 10 to 5 and popular sketch Zeroes did not return. Celebrity guests included [[Tom Daley (diver)|Tom Daley]]. Team Sam & Lewis were proven to be the best when they made it to the final in Series 2. The credits for the show list Ugly Yeti as being played by Marcus Garvey. This was rumoured to be a reference to Rastafarian leader [[Marcus Garvey]], since some early reggae is played as background music on the show. The \"question line\" and \"gungeulator\" segments no longer featured. The \"Gunge Gallery\" along with a tweaked \"dunk beds\" featured instead. The \"Gunge Gallery\" is five gunge tanks in a row in which children (members of a karate club, football team etc.)\n\n===Series 3===\nMarcus Garvey returned to play Ugly Yeti and the name had been changed to ''Basil and Barney's Swap Shop'', not to forget the studio set refurbished. Dunk Beds and Yettis In Space returned, and 'Gold Brush Gold Rush' became the second game during the show. 'Gold Brush Gold Brush' is set in a western style town and the two teams have to power a conveyor belt with buckets of gunge up to a holder - the team who fills their holder goes through to the next game. This series saw host Barney Harwood absent for a few editions for some unknown reasons. [[Johny Pitts]] (of CBBC's [[Roar (UK TV series)|Roar]] and [[Help! Teach is Coming to Stay]]) was the official guest presenter filling in for Barney. Marcus Garvey who plays the Ugly Yeti had often been absence too. Special features in the series included 'Britain's Swaps Talent' where presenter Barney had to swap a talent of his with one of another person or two who performs a talent for him.

Based on the original BBC children's Saturday morning show ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]'', which ran on [[BBC One]] from 1976 to 1982, it was hosted by [[Barney Harwood]], along with veteran puppet character [[Basil Brush]], from whom the show takes its title.\n\n==New format==\nThe new version of ''Swap Shop'' was [[live television|broadcast live]], and featured games and comedy sketches, as well as the \"swap shop\" itself (the studio audience brought items to exchange for this feature). Unlike the original series, this new format regularly features gungings for those taking part in the games. A total of three series were produced. In series 3, the name of the programme was changed to ''Basil and Barney's Swap Shop''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Series 1===\nThe first series ran for thirteen episodes of one hour. In addition to main presenters Basil Brush and Barney Harwood, [[Melvin Odoom]] (ex regular of ''[[Dick and Dom In Da Bungalow]]'' and regular of ''[[The Slammer]]'') was a featured performer who took a central role in many of the comedy sketches and games. Celebrity guests included [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]] and [[Joe Pasquale]].\n\nSeries one of Basil's Swap Shop featured gungey games. \"Question Line\", a game where children ask the celebrity guest questions and if the celebrity chooses to answer it the child doesn\u2019t get gunged. If however, the celebrity chooses not to answer the question the child asking the question slides into the gunge tank (a pool of gunge similar to the one on Waaa!!!). The children move as they are sitting in or lying across a rubber ring on a ramp with their legs hanging out on the \"gungeulator\" a red and white travelator. If the child does slide into the gunge tank then they have to move over and sit in the gunge tank until the game is over. Another game called Dunk Beds, is where there are 3 teams of 2 children, 1 is on a bed attached to a platform and the other child is off the bed. The child off the bed pushes the bed off along the platform, where along the platform are scoring zones. Up to a point, the points are negative then past a certain point, the points become positive until finally off the scale. If the bed goes off the scale the child on the end of the bed slides into a tank of green coloured water. 0 points are awarded if the child gets dunked. Each child from each team is on the bed once during the duration of the game. In the final Game, the final 2 children, left over from the previous game, play on a moving platform called the gungeulator collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, to get them back to the start of the \"gungeulator\". If a child falls then he/she is automatically gunged and the child that is left continues the game. However, if the child left wins then prizes are awarded to both the children but if both children are gunged the game is over and no prized are awarded. Whilst playing these games the children are barefoot except the final game where the children are dressed in fat suits wearing trainers on a moving platform\n\n===Series 2===\nSeries Two began without Melvin O'Doom on the presenting team. However, the show did feature a new comedy character, Ugly Yeti. The first two episodes did not have Basil live in the studio as he was ill in hospital.  The amount of live swaps was reduced from 10 to 5 and popular sketch Zeroes did not return. Celebrity guests included [[Tom Daley (diver)|Tom Daley]]. Team Sam & Lewis were proven to be the best when they made it to the final in Series 2. The credits for the show list Ugly Yeti as being played by Marcus Garvey. This was rumoured to be a reference to Rastafarian leader [[Marcus Garvey]], since some early reggae is played as background music on the show. The \"question line\" and \"gungeulator\" segments no longer featured. The \"Gunge Gallery\" along with a tweaked \"dunk beds\" featured instead. The \"Gunge Gallery\" is five gunge tanks in a row in which children (members of a karate club, football team etc.)\n\n===Series 3===\nMarcus Garvey returned to play Ugly Yeti and the name had been changed to ''Basil and Barney's Swap Shop'', not to forget the studio set refurbished. Dunk Beds and Yettis In Space returned, and 'Gold Brush Gold Rush' became the second game during the show. 'Gold Brush Gold Brush' is set in a western style town and the two teams have to power a conveyor belt with buckets of gunge up to a holder - the team who fills their holder goes through to the next game. This series saw host Barney Harwood absent for a few editions for some unknown reasons. [[Johny Pitts]] (of CBBC's [[Roar (UK TV series)|Roar]] and [[Help! Teach is Coming to Stay]]) was the official guest presenter filling in for Barney. Marcus Garvey who plays the Ugly Yeti had often been absence too. Special features in the series included 'Britain's Swaps Talent' where presenter Barney had to swap a talent of his with one of another person or two who performs a talent for him. Also the series included more comedy sketches featuring a wide range of characters, from Quiz Show Colin to Big Parrot, Little Pirate.\n\n==Basil's Game Show==\nA spin-off to the main Saturday morning show, this show consisted of only the games and some comedy from the previous Saturday broadcast; this show did not feature any swaps, or the celebrity interviews.\n\n==Dunk Beds==\nDunk Beds was a regular game on the show, in which one member of a team had to push a bed along a track with each part of it scored depending on how far it went.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.  Rarely, surfaces are cordmarked or smoothed over [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarking]].

The only exception to this would be with respect to the fine-line incising, which is a very late trait.

This cultural group was one of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes first encountered by [[Europe]]an explorers and [[fur traders]] in the 1600s, based on the presence of European trade goods at Oak Forest and Palos, but the specific tribal affiliation is unknown.  The initial researchers at Knoll Spring believed they had established an association of Huber pottery with early European trade goods, but subsequent investigators have determined these objects were probably intrusive, later period artifacts.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | author = Charles M.

It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], smooth surface pottery with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.  Rarely, surfaces are cordmarked or smoothed over [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarking]].  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippian Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nOf the Au Sagaunashke component potterly: 18% of the sherds had [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces; fine-to-medium incised line decoration was present on some sherds; 84% of the lips were notched, with wide-notching being the most common.

Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.

The only exception to this would be with respect to the fine-line incising, which is a very late trait.  The reason for this may be bias due to the smaller sample size; the Au Sagaunashke Component was composed of only 1,015 sherds compared with 6,077 sherds from Huber and over 12,000 sherds from Hoxie Farm.<ref name=\"Slaymaker\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Knoll Spring site assemblage resembles that of other Huber (Blue Island) sites in the [[Chicago]] Area, including Huber, [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]], Oak Forest, [[Palos Site|Palos]] and Anker.  This cultural group was one of the [[Native American]] tribes first encountered by [[Europe]]an explorers and [[fur traders]] in the 1600s, based on the presence of European trade goods at Oak Forest and Palos, but the specific tribal affiliation is unknown.  The initial researchers at Knoll Spring believed they had established an association of Huber pottery with early European trade goods, but subsequent investigators have determined these objects were probably intrusive, later period artifacts.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | author = Charles M.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for an [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]], which premiered on October 15, 2019. In March, it was announced this would serve as the final season of the series, consisting of ten episodes which would contribute to the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series concluded in full on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. The series has received several awards and multiple nominations.\n\nIn October 2014, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series titled ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' premiered.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |title=The CW Announces Fall Premiere Dates |work=TV by the Numbers |date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161634/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was the first extension of the shared universe that would be known as the \"Arrowverse\".

Guggenheim said, \"We still want to make [flashbacks] part of our storytelling, because we do like them.

Kreisberg said, \"There are so many characters in the DC Universe who haven't gotten their due in TV and film.

We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for an [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]], which premiered on October 15, 2019. In March, it was announced this would serve as the final season of the series, consisting of ten episodes which would contribute to the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series concluded in full on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]).

Guggenheim said, \"We still want to make [flashbacks] part of our storytelling, because we do like them.

Kreisberg said, \"There are so many characters in the DC Universe who haven't gotten their due in TV and film.

We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 7, 1996. In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] starts a [[bowling]] team with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], and [[Otto Mann|Otto]]. When [[Mr. Burns]] discovers the team was funded with his money, he insists on joining, but the team fears he will cost them the league championship. In the subplot, Bart's \"Down with homework\" T-shirt incites a school riot, so [[Principal Skinner]] implements a uniform dress code.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Scully]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. Scully came up with the idea for it when he went bowling one day. The episode features cultural references to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine and the film ''[[Caddyshack]]''. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.4, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.\n\n==Plot==\nHomer and his teammates &mdash; [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] and [[Otto Mann|Otto]] &mdash; are unable to afford the $500 fee to join a bowling league. Homer asks his boss to [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] the team while he is anesthetized, so [[Mr. Burns]] unwittingly signs a [[Cheque|check]]. The newly named Pin Pals enter a bowling competition. They beat three teams and move to second place in their league. After recovering from his [[Diethyl ether|ether]]-induced stupor, Burns discovers he wrote a check to Homer and insists on joining the Pin Pals, replacing Otto. Homer and the team fear they will lose the championship since Burns is an awful bowler.\n\nBurns gives the Pin Pals new [[Bowling shirt|bowling shirts]] before the championship game. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn on the lane. When Otto tips over a [[Claw crane|claw arcade machine]], the vibrations knock down the pins and the Pin Pals win. As the team celebrates, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Encouraged by his teammates, Homer attempts to break into Burns' mansion to recover the trophy; this ends disastrously when Burns releases the hounds and Homer is severely mauled.\n\nAt school, Bart's ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' [[Iron-on|iron-on]] \"Down with homework\" T-shirt incites a student riot, so Principal Skinner forces students to wear [[uniforms]], but not before explaining to Bart about \"Mad\" and its purpose. The new dress code demoralizes the students until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color to melt and reveal [[tie-dye]] colors that make the children resume rebelling against authority.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Scully by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Mike Scully]] wrote the episode.
