Homosexuals are known as {{lang|sw|shoga}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mashoga}}), and historically had certain social roles, such as drumming and playing music at marriages and other festivals.<ref>[http://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2000&x=qcolor Same sex relationships and gender identities among non-whites]</ref> The word {{lang|sw|shoga}} was also used by women to refer to \"friends\". Over time, {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships turned into economic relations, with poorer young men being paid by richer older men ({{lang|sw|basha}}, plural: {{lang|sw|mabasha}}) for sexual relations. Socially, only the {{lang|sw|mashoga}} were regarded as \"homosexual\", the {{lang|sw|mabasha}} would usually have a wife.<ref name=\"africa\"/><ref>[http://www.willsworld.org/africa.html Boy-Wives and Female Husbands]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mombasa's mashoga are passive male homosexuals offering their persons for money.

Mashoga have all the liberties of men and are also welcome in many contexts otherwise exclusive to women.|author=Gill Shepherd|date=1978}}\n\nLesbians relationships were also commonplace in Swahili society. Lesbians (known as {{lang|sw|msagaji}} or {{lang|sw|msago}} (plural: {{lang|sw|wasagaji}} or {{lang|sw|misago}}), literally ''grinders'') also had certain societal roles, including doing tasks typically associated with men. Similarly to {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships, {{lang|sw|msagaji}} relationships were also defined for economic purposes, though less so. The older partner ({{lang|sw|mama}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mwana}})) was typically wealthier and of a higher social class. Women who resisted marriage and were interested in education and careers were perceived as being {{lang|sw|wasagaji}}, regardless of their actual sexual orientation. Collectively, homosexuals were called {{lang|sw|mke-si-mume}} (literally ''woman, not man'').<ref name=\"africa\"/>\n\nAmong the [[Maasai people]], traditions of cross-dressing were common and typically performed at rituals. During initiation rituals, young male Maasai would often dress as women and wear the {{lang|mas|surutya}} (ear-rings worn by women to show that they are married) and other female garments.<ref name=\"africa\">[https://mkenyaujerumani.de/2014/02/01/homosexuality-unafrican-not-really/ Homosexuality unAfrican?

Though now not perceived as being \"homosexual\", these marriages are performed for economic and diplomatic purposes, such as when a family has no son.<ref>[http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/homosexuality-africamuseveniugandanigeriaethiopia.html Homosexuality is not un-African]</ref>\n\nSocietal acceptance and tolerance of homosexuality and same-sex relationships quickly disappeared after the arrival of the Europeans. Laws punishing homosexuality were enacted, and over time homophobia has become deeply ingrained in the population. In 2015, Adebisi Ademola Alimi, then a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], discussed this omnipresent homophobia in, not only Tanzania, but in Africa as a whole.\n\n{{quote|One factor is the increased popularity of fundamental Christianity, by way of American televangelists, since the 1980s.

But the Bible is not our historical culture.

Homosexuals are known as {{lang|sw|shoga}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mashoga}}), and historically had certain social roles, such as drumming and playing music at marriages and other festivals.<ref>[http://www.colorq.org/articles/article.aspx?d=2000&x=qcolor Same sex relationships and gender identities among non-whites]</ref> The word {{lang|sw|shoga}} was also used by women to refer to \"friends\". Over time, {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships turned into economic relations, with poorer young men being paid by richer older men ({{lang|sw|basha}}, plural: {{lang|sw|mabasha}}) for sexual relations. Socially, only the {{lang|sw|mashoga}} were regarded as \"homosexual\", the {{lang|sw|mabasha}} would usually have a wife.<ref name=\"africa\"/><ref>[http://www.willsworld.org/africa.html Boy-Wives and Female Husbands]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mombasa's mashoga are passive male homosexuals offering their persons for money. They advertise themselves in bright tight male attire in public places, usually, but may, when mingling with women at weddings, don women's leso cloths, make-up and jasmine posies. Mashoga have all the liberties of men and are also welcome in many contexts otherwise exclusive to women.|author=Gill Shepherd|date=1978}}\n\nLesbians relationships were also commonplace in Swahili society. Lesbians (known as {{lang|sw|msagaji}} or {{lang|sw|msago}} (plural: {{lang|sw|wasagaji}} or {{lang|sw|misago}}), literally ''grinders'') also had certain societal roles, including doing tasks typically associated with men. Similarly to {{lang|sw|shoga}} relationships, {{lang|sw|msagaji}} relationships were also defined for economic purposes, though less so. The older partner ({{lang|sw|mama}} (plural: {{lang|sw|mwana}})) was typically wealthier and of a higher social class. Women who resisted marriage and were interested in education and careers were perceived as being {{lang|sw|wasagaji}}, regardless of their actual sexual orientation. Collectively, homosexuals were called {{lang|sw|mke-si-mume}} (literally ''woman, not man'').<ref name=\"africa\"/>\n\nAmong the [[Maasai people]], traditions of cross-dressing were common and typically performed at rituals. During initiation rituals, young male Maasai would often dress as women and wear the {{lang|mas|surutya}} (ear-rings worn by women to show that they are married) and other female garments.<ref name=\"africa\">[https://mkenyaujerumani.de/2014/02/01/homosexuality-unafrican-not-really/ Homosexuality unAfrican? Not Really]</ref>\n\nAmong the [[Kuria people]], lesbian marriages were, and still are to some extent, quite commonplace. Though now not perceived as being \"homosexual\", these marriages are performed for economic and diplomatic purposes, such as when a family has no son.<ref>[http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/homosexuality-africamuseveniugandanigeriaethiopia.html Homosexuality is not un-African]</ref>\n\nSocietal acceptance and tolerance of homosexuality and same-sex relationships quickly disappeared after the arrival of the Europeans. Laws punishing homosexuality were enacted, and over time homophobia has become deeply ingrained in the population. In 2015, Adebisi Ademola Alimi, then a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], discussed this omnipresent homophobia in, not only Tanzania, but in Africa as a whole.\n\n{{quote|One factor is the increased popularity of fundamental Christianity, by way of American televangelists, since the 1980s. While Africans [argue] that homosexuality was a western import, they in turn [use] a western religion as the basis for their argument. When I have challenged people who are anti-gay, many have said that it is not our culture. However, when you probe further, they argue that homosexuality is not in the Bible. But the Bible is not our historical culture. This shows there is real confusion about Africa's past.|author=Adebisi Ademola Alimi}}\n\n==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==\nThroughout Tanzania, [[men who have sex with men|sex acts between men]] are illegal and carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. [[women who have sex with women|Sex acts between women]] are not mentioned specifically in mainland Tanzanian law. The semi-autonomous region of [[Zanzibar]] outlaws same-sex sexual acts between women with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment or a 500,000 [[Tanzanian shilling|shilling]] fine. Heterosexual oral and anal sex is also illegal.\n\n===Mainland Tanzania===\nThe Tanzania Penal Code of 1945 (as revised by the ''Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act, 1998'') provides as follows:\n\n<blockquote>* Section 138A. Acts of gross indecency between persons.\n:Any person who, in public or private commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of, any act of gross indecency with another person, is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not less than one year and not exceeding five years or to a fine not less than one hundred thousand and not exceeding three hundred thousand shillings; save that where the offence is committed by a person of eighteen years of age or more in respect of any person under eighteen years of age, a pupil of a primary school or a student of secondary school the offender shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not less than ten years, with corporal punishment, and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of all amount determined by the court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for any injuries caused to that person.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Part I(3) of the ''Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act, 1998'', \"gross indecency\" in Section 138A \"means any sexual act that is more than ordinary but falls short of actual intercourse and may include masturbation and indecent physical contact or indecent behaviour without any physical contact\".\n\n<blockquote>* Section 154. Unnatural offenses.\n:(1) Any person who -\n::(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; or\n::.    .    .\n::(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\n:commits an offence, and is liable to imprisonment for life and in any case to imprisonment for a term of not less than thirty years.\n:(2) Where the offence under subsection (1) of this section is committed to a child under the age of ten years the offender shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n* Section 155. Attempt to commit unnatural offences.\n:Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified under section 154 commits an offence and shall on conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not less than twenty years.\n\n*Section 157. Indecent practices between males.\n:Any male person who, in public or private -\n::(a) commits any act of gross indecency with another male, or\n::(b) procures another male person to commit any act of gross indecency with him, or\n::(c) attempts to procure a male to commit an indecent act to him,\n:is guilty of an offence and may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n\n===Zanzibar===\nThe Zanzibar Penal Code of 1934, as amended in 2004, provides as follows:<ref>[http://defensewiki.ibj.org/images/9/90/Zanzibar_Penal_Code.pdf \"Penal Decree Act No. 6 of 2004\", PDF by George Kazi, 2004]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>* Section 132.\n:(1) Any person who carnally knows any boy is guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for life.\n:(2) Any person who attempts to have carnal knowledge of any boy is guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term not less than twenty-five years.\n\n* Section 150.\n:Any person who:\n::(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; or\n::...\n::(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature;\n:is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.\n\n* Section 151.\n:Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 150 is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.\n\n* Section 152.\n:Any person who unlawfully and indecently assaults a boy is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for a term not less than twenty-five years.\n\n* Section 153.\n:Any woman who commits an act of lesbianism with another woman whether taking an active or passive role shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand shillings.\n\n* Section 154.\n:Any person who, in public or private commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of, any act of gross indecency with another person, is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine not exceeding two hundred thousand shillings; save that where the offence is committed by a person of eighteen years of age or more in respect of any person under eighteen years of age, the offender shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not less than ten years, with corporal punishment, and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by the court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for any injuries physical or psychological caused to that person.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Section 4, \"gross indecency\" means \"any sexual act that falls short of actual intercourse and may include masturbation and physical contact or indecent behaviour without any physical contact.\"\n\n<blockquote>\n* Section 158.\n:Any person who:\n::(a) enter[s] or arrange[s] a union, whether amounting to marriage or not, of the person of the same sex;\n::(b) celebrate[s] a union with another person of the same sex, whether amounting to marriage or not; [or]\n::(c) lives as husband and wife [with] another person of the same sex;\n:shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.</blockquote>\n\n==Recognition of same-sex relationships==\n[[Same-sex couples]] have no legal recognition.\n\n==Adoption and parenting==\nA couple is eligible to adopt a child jointly only if the couple is married. A man may adopt a female child as a sole applicant only if \"the court is satisfied that there are special circumstances which justify as an exceptional measure the making of an adoption order\". There are no special restrictions on a female adopting a male child as a sole applicant. Only a Tanzanian resident who is at least 25 years of age may adopt a child.

For example, ... a 19-year-old gay man who was arrested after departing a nightclub in [[Mbeya]] ... reported [that] police raped and beat him on the soles of his feet with canes, electric wires, and water pipes. ... Consensual same-sex sexual conduct is illegal on the mainland and on Zanzibar. On the mainland, acts of \"gross indecency\" between persons of the same sex are punishable by up to five years in prison. The law refers to same-sex sexual conduct as an \"unnatural offense\" and carries a prison sentence of 30 years to life. The law on Zanzibar establishes a penalty of up to 14 years in prison for men who engage in same-sex sexual conduct and five years for women. The burden of proof in such cases is significant. According to a recent Human Rights Watch report, ... [arrested] LGBT persons [were only] rarely ... [prosecuted. The arrests were] usually ... a pretext for police to collect bribes or coerce sex from vulnerable people. Nonetheless, the [Tanzanian Commission for Human Rights and Good Government's] ... 2011 prison visits revealed that \"unnatural offenses\" were among the most common reasons for pretrial detention of minors. In the past[,] courts ... charged individuals suspected of same-sex sexual conduct with loitering or prostitution.

There are a total of four Yugas: ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''. The four Yugas differ in duration, virtues, etc. where Satya Yuga has the most, Treta Yuga the 2<sup>nd</sup> most, Dvapara the 3<sup>rd</sup> most, and Kali Yuga the least.\n\nA '''Mahayuga''' or '''Chaturyuga''' (also an epoch) is a cycle of the Yugas which can be followed by another Mahayuga of the same duration. Each Mahayuga consists of a descending set of the four Yugas where one Mahayuga ends with Kali Yuga and another starts with Satya Yuga (S,T,D,K) (S,T,D,K).\n\nSome modern scholars believe in a Mahayuga consisting of a much shorter descending and ascending set of the four Yugas where each Mahayuga starts and ends with Satya Yuga and has two Kali Yugas occuring in the middle (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S) (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S). \n\nAccording to the epic [[Mahabharata]], the current age is Kali Yuga which started in 3102 BCE after [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] left this world. (See [[Kali Yuga]]). Examining each yuga's characteristics, one can easily see that the current age is Kali Yuga.\n\nSome modern scholars say that our present time is ascending Kali Yuga,<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BBwLVlOipyUC&pg=PA15&dq=four+yugas#v=onepage&q=four%20yugas&f=false| title=The Path to Immortality|page=15|first1= Mark L.|last1=Prophet|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Clare Prophet|author2-link=Elizabeth Clare Prophet|publisher= Summit University Press| isbn=9781932890099| year=2006}}</ref> while some other scholars say that Kali Yuga ended in 1700 CE and now we're in ascending Dwapara Yuga.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holy Science|last=Swami|first=Sri Yukeshwar Giri|publisher=Yogoda Satsang Society|year=1949|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of the four Yugas ==\nThere are four Yugas:\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' (or Krita Yuga)\n* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\n\n=== Characteristics of each Yuga ===\n\n* '''Satya Yuga''' (\"The age of truth\" or \"[[Golden Age#Hindu|Golden Age]]\"): The first and best yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished.

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\".

People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished.

However, FISH analyses of sperm, enabling hundreds of cells to be analyzed, have shown a very small increased faction of 24,YY spermatozoa in the ejaculate of XYY men (Table 12-1). Thus it appears the vast majority of spermatocytes lose the extra Y before entering meiosis, a very few XYY primary spermatocytes are able to slip through and produce YY (and XY) spermatozoa. These cytogenetic findings parallel the observation that XYY men have no ''discernible'' increase in risk to have children with a sex chromosome abnormality. A true increased risk of a fraction of a per cent could be distinguished only with the greatest of difficulty when the background population risk is of a similar order of magnitude. As for the autosomes, no convincing case exists for any increased risk for aneuploidy in the children of men with 47,XYY.<br />To our knowledge, there is no report of a discernibly increased risk for the XYY male to have chromosomally abnormal children. A slight increase in gonosomal imbalances in sperm (Table 12-1) might nevertheless lead some to choose prenatal diagnosis.}}</ref><ref name=\"Gardner 2012\">{{cite book|author1=Gardner, R.J.

For some, the urge to violence may be inborn\u2014traced to something called the Y chromosome...<br />Once in every 500 male births, for example, the sex chromosome complement is XXY rather than XY, thus erring in the direction of femaleness. The resulting individual, called a Klinefelter male, is usually retarded, unusually tall and sterile.<br />Erring in the other direction, however, is the XYY complement resulting in the \"supermale.\" He is also unusually tall and somewhat retarded, but appears to be highly, perhaps too highly, sexually motivated...<br />We were intrigued by Dr. Jacobs' contention that an extra Y chromosome results in tall stature, mild mental retardation, and severely disordered personality characterized by violent, aggressive behavior. We therefore planned to confirm and extend her studies.<br /><br />''Syndrome Status for the XYY''<br />The XXY male has long been thought to display a constellation of symptoms that makes him diagnosable; that is, he has achieved syndrome status. It would seem that the XYY male is fast achieving similar status. His symptoms, as we and other laboratories tend to think of them, are: extremely tall stature, long limbs and strikingly long arm span, facial acne, mild mental retardation, severe mental illness (including psychosis) and aggressive, antisocial behavior with a long history of arrests, frequently beginning at an early age.<br />On reading newspaper accounts of Richard Speck, who murdered eight Chicago student nurses in 1966, we noted all these traits and therefore concluded that Speck was a likely candidate for the XYY disorder. Independently, a cytogenetic laboratory in Chicago confirmed this hunch, reinforcing our inclination to believe that the XYY syndrome is really coming of age. It seems quite possible that in the XYY male, exemplified by Speck, biologists are describing in genetic terms a certain type of defective criminal who has long been explicitly recognized by the forensic psychiatrist.</blockquote></ref>\n\nIn April 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014using Telfer as a main source\u2014introduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in [[Paris]]<ref name=\"Daniel Hugon\">Daniel Hugon, Paris, France\n* {{cite news |author=Garrison, Lloyd |date=October 15, 1968 |title=French murder jury rejects chromosome defect as defense |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/15/archives/french-murder-jury-rejects-chromosome-defect-as-defense.html}}\n* {{cite magazine |author=. |date=October 25, 1968 |title=Criminal law: Question of Y |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=92 |issue=17 |page=76 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900408,00.html}}</ref> and [[Melbourne]]<ref name=\"Lawrence Hannell\">Lawrence Hannell, Melbourne, Australia\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Extra chromosome brings acquittal on murder charge |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=94 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/10/archives/extra-chromosome-brings-an-acquittal-on-murder-charge.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Auerbach, Stuart |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is basis for acquittal |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/185091562.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}}\n* {{cite news |author=Getze, George |date=February 3, 1969 |title=Australia precedent for XYY syndrome case held dubious |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/673351452.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}} An Australian murder case that was reported to have been decided on the basis of the so-called XYY syndrome actually was not concerned with chromosome counts at all.</ref>\u2014and falsely reported that Richard Speck was an XYY male and that the condition would be used in an appeal of his murder conviction.<ref name=\"Green 1985\"/><ref name=\"Lyons 1968\">{{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 21, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is linked to crime; Genetics linked to violent crimes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/21/archives/genetic-abnormality-is-linked-to-crime-genetics-linked-to-violent.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 22, 1968 |title=Ultimate Speck appeal may cite a genetic defect |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=43 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/22/archives/ultimate-speck-appeal-may-cite-a-genetic-defect.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Chromosome test for flaws costly; 2 scientists cite scarcity of skilled aides for analyses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/chromosome-test-for-flaws-costly-2-scientists-cite-scarcity-of.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=editorial |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Nature or nurture? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/nature-or-nurture.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Geneticist: Didn't test Speck |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=8}}<blockquote>Dr. Pergament said he and Dr. Sato, a research fellow, had absolutely no connection with the Speck case and never examined Speck.

However, FISH analyses of sperm, enabling hundreds of cells to be analyzed, have shown a very small increased faction of 24,YY spermatozoa in the ejaculate of XYY men (Table 12-1). Thus it appears the vast majority of spermatocytes lose the extra Y before entering meiosis, a very few XYY primary spermatocytes are able to slip through and produce YY (and XY) spermatozoa. These cytogenetic findings parallel the observation that XYY men have no ''discernible'' increase in risk to have children with a sex chromosome abnormality. A true increased risk of a fraction of a per cent could be distinguished only with the greatest of difficulty when the background population risk is of a similar order of magnitude. As for the autosomes, no convincing case exists for any increased risk for aneuploidy in the children of men with 47,XYY.<br />To our knowledge, there is no report of a discernibly increased risk for the XYY male to have chromosomally abnormal children.

For some, the urge to violence may be inborn\u2014traced to something called the Y chromosome...<br />Once in every 500 male births, for example, the sex chromosome complement is XXY rather than XY, thus erring in the direction of femaleness. The resulting individual, called a Klinefelter male, is usually retarded, unusually tall and sterile.<br />Erring in the other direction, however, is the XYY complement resulting in the \"supermale.\" He is also unusually tall and somewhat retarded, but appears to be highly, perhaps too highly, sexually motivated...<br />We were intrigued by Dr. Jacobs' contention that an extra Y chromosome results in tall stature, mild mental retardation, and severely disordered personality characterized by violent, aggressive behavior. We therefore planned to confirm and extend her studies.<br /><br />''Syndrome Status for the XYY''<br />The XXY male has long been thought to display a constellation of symptoms that makes him diagnosable; that is, he has achieved syndrome status. It would seem that the XYY male is fast achieving similar status. His symptoms, as we and other laboratories tend to think of them, are: extremely tall stature, long limbs and strikingly long arm span, facial acne, mild mental retardation, severe mental illness (including psychosis) and aggressive, antisocial behavior with a long history of arrests, frequently beginning at an early age.<br />On reading newspaper accounts of Richard Speck, who murdered eight Chicago student nurses in 1966, we noted all these traits and therefore concluded that Speck was a likely candidate for the XYY disorder. Independently, a cytogenetic laboratory in Chicago confirmed this hunch, reinforcing our inclination to believe that the XYY syndrome is really coming of age. It seems quite possible that in the XYY male, exemplified by Speck, biologists are describing in genetic terms a certain type of defective criminal who has long been explicitly recognized by the forensic psychiatrist.</blockquote></ref>\n\nIn April 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014using Telfer as a main source\u2014introduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in [[Paris]]<ref name=\"Daniel Hugon\">Daniel Hugon, Paris, France\n* {{cite news |author=Garrison, Lloyd |date=October 15, 1968 |title=French murder jury rejects chromosome defect as defense |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/15/archives/french-murder-jury-rejects-chromosome-defect-as-defense.html}}\n* {{cite magazine |author=. |date=October 25, 1968 |title=Criminal law: Question of Y |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=92 |issue=17 |page=76 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900408,00.html}}</ref> and [[Melbourne]]<ref name=\"Lawrence Hannell\">Lawrence Hannell, Melbourne, Australia\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Extra chromosome brings acquittal on murder charge |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=94 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/10/archives/extra-chromosome-brings-an-acquittal-on-murder-charge.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Auerbach, Stuart |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is basis for acquittal |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/185091562.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}}\n* {{cite news |author=Getze, George |date=February 3, 1969 |title=Australia precedent for XYY syndrome case held dubious |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/673351452.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}} An Australian murder case that was reported to have been decided on the basis of the so-called XYY syndrome actually was not concerned with chromosome counts at all.</ref>\u2014and falsely reported that Richard Speck was an XYY male and that the condition would be used in an appeal of his murder conviction.<ref name=\"Green 1985\"/><ref name=\"Lyons 1968\">{{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 21, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is linked to crime; Genetics linked to violent crimes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/21/archives/genetic-abnormality-is-linked-to-crime-genetics-linked-to-violent.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 22, 1968 |title=Ultimate Speck appeal may cite a genetic defect |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=43 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/22/archives/ultimate-speck-appeal-may-cite-a-genetic-defect.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Chromosome test for flaws costly; 2 scientists cite scarcity of skilled aides for analyses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/chromosome-test-for-flaws-costly-2-scientists-cite-scarcity-of.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=editorial |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Nature or nurture? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/nature-or-nurture.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Geneticist: Didn't test Speck |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=8}}<blockquote>Dr. Pergament said he and Dr. Sato, a research fellow, had absolutely no connection with the Speck case and never examined Speck.

It is named after its inventor, [[L\u00e9on Theremin]], who patented the device in 1928.\n\nThe instrument's controlling section usually consists of two metal [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] that sense the relative position of the thereminist's hands and control [[oscillation|oscillators]] for [[frequency]] with one hand, and [[amplitude]] ([[Loudness|volume]]) with the other. The electric [[signal]]s from the theremin are [[amplifier|amplified]] and sent to a [[loudspeaker]].\n\nThe sound of the instrument is often associated with [[wikt:eerie|eerie]] situations. Thus, the theremin has been used in movie [[soundtrack]]s such as [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]]'s ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' and ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (soundtrack)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', and [[Justin Hurwitz]]'s ''[[First Man (film)|First Man]]'', as well as in [[Theme music|theme songs]] for [[television show]]s such as the ITV drama ''[[Midsomer Murders]]''. The theremin is also used in concert music (especially [[Experimental music|avant-garde]] and 20th- and 21st-century [[Contemporary classical music|new music]]), and in popular music genres such as [[rock music|rock]].\n\n[[File:Theramin-Alexandra-Stepanoff-1930.jpg|thumb|Alexandra Stepanoff playing the theremin on [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]], 1930]]\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|L\u00e9on Theremin}}\nThe theremin was the product of Soviet government-sponsored research into [[proximity sensor]]s.

However, a niche interest in the theremin persisted, mostly among electronics enthusiasts and kit-building hobbyists. One of these electronics enthusiasts, [[Robert Moog]], began building theremins in the 1950s, while he was a high-school student. Moog subsequently published a number of articles about building theremins, and sold theremin kits that were intended to be assembled by the customer. Moog credited what he learned from the experience as leading directly to his groundbreaking [[synthesizer]], the [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]]. (Around 1955, a colleague of Moog's, electronic music pioneer [[Raymond Scott]], purchased one of Moog's theremin subassemblies to incorporate into a new invention, the [[Clavivox]], which was intended to be an easy-to-use keyboard theremin.)<ref>[http://raymondscott.net/features/moog/ 1993 interview with Robert Moog posted at RaymondScott.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311020751/http://raymondscott.net/features/moog/ |date=2016-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nSince the release of the film ''[[Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey]]'' in 1993, the instrument has enjoyed a resurgence in interest and has become more widely used by contemporary musicians. Even though many theremin sounds can be approximated on many modern synthesizers, some musicians continue to appreciate the expressiveness, novelty, and uniqueness of using an actual theremin. The film itself has garnered excellent reviews.<ref>[http://www.mrqe.com/movies?q=Theremin MRQE \u2013 Movie Review Query Engine \u2013 Theremin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918144710/http://www.mrqe.com/movies?q=Theremin |date=2009-09-18 }}, see also the rare 100% score at [http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/theremin_an_electronic_odyssey/ Rotten Tomatoes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210033322/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/theremin_an_electronic_odyssey/ |date=2007-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nBoth theremin instruments and kits are available.  The [http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/ Open Theremin], an [[Open-hardware|open hardware]] and [[open software]] project, was developed by swiss microengineer Urz Gaudenz, using the original [[heterodyne]] oscillator architecture for an authentic playing experience,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sound and Oscillators|url=http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/index.php/home/sound-and-oscillators|publisher= GaudiLabs |date=2018-05-17|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> combined with [[Arduino]]. Using a few extra components a [[MIDI]] interface can be added to the Open Theremin, enabling a player to use their Theremin to control different instrument sounds.\n\nSome inexpensive theremins may only have a pitch control and may be harder to play accurately because of a relatively non-linear relationship between the distance of the hand and resultant pitch, as well as a relatively short span of hand-to-antenna distance for producing the available range of pitch.\n\n== Operating principles ==\n[[File:Block diagram Theremin.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Block diagram of a theremin. Volume control in lavender, pitch control in yellow and audio output in salmon.]]\nThe theremin is distinguished among musical instruments in that it is played without physical contact. The thereminist stands in front of the instrument and moves his or her hands in the proximity of two metal antennas. The distance from one antenna determines frequency (pitch), and the distance from the other controls amplitude (volume). Higher notes are played by moving the hand closer to the pitch antenna. Louder notes are played by moving the hand away from the volume antenna.\n\nMost frequently, the right hand controls the pitch and the left controls the volume, although some performers reverse this arrangement. Some low-cost theremins use a conventional, knob operated volume control and have only the pitch antenna. While commonly called antennas, they are not used for receiving or broadcasting radio waves, but act as plates of  [[capacitor]]s.\n\nThe theremin uses the [[heterodyne]] principle to generate an audio signal. The instrument's pitch circuitry includes two [[radio frequency]] [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s set below 500 [[Hertz|kHz]] to minimize radio interference. One oscillator operates at a fixed frequency. The frequency of the other oscillator is almost identical, and is controlled by the performer's distance from the pitch control antenna.\n\nThe performer's hand acts as the [[ground (electricity)|grounded]] plate (the performer's body being the connection to ground) of a [[variable capacitor]] in an [[LC circuit|L-C (inductance-capacitance) circuit]], which is part of the oscillator and determines its frequency. In the simplest designs, the antenna is directly coupled to the tuned circuit of the oscillator and the 'pitch field', that is the change of note with distance, is highly nonlinear, as the capacitance change with distance is far greater near the antenna. In such systems, when the antenna is removed, the oscillator moves up in frequency.\n \nTo partly linearise the pitch field, the antenna may be wired in series with an inductor to form a series [[tuned circuit]], resonating with the parallel combination of the antenna's intrinsic capacitance and the capacitance of the player's hand in proximity to the antenna. This series tuned circuit is then connected in parallel with the parallel [[tuned circuit]] of the variable pitch oscillator. With the antenna circuit disconnected, the oscillator  is tuned to a frequency slightly higher than the stand alone resonant frequency of the antenna circuit. At that frequency, the antenna and its linearisation coil present an inductive impedance; and when connected, behaves as an inductor in parallel with the oscillator. Thus, connecting the antenna and linearising coil raises the oscillation frequency.  Close to the resonant frequency of the antenna circuit, the effective inductance is small, and the effect on the oscillator is greatest; farther from it, the effective inductance is larger, and fractional change on the oscillator is reduced.\n\nWhen the hand is distant from the antenna, the resonant frequency of the antenna series circuit is at its highest; i.e., it is closest to the free running frequency of the oscillator, and small changes in antenna capacitance have greatest effect. Under this condition, the effective inductance in the tank circuit is at its minimum and the oscillation frequency is at its maximum. The steepening rate of change of shunt impedance with  hand position compensates for the reduced influence of the hand being further away. With careful tuning, a near linear region of pitch field can be created over the central 2 or 3 octaves of operation. Using optimized pitch field linearisation,  circuits can be made where a change in [[capacitance]] between the performer and the instrument in the order of 0.01 [[Farad|picofarads]] produces a full octave of frequency shift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelroadamps.com/articles/theremin/|title=Channel Road Amplification: Vacuum Tube Theremin|author=|date=|website=www.channelroadamps.com}}</ref>\n\nThe mixer produces the audio-range difference between the frequencies of the two oscillators at each moment, which is the tone that is then wave shaped and amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.\n\nTo control volume, the performer's other hand acts as the grounded plate of another variable capacitor. As in the tone circuit, the distance between the performer's hand and the volume control antenna determines the capacitance and hence natural resonant frequency of an LC circuit inductively coupled to another fixed LC oscillator circuit operating at a slightly higher resonant frequency. When a hand approaches the antenna, the natural frequency of that  circuit is lowered by the extra capacitance, which detunes the oscillator and lowers its resonant plate current.\n\nIn the earliest theremins, the RF plate current of the oscillator is picked up by another winding and used to power the filament of another diode-connected triode, which thus acts as a variable conductance element changing the output amplitude.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title=RCA Theremin circuit diagram\n  | url=http://www.pavekmuseum.org/theremin/theop.html\n}}</ref>  The harmonic timbre of the output, not being a pure tone, was an important feature of the theremin.<ref>{{cite web|title=How is the Electro-Theremin different from the traditional theremin?|url=http://www.electrotheremin.com/etfaq.htm }}</ref> Theremin's original design included audio frequency series/parallel LC formant filters as well as a 3-winding variable-saturation transformer to control or induce harmonics in the audio output.<ref name=\"patent\" />\n\nModern circuit designs often simplify this circuit and avoid the complexity of two heterodyne oscillators by having a single pitch oscillator, akin to the original theremin's volume circuit. This approach is usually less stable and cannot generate the low frequencies that a heterodyne oscillator can. Better designs (e.g., Moog, Theremax) may use two pairs of heterodyne oscillators, for both pitch and volume.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vennard |first=Martin |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17340257 |title=BBC News \u2013 Leon Theremin: The man and the music machine |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1929-03-12 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref>\n\n== Performance technique ==\n[[File:Robotic Theremin.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Robot playing Theremin]]\nImportant in theremin articulation is the use of the volume control antenna. Unlike touched instruments, where simply halting play or damping a resonator in the traditional sense silences the instrument, the thereminist must \"play the rests, as well as the notes\", as [[Clara Rockmore]] observed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moog |first=Bob |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/21/1/22/ |title=Theremin Vox \u2013 In Clara's Words |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2002-10-26 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> \nIf the pitch hand is moved between notes, without first lowering the volume hand, the result is a \"swooping\" sound akin to a [[swanee whistle]] or a glissando played on the [[violin]]. Small flutters of the pitch hand can be used to produce a vibrato effect. To produce distinct notes requires a pecking action with the volume hand to mute the volume while the pitch hand moves between positions.\n[[File:Carolina Eyck demonstrates her playing technique.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Carolina Eyck demonstrates the eight finger position.]]\nThereminists such as [[Carolina Eyck]] use a fixed arm position per octave, and use fixed positions of the fingers to create the notes within the octave, allowing very fast transitions between adjacent notes.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n-o71RUrQw How to play a scale on the theremin  | Carolina talks Theremin]</ref>\nAlthough volume technique is less developed than pitch technique, some thereminists have worked to extend it, especially [[Pamelia Kurstin]] with her \"[[walking bass]]\" technique<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/pamelia_kurstin_plays_the_theremin.html Pamelia Kurstin plays the Theremin].

However, a niche interest in the theremin persisted, mostly among electronics enthusiasts and kit-building hobbyists. One of these electronics enthusiasts, [[Robert Moog]], began building theremins in the 1950s, while he was a high-school student. Moog subsequently published a number of articles about building theremins, and sold theremin kits that were intended to be assembled by the customer. Moog credited what he learned from the experience as leading directly to his groundbreaking [[synthesizer]], the [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]]. (Around 1955, a colleague of Moog's, electronic music pioneer [[Raymond Scott]], purchased one of Moog's theremin subassemblies to incorporate into a new invention, the [[Clavivox]], which was intended to be an easy-to-use keyboard theremin.)<ref>[http://raymondscott.net/features/moog/ 1993 interview with Robert Moog posted at RaymondScott.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311020751/http://raymondscott.net/features/moog/ |date=2016-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nSince the release of the film ''[[Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey]]'' in 1993, the instrument has enjoyed a resurgence in interest and has become more widely used by contemporary musicians. Even though many theremin sounds can be approximated on many modern synthesizers, some musicians continue to appreciate the expressiveness, novelty, and uniqueness of using an actual theremin. The film itself has garnered excellent reviews.<ref>[http://www.mrqe.com/movies?q=Theremin MRQE \u2013 Movie Review Query Engine \u2013 Theremin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918144710/http://www.mrqe.com/movies?q=Theremin |date=2009-09-18 }}, see also the rare 100% score at [http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/theremin_an_electronic_odyssey/ Rotten Tomatoes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210033322/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/theremin_an_electronic_odyssey/ |date=2007-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nBoth theremin instruments and kits are available.  The [http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/ Open Theremin], an [[Open-hardware|open hardware]] and [[open software]] project, was developed by swiss microengineer Urz Gaudenz, using the original [[heterodyne]] oscillator architecture for an authentic playing experience,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sound and Oscillators|url=http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin/index.php/home/sound-and-oscillators|publisher= GaudiLabs |date=2018-05-17|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> combined with [[Arduino]]. Using a few extra components a [[MIDI]] interface can be added to the Open Theremin, enabling a player to use their Theremin to control different instrument sounds.\n\nSome inexpensive theremins may only have a pitch control and may be harder to play accurately because of a relatively non-linear relationship between the distance of the hand and resultant pitch, as well as a relatively short span of hand-to-antenna distance for producing the available range of pitch.\n\n== Operating principles ==\n[[File:Block diagram Theremin.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Block diagram of a theremin. Volume control in lavender, pitch control in yellow and audio output in salmon.]]\nThe theremin is distinguished among musical instruments in that it is played without physical contact. The thereminist stands in front of the instrument and moves his or her hands in the proximity of two metal antennas. The distance from one antenna determines frequency (pitch), and the distance from the other controls amplitude (volume). Higher notes are played by moving the hand closer to the pitch antenna. Louder notes are played by moving the hand away from the volume antenna.\n\nMost frequently, the right hand controls the pitch and the left controls the volume, although some performers reverse this arrangement. Some low-cost theremins use a conventional, knob operated volume control and have only the pitch antenna. While commonly called antennas, they are not used for receiving or broadcasting radio waves, but act as plates of  [[capacitor]]s.\n\nThe theremin uses the [[heterodyne]] principle to generate an audio signal. The instrument's pitch circuitry includes two [[radio frequency]] [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s set below 500 [[Hertz|kHz]] to minimize radio interference. One oscillator operates at a fixed frequency. The frequency of the other oscillator is almost identical, and is controlled by the performer's distance from the pitch control antenna.\n\nThe performer's hand acts as the [[ground (electricity)|grounded]] plate (the performer's body being the connection to ground) of a [[variable capacitor]] in an [[LC circuit|L-C (inductance-capacitance) circuit]], which is part of the oscillator and determines its frequency. In the simplest designs, the antenna is directly coupled to the tuned circuit of the oscillator and the 'pitch field', that is the change of note with distance, is highly nonlinear, as the capacitance change with distance is far greater near the antenna. In such systems, when the antenna is removed, the oscillator moves up in frequency.\n \nTo partly linearise the pitch field, the antenna may be wired in series with an inductor to form a series [[tuned circuit]], resonating with the parallel combination of the antenna's intrinsic capacitance and the capacitance of the player's hand in proximity to the antenna. This series tuned circuit is then connected in parallel with the parallel [[tuned circuit]] of the variable pitch oscillator. With the antenna circuit disconnected, the oscillator  is tuned to a frequency slightly higher than the stand alone resonant frequency of the antenna circuit. At that frequency, the antenna and its linearisation coil present an inductive impedance; and when connected, behaves as an inductor in parallel with the oscillator. Thus, connecting the antenna and linearising coil raises the oscillation frequency.  Close to the resonant frequency of the antenna circuit, the effective inductance is small, and the effect on the oscillator is greatest; farther from it, the effective inductance is larger, and fractional change on the oscillator is reduced.\n\nWhen the hand is distant from the antenna, the resonant frequency of the antenna series circuit is at its highest; i.e., it is closest to the free running frequency of the oscillator, and small changes in antenna capacitance have greatest effect. Under this condition, the effective inductance in the tank circuit is at its minimum and the oscillation frequency is at its maximum. The steepening rate of change of shunt impedance with  hand position compensates for the reduced influence of the hand being further away. With careful tuning, a near linear region of pitch field can be created over the central 2 or 3 octaves of operation. Using optimized pitch field linearisation,  circuits can be made where a change in [[capacitance]] between the performer and the instrument in the order of 0.01 [[Farad|picofarads]] produces a full octave of frequency shift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelroadamps.com/articles/theremin/|title=Channel Road Amplification: Vacuum Tube Theremin|author=|date=|website=www.channelroadamps.com}}</ref>\n\nThe mixer produces the audio-range difference between the frequencies of the two oscillators at each moment, which is the tone that is then wave shaped and amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.\n\nTo control volume, the performer's other hand acts as the grounded plate of another variable capacitor. As in the tone circuit, the distance between the performer's hand and the volume control antenna determines the capacitance and hence natural resonant frequency of an LC circuit inductively coupled to another fixed LC oscillator circuit operating at a slightly higher resonant frequency. When a hand approaches the antenna, the natural frequency of that  circuit is lowered by the extra capacitance, which detunes the oscillator and lowers its resonant plate current.\n\nIn the earliest theremins, the RF plate current of the oscillator is picked up by another winding and used to power the filament of another diode-connected triode, which thus acts as a variable conductance element changing the output amplitude.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title=RCA Theremin circuit diagram\n  | url=http://www.pavekmuseum.org/theremin/theop.html\n}}</ref>  The harmonic timbre of the output, not being a pure tone, was an important feature of the theremin.<ref>{{cite web|title=How is the Electro-Theremin different from the traditional theremin?|url=http://www.electrotheremin.com/etfaq.htm }}</ref> Theremin's original design included audio frequency series/parallel LC formant filters as well as a 3-winding variable-saturation transformer to control or induce harmonics in the audio output.<ref name=\"patent\" />\n\nModern circuit designs often simplify this circuit and avoid the complexity of two heterodyne oscillators by having a single pitch oscillator, akin to the original theremin's volume circuit. This approach is usually less stable and cannot generate the low frequencies that a heterodyne oscillator can. Better designs (e.g., Moog, Theremax) may use two pairs of heterodyne oscillators, for both pitch and volume.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vennard |first=Martin |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17340257 |title=BBC News \u2013 Leon Theremin: The man and the music machine |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1929-03-12 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref>\n\n== Performance technique ==\n[[File:Robotic Theremin.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Robot playing Theremin]]\nImportant in theremin articulation is the use of the volume control antenna. Unlike touched instruments, where simply halting play or damping a resonator in the traditional sense silences the instrument, the thereminist must \"play the rests, as well as the notes\", as [[Clara Rockmore]] observed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moog |first=Bob |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/21/1/22/ |title=Theremin Vox \u2013 In Clara's Words |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2002-10-26 |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> \nIf the pitch hand is moved between notes, without first lowering the volume hand, the result is a \"swooping\" sound akin to a [[swanee whistle]] or a glissando played on the [[violin]]. Small flutters of the pitch hand can be used to produce a vibrato effect. To produce distinct notes requires a pecking action with the volume hand to mute the volume while the pitch hand moves between positions.\n[[File:Carolina Eyck demonstrates her playing technique.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Carolina Eyck demonstrates the eight finger position.]]\nThereminists such as [[Carolina Eyck]] use a fixed arm position per octave, and use fixed positions of the fingers to create the notes within the octave, allowing very fast transitions between adjacent notes.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n-o71RUrQw How to play a scale on the theremin  | Carolina talks Theremin]</ref>\nAlthough volume technique is less developed than pitch technique, some thereminists have worked to extend it, especially [[Pamelia Kurstin]] with her \"[[walking bass]]\" technique<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/pamelia_kurstin_plays_the_theremin.html Pamelia Kurstin plays the Theremin].
