Many drivers have been Red Bull Juniors, including [[Michael Ammerm\u00fcller]], [[Neel Jani]], [[Filipe Albuquerque]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]], [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]], [[Daniil Kvyat]], [[Carlos Sainz, Jr.]], [[Dan Ticktum]], Jack Doohan and Dennis Hauger.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formula 3000===\nThe team was initially created as a vehicle to enable Christian Horner to race in F3000 in [[1997 International Formula 3000 season|1997]]. According to Horner he set the team up with borrowed money, including a loan from his father, and persuaded [[P1 Motorsport]] founder Roly Vincini (who Horner had driven for in his first season of F3) to take on the role of his race engineer. He bought a second-hand trailer for the team from [[Helmut Marko]], who as head of the [[Red Bull Junior Team]] was one of Horner's main rivals as a manager in F3000, and who he later worked closely with at Red Bull. He stayed in F3000 for 1998 and was joined at Arden by [[Kurt Mollekens]], who showed good pace and led the championship at one stage.<ref name=ms>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/january-2012/66/lunch-christian-horner |title=Lunch with... Christian Horner |last=Taylor |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Taylor (journalist) |date=January 2012|website=Motor Sport (magazine)|access-date=1 October 2016}}</ref> In the winter of 1998 family friend [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] had been approached by Russian oil company [[Lukoil]] to enable them to enter motorsports sponsorship. As entries to F3000 were restricted, Richards agreed a deal with Horner that [[Prodrive]] would take a 50% stake in Arden, in return for Horner becoming team manager. As a result, the team signed [[Viktor Maslov (racing driver)|Viktor Maslov]] as a driver under the Lukoil deal from [[1999 International Formula 3000 season|1999]]. The team started off poorly, and didn't have the pace to qualify for many races.\n\nAt the end of 1999, Richards sold a stake in Prodrive to [[Apax Partners]], who didn't want to continue in F3000. Horner hence exercised the option to buy back the Prodrive stake. As the years went on, the team began to reap the results and was the best team of Formula 3000 in its last 3 years, showing new talents to motorsport world like [[Darren Manning]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Wirdheim]] and [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]].\n\n[[File:Bjorn Wirdheim 2003 F3000 Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bj\u00f6rn Wirdheim]] in 2003 racing at Hungary]]\nThe team won the Teams' Championship in [[2002 International Formula 3000 season|2002]], [[2003 Formula 3000 season|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3000 season|2004]]. During those years, Wirdheim won the drivers championship in 2003, and Liuzzi won it in 2004.\n\nDuring the teams 8 years in the series, it has scored 359 points, won 16 races and achieved 20 [[pole position]]s.\n\n===Italian Formula 3000===\nThe team joined the Italian Formula 3000 series for [[1999 Italian Formula 3000 season|1999]] and [[2000 Italian Formula 3000 season|2000]]. Their first season was poor with only one point to their name, but the 2000 season went significantly better, with [[Warren Hughes]] taking two wins, one pole position and three fastest laps for the team, and [[Darren Manning]] taking one win, one pole and one fastest lap too. The team finished with Hughes second in the championship, and the team winning it outright 51 points.\n\n===A1 GP===\nArden operated [[A1 Team Great Britain]] in the first season of the [[A1 Grand Prix|A1GP]] series for [[2005-06 A1 Grand Prix season|2005\u20132006]]. The team fared well in their first season, collecting 8 podium finishes and a single pole position, leaving the team 3rd in the championship with 97 points overall.\n\n===GP2===\nIn [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]], the F3000 series was rebranded as the GP2 Series, Arden stayed on for the new series and achieved second place in the teams' championship with [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Nicolas Lapierre]], and second place in the Drivers' Championship with Kovalainen, who had 5 wins, 4 pole positions and a fastest lap to his name.\n\n[[File:Yelmer Buurman 2008 GP2 Silverstone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yelmer Buurman]] driving at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].]]\n\nIn [[2006 GP2 Series|2006]], Arden competed in GP2 with Lapierre and the rookie [[Michael Ammerm\u00fcller]] ([[Neel Jani]] acted as a substitute for Lapierre when the latter was injured in the race at [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]]). This year, Arden suffered a significant drop in performance, and had only 57 points to show and a single win from Ammerm\u00fcller, compared to the previous season's 126. Overall the team came fourth in the championship.\n\nFor [[2007 GP2 Series|2007]], Arden signed [[Bruno Senna]], nephew of triple F1 champion [[Ayrton Senna]], and [[A1 Team South Africa]] driver [[Adrian Zaugg]]. Zaugg was replaced for the final round of the season by [[Filipe Albuquerque]]. This season was even worse for the team compared to the previous year, only managing 42 points which resulted in a seventh-placed finish in the teams' championship, with Senna finishing ninth overall in the drivers' championship.\n\nFor [[2008 GP2 Series|2008]] and the newly founded [[2008 GP2 Asia Series|Asia Series]], the team was renamed [[Trust (electronics)|Trust]] Team Arden, after its [[Netherlands|Dutch]] title sponsor [[Trust (electronics)|Trust]]. The duo of [[Red Bull Junior Team]] driver [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Yelmer Buurman]] was its race line-up for both championships. For the Asia Series, [[Adam Khan]] raced for the first two rounds before being replaced by Buurman. The overall result in the Asia Series was the team finishing second in the championship, with 50 points and one win, and Buemi finishing second in the drivers' championship. Mid-season in the main series, Buurman was replaced by [[ART Grand Prix]] outcast [[Luca Filippi]]. The season went slightly better than the previous one with the team picking up 50 points, enough to take sixth place, and Buemi picked up two race victories to finish sixth overall in the drivers' championship.\n\n[[File:Mortara + Nunes 2009 GP2 Turkey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edoardo Mortara|Mortara]] leading at the race in Turkey]]\n\nArden again took part in the Asia Series for the [[2008\u201309 GP2 Asia Series|2008\u201309 season]], signing [[Luiz Razia]] and [[Mika M\u00e4ki]]. For the second round of the championship, held at the [[Dubai Autodrome]], M\u00e4ki was replaced by [[Renger van der Zande]], who was subsequently replaced for the rest of the season by [[Edoardo Mortara]]. Razia scored the team's only win of the campaign, which allowed Arden to finish sixth in the teams' championship. For the [[2009 GP2 Series|2009 main Series]], the team signed F3 frontrunners [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] and Mortara. This was also another poor season for the team, as it finished well down the order in eighth place overall with only Mortara managing a single win.\n\nFor the [[2009\u201310 GP2 Asia Series|2009\u201310]] Asia Series, Arden signed [[Charles Pic]] and [[Rodolfo Gonz\u00e1lez]]. After the first round, Gonz\u00e1lez was replaced by [[Javier Villa]] for the rest of the season. This was the team's most successful outing in the Asia Series, with an end result of 37 points and second in the teams' championship. Villa finished fourth overall in the drivers' championship with 19 points, and Pic finished fifth with a single race victory. For the [[2010 GP2 Series|2010 main series]], the team kept Pic and resigned Gonz\u00e1lez. However, the success from the Asia Series did not quite continue into the main series as the team eventually finished seventh with one win, courtesy of Pic. Arden finished with fewer points than in [[2009 GP2 Series|2009]], but still managed to beat the previous teams' championship result of eighth position.\n\n[[File:J Palmer Monza 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Jolyon Palmer]] driving at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in [[2011 GP2 Series|2011]].]]\n\nFor the [[2011 GP2 Asia Series]] and [[2011 GP2 Series|2011 GP2 Main Series]] seasons, the team signed [[Josef Kr\u00e1l]] and [[Jolyon Palmer]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://gp2series.com/News-Room/News/2011/01_Jan/Kral-and-Palmer-join-Arden-for-2011-GP2-season/ | title = KRAL AND PALMER JOIN ARDEN FOR 2011 GP2 SEASON | work = gp2series.com | date = 2011-01-26 | accessdate = 2011-01-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120711031306/http://gp2series.com/News-Room/News/2011/01_Jan/Kral-and-Palmer-join-Arden-for-2011-GP2-season/ | archivedate = 2012-07-11 }}</ref> The year was the team's worst so far in its GP2 history, as neither driver managed a win, pole or fastest lap in either series, and the team ended up finishing tenth in the Asia series and eleventh in the main series.\n\nAs the [[GP2 Asia Series]] had joined together with the [[GP2 Series|GP2 main series]] in 2012, there were no longer two separate series. The team signed former [[2008\u201309 GP2 Asia Series|2008\u201309 Asia season]] driver Luiz Razia and former MW Arden GP3 sister team driver [[Simon Trummer]] for the [[2012 GP2 Series|2012]] season. Razia won the feature race of the first round in [[Sepang International Circuit|Malaysia]], picked up two 2nd-place finishes during the two [[Bahrain International Circuit|Bahrain]] rounds, and won again at [[Circuit de Catalunya|Catalunya]], [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. He finished the season as runner-up to champion [[Davide Valsecchi]], whilst Trummer had a best race finish of seventh place to take 23rd in the drivers' championship. Arden finished third in the team's championship; its best result since 2005.\n\nFrom there Arden struggled in subsequent GP2 Series, their highest constructor's finish being an eighth in [[2013 GP2 Series|2013]], and went without a win till the end of the series under the GP2 moniker.\n\n===GP3===\nFrom [[2010 GP3 Series|2010]] onwards, they have operated a [[GP3 Series]] team with [[Mark Webber]], the team was called MW Arden.\n\nThe team signed [[Michael Christensen (racing driver)|Michael Christensen]], [[Miki Monr\u00e1s]] and [[Leonardo Cordeiro]] for their debut season. Their first venture into the new series proved difficult as they only accumulate 18 points for the whole season with 2 fastest laps, leaving them 9th in the championship.\n\nFor [[2011 GP3 Series|2011]], the team completely refreshed their line up by signing [[Mitch Evans]], [[Simon Trummer]] and [[Lewis Williamson]]. The season overshadowed the previous as the team came second overall in the constructors championship with 69 points, and both Williamson and Evans scoring 1 win each and coming 8th and 9th in the drivers championship respectively. This would also be the season where the team picked up its first pole positions with 2 from Evans and 1 from Williamson.\n\nFor [[2012 GP3 Series|2012]], they retained Evans, and partnered him with [[David Fumanelli]] and [[Matias Laine]]. Evans former teammates [[Simon Trummer]] and [[Lewis Williamson]] had moved to the GP2 sister team, and the new Formula Renault team '''Arden Caterham''' respectively. At the first round in [[Circuit de Catalunya|Spain]], Evans won the feature race. At the third round in Valencia, Evans managed to collect pole position and went on to win another feature race.\n\nEvans went on to win the championship in the 2012 season.\n\nThe team scored their second driver's championship with [[Daniil Kvyat]] the following season, with [[Carlos Sainz, Jr.]] and [[Robert Vi\u0219oiu]] finishing tenth and eleventh respectively. In the following two seasons, Arden scored fifth and third in the team's championship respectively, with the highest driver standing coming from a fourth place for [[Emil Bernstorff]] in [[2015 GP3 Series|2015]].\n\n[[Jake Dennis]], [[2015 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 season|2015 Eurocup]] champion [[Jack Aitken]] and Colombian [[Tatiana Calder\u00f3n]] competed with the team for the [[2016 GP3 Series|2016 season]]. Calder\u00f3n being the first women to compete for the team in its 19-year history. With three victories from Dennis and Aitken, the team finished as runners-up to [[ART Grand Prix]] in the constructor's standings.\n\nIn January 2017, [[Niko Kari]] was signed to the team for the [[2017 GP3 Series|2017 season]], making him the first [[Red Bull Junior Team|Red Bull Junior]] to compete with the team since Kvyat and Sainz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.redbullcontentpool.com/international/AP-1QTMVSMJ51W11?linkId=3350424|title=Red Bull Juniors confirmed|date=18 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> A month later, [[Steijn Schothorst]] and [[2016 Euroformula Open Championship|Euroformula Open]] champion [[Leonardo Pulcini]] joined Arden.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/gp3/news/arden-completes-gp3-line-up-for-2017-871811/|title=Arden completes GP3 line-up for 2017|last=Gruz|first=David|date=7 February 2017|publisher=Motorsport.com|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n2018 line-up consisted of [[Gabriel Aubry (racing driver)|Gabriel Aubry]], [[Julien Falchero]] and [[Joey Mawson]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gruz|first1=David|title=Arden signs Aubry for maiden GP3 campaign|url=https://www.motorsport.com/gp3/news/arden-signs-aubry-for-maiden-gp3-campaign-998678/|accessdate=24 January 2018|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=24 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Peter|title=Arden adds Julien Falchero to 2018 GP3 line-up|url=http://www.formulascout.com/arden-adds-julien-falchero-to-2018-gp3-line-up/40574|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=formulascout.com|date=8 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Khorounzhiy|first1=Valentin|title=Mawson joins Arden for GP3 move|url=https://www.motorsport.com/gp3/news/mawson-f3-f4-arden-international-1007168/|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]|date=21 February 2018}}</ref> The team has season without wins, with just two podiums achieved by Mawson.\n\n===Formula Renault 3.5===\n\nFor [[2012 Formula Renault 3.5 Series|2012]], Arden International entered an agreement with [[Caterham]] to join the Formula Renault 3.5 series as a joint team known as '''Arden Caterham'''. For their first season, they signed former GP3 driver for '''MW Arden''' [[Lewis Williamson]], and one of [[Caterham F1]]'s test drivers, [[Alexander Rossi (racing driver)|Alexander Rossi]].\n\nRossi scored his first podium finish with a third-place finish at the one race round at Monaco. After 3 rounds, Williamson was dropped by the team and the [[Red Bull Junior Team|Red Bull Junior Driver Programme]] for failing to score a single point and was replaced by [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]] who had also replaced him at the Junior Programme too.

multiple formula racing team created and run by Christian Horner and Garry Horner, It currently runs teams in the [[Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0]] and [[FIA Formula 4|F4 British Championship]], and formerly ran in the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]] and [[GP3 Series]].\n\nIt has been competing since 1997 and has raced in the [[Formula 3000 International Championship]], the [[Auto GP|Italian Formula 3000 series]], and the [[A1 Grand Prix|A1 GP series]] for [[A1 Team Great Britain|Great Britain]].\n\nDue to the Arden's strong business connections and sponsorship, the team often signs [[Red Bull Junior Team]] drivers as a way to pave forward future F1 drivers. Many drivers have been Red Bull Juniors, including [[Michael Ammerm\u00fcller]], [[Neel Jani]], [[Filipe Albuquerque]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]], [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]], [[Daniil Kvyat]], [[Carlos Sainz, Jr.]], [[Dan Ticktum]], Jack Doohan and Dennis Hauger.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formula 3000===\nThe team was initially created as a vehicle to enable Christian Horner to race in F3000 in [[1997 International Formula 3000 season|1997]]. According to Horner he set the team up with borrowed money, including a loan from his father, and persuaded [[P1 Motorsport]] founder Roly Vincini (who Horner had driven for in his first season of F3) to take on the role of his race engineer. He bought a second-hand trailer for the team from [[Helmut Marko]], who as head of the [[Red Bull Junior Team]] was one of Horner's main rivals as a manager in F3000, and who he later worked closely with at Red Bull. He stayed in F3000 for 1998 and was joined at Arden by [[Kurt Mollekens]], who showed good pace and led the championship at one stage.<ref name=ms>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/january-2012/66/lunch-christian-horner |title=Lunch with... Christian Horner |last=Taylor |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Taylor (journalist) |date=January 2012|website=Motor Sport (magazine)|access-date=1 October 2016}}</ref> In the winter of 1998 family friend [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] had been approached by Russian oil company [[Lukoil]] to enable them to enter motorsports sponsorship. As entries to F3000 were restricted, Richards agreed a deal with Horner that [[Prodrive]] would take a 50% stake in Arden, in return for Horner becoming team manager. As a result, the team signed [[Viktor Maslov (racing driver)|Viktor Maslov]] as a driver under the Lukoil deal from [[1999 International Formula 3000 season|1999]]. The team started off poorly, and didn't have the pace to qualify for many races.\n\nAt the end of 1999, Richards sold a stake in Prodrive to [[Apax Partners]], who didn't want to continue in F3000. Horner hence exercised the option to buy back the Prodrive stake. As the years went on, the team began to reap the results and was the best team of Formula 3000 in its last 3 years, showing new talents to motorsport world like [[Darren Manning]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Wirdheim]] and [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]].\n\n[[File:Bjorn Wirdheim 2003 F3000 Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bj\u00f6rn Wirdheim]] in 2003 racing at Hungary]]\nThe team won the Teams' Championship in [[2002 International Formula 3000 season|2002]], [[2003 Formula 3000 season|2003]] and [[2004 Formula 3000 season|2004]]. During those years, Wirdheim won the drivers championship in 2003, and Liuzzi won it in 2004.\n\nDuring the teams 8 years in the series, it has scored 359 points, won 16 races and achieved 20 [[pole position]]s.\n\n===Italian Formula 3000===\nThe team joined the Italian Formula 3000 series for [[1999 Italian Formula 3000 season|1999]] and [[2000 Italian Formula 3000 season|2000]]. Their first season was poor with only one point to their name, but the 2000 season went significantly better, with [[Warren Hughes]] taking two wins, one pole position and three fastest laps for the team, and [[Darren Manning]] taking one win, one pole and one fastest lap too. The team finished with Hughes second in the championship, and the team winning it outright 51 points.\n\n===A1 GP===\nArden operated [[A1 Team Great Britain]] in the first season of the [[A1 Grand Prix|A1GP]] series for [[2005-06 A1 Grand Prix season|2005\u20132006]]. The team fared well in their first season, collecting 8 podium finishes and a single pole position, leaving the team 3rd in the championship with 97 points overall.\n\n===GP2===\nIn [[2005 GP2 Series|2005]], the F3000 series was rebranded as the GP2 Series, Arden stayed on for the new series and achieved second place in the teams' championship with [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Nicolas Lapierre]], and second place in the Drivers' Championship with Kovalainen, who had 5 wins, 4 pole positions and a fastest lap to his name.\n\n[[File:Yelmer Buurman 2008 GP2 Silverstone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yelmer Buurman]] driving at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].]]\n\nIn [[2006 GP2 Series|2006]], Arden competed in GP2 with Lapierre and the rookie [[Michael Ammerm\u00fcller]] ([[Neel Jani]] acted as a substitute for Lapierre when the latter was injured in the race at [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]]). This year, Arden suffered a significant drop in performance, and had only 57 points to show and a single win from Ammerm\u00fcller, compared to the previous season's 126. Overall the team came fourth in the championship.\n\nFor [[2007 GP2 Series|2007]], Arden signed [[Bruno Senna]], nephew of triple F1 champion [[Ayrton Senna]], and [[A1 Team South Africa]] driver [[Adrian Zaugg]]. Zaugg was replaced for the final round of the season by [[Filipe Albuquerque]]. This season was even worse for the team compared to the previous year, only managing 42 points which resulted in a seventh-placed finish in the teams' championship, with Senna finishing ninth overall in the drivers' championship.\n\nFor [[2008 GP2 Series|2008]] and the newly founded [[2008 GP2 Asia Series|Asia Series]], the team was renamed [[Trust (electronics)|Trust]] Team Arden, after its [[Netherlands|Dutch]] title sponsor [[Trust (electronics)|Trust]]. The duo of [[Red Bull Junior Team]] driver [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Yelmer Buurman]] was its race line-up for both championships. For the Asia Series, [[Adam Khan]] raced for the first two rounds before being replaced by Buurman. The overall result in the Asia Series was the team finishing second in the championship, with 50 points and one win, and Buemi finishing second in the drivers' championship. Mid-season in the main series, Buurman was replaced by [[ART Grand Prix]] outcast [[Luca Filippi]]. The season went slightly better than the previous one with the team picking up 50 points, enough to take sixth place, and Buemi picked up two race victories to finish sixth overall in the drivers' championship.\n\n[[File:Mortara + Nunes 2009 GP2 Turkey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edoardo Mortara|Mortara]] leading at the race in Turkey]]\n\nArden again took part in the Asia Series for the [[2008\u201309 GP2 Asia Series|2008\u201309 season]], signing [[Luiz Razia]] and [[Mika M\u00e4ki]]. For the second round of the championship, held at the [[Dubai Autodrome]], M\u00e4ki was replaced by [[Renger van der Zande]], who was subsequently replaced for the rest of the season by [[Edoardo Mortara]]. Razia scored the team's only win of the campaign, which allowed Arden to finish sixth in the teams' championship. For the [[2009 GP2 Series|2009 main Series]], the team signed F3 frontrunners [[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] and Mortara. This was also another poor season for the team, as it finished well down the order in eighth place overall with only Mortara managing a single win.\n\nFor the [[2009\u201310 GP2 Asia Series|2009\u201310]] Asia Series, Arden signed [[Charles Pic]] and [[Rodolfo Gonz\u00e1lez]]. After the first round, Gonz\u00e1lez was replaced by [[Javier Villa]] for the rest of the season. This was the team's most successful outing in the Asia Series, with an end result of 37 points and second in the teams' championship. Villa finished fourth overall in the drivers' championship with 19 points, and Pic finished fifth with a single race victory. For the [[2010 GP2 Series|2010 main series]], the team kept Pic and resigned Gonz\u00e1lez. However, the success from the Asia Series did not quite continue into the main series as the team eventually finished seventh with one win, courtesy of Pic. Arden finished with fewer points than in [[2009 GP2 Series|2009]], but still managed to beat the previous teams' championship result of eighth position.\n\n[[File:J Palmer Monza 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Jolyon Palmer]] driving at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in [[2011 GP2 Series|2011]].]]\n\nFor the [[2011 GP2 Asia Series]] and [[2011 GP2 Series|2011 GP2 Main Series]] seasons, the team signed [[Josef Kr\u00e1l]] and [[Jolyon Palmer]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://gp2series.com/News-Room/News/2011/01_Jan/Kral-and-Palmer-join-Arden-for-2011-GP2-season/ | title = KRAL AND PALMER JOIN ARDEN FOR 2011 GP2 SEASON | work = gp2series.com | date = 2011-01-26 | accessdate = 2011-01-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120711031306/http://gp2series.com/News-Room/News/2011/01_Jan/Kral-and-Palmer-join-Arden-for-2011-GP2-season/ | archivedate = 2012-07-11 }}</ref> The year was the team's worst so far in its GP2 history, as neither driver managed a win, pole or fastest lap in either series, and the team ended up finishing tenth in the Asia series and eleventh in the main series.\n\nAs the [[GP2 Asia Series]] had joined together with the [[GP2 Series|GP2 main series]] in 2012, there were no longer two separate series. The team signed former [[2008\u201309 GP2 Asia Series|2008\u201309 Asia season]] driver Luiz Razia and former MW Arden GP3 sister team driver [[Simon Trummer]] for the [[2012 GP2 Series|2012]] season. Razia won the feature race of the first round in [[Sepang International Circuit|Malaysia]], picked up two 2nd-place finishes during the two [[Bahrain International Circuit|Bahrain]] rounds, and won again at [[Circuit de Catalunya|Catalunya]], [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. He finished the season as runner-up to champion [[Davide Valsecchi]], whilst Trummer had a best race finish of seventh place to take 23rd in the drivers' championship. Arden finished third in the team's championship; its best result since 2005.\n\nFrom there Arden struggled in subsequent GP2 Series, their highest constructor's finish being an eighth in [[2013 GP2 Series|2013]], and went without a win till the end of the series under the GP2 moniker.\n\n===GP3===\nFrom [[2010 GP3 Series|2010]] onwards, they have operated a [[GP3 Series]] team with [[Mark Webber]], the team was called MW Arden.\n\nThe team signed [[Michael Christensen (racing driver)|Michael Christensen]], [[Miki Monr\u00e1s]] and [[Leonardo Cordeiro]] for their debut season. Their first venture into the new series proved difficult as they only accumulate 18 points for the whole season with 2 fastest laps, leaving them 9th in the championship.\n\nFor [[2011 GP3 Series|2011]], the team completely refreshed their line up by signing [[Mitch Evans]], [[Simon Trummer]] and [[Lewis Williamson]]. The season overshadowed the previous as the team came second overall in the constructors championship with 69 points, and both Williamson and Evans scoring 1 win each and coming 8th and 9th in the drivers championship respectively. This would also be the season where the team picked up its first pole positions with 2 from Evans and 1 from Williamson.\n\nFor [[2012 GP3 Series|2012]], they retained Evans, and partnered him with [[David Fumanelli]] and [[Matias Laine]].

It took place among the [[Aegates Islands]], off the western coast of the island of [[Sicily]]. The Carthaginians were commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], and the Romans were under the overall authority of [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], but [[Quintus Valerius Falto]] commanded during the battle. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.\n\nThe Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as [[marines]]. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet, which was further handicapped by being laden with supplies and having not yet embarked its full complement of marines.\n\nAs a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Lutatius]], by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial [[War reparations|reparations]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.{{sfn|Royal|Tusa|2019|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n==Background==\n===Operations in Sicily===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC, the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River [[Arno]] had recently been [[Roman expansion in Italy|unified under Roman control]]. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n===Ships===\n\nDuring this period the standard Mediterranean warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100 [[tonne]]s (110 [[short tons]]; 100 [[long tons]]). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested that they could maintain 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Average speeds of 5\u20136 knots (6\u20137 mph; 9\u201311 kph) were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=283}}\n\nVessels were built as cataphract, or \"protected\", ships, with a closed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}} The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets \u2013 or files \u2013 of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=101}}\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a [[trireme]]|{{center|Depiction of the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek trireme}}]]\n\nThe Romans had little prior naval experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their Latin or Greek allies.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}}In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and thus slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], although [[hexareme]]s (six oarsmen per bank), [[quadriremes]] (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So [[wikt:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines;{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline.

Skill was required to impact an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one's own galley in the stricken enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship on ship combats which have been likened to aerial [[dogfight]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===264\u2013250 BC===\n\nLargely because of the Romans' invention of the {{lang|la|[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]}}, a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] (260 BC), [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] (257 BC), [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] (256 BC) and [[Battle of Cape Hermaea|Cape Hermaeum]] (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the {{lang|la|corvus}} may have contributed to this disaster.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} In any event, they did not use the {{lang|la|corvus}} thereafter.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=86}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nThe Carthaginians regained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories over the blockading Roman fleet at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122}} The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission most of her navy.

[[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]] was put in charge of operations in Africa in 248 BC and went on to conquer considerable territory by 248 BC. The historian Nigel Bagnall considers that during this period Carthage viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nBy 248 BC, the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome had gained control of most of Sicily{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} and the Carthaginians retained only two cities on the island: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} \n\nWhen [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]] from his base at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\nEarly in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie 15\u201340 km (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements{{snd}}either 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sources{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}}{{snd}}and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=117}} The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]]; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by [[blockade runner]]s. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nBy 243 BC, after more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-[[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\n==New Roman fleet==\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the [[Roman Senate]] decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}}{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], assisted by the [[praetor]] [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=123\u2013124}} Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became [[proconsul]] and [[Promagistrate|propraetor]] respectively.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=152}}{{sfn|Smith|1870|pp=135, 138}}\n \nThe garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepana{{snd}}and Hamilcar's army at Eryx{{snd}}held fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Aegades241a.png|thumb|upright=1.35|{{center|The course of the battle}}|alt=A map showing the movements of both fleets during the battle]]\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]]; he is distinguished from the other Hanno's by being known as the son of Hannibal. This is possibly the general who had lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battles of Agrigentum]] and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=153}} The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a [[Following sea|following]] wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargoes, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade and took on board his 200 quinqueremes a full complement of marines from the soldiers of the besieging Roman army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa, {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} Hanno immediately set sail for Lilybaeum. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Hamilcar Barca and Lilybaeum. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}} Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}}\n[[File:Q.

The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar's soldiers.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=195\u2013196}} It was the first time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the {{lang|la|corvus}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships' greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. The Romans sank 50 Carthaginian ships, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with up to 10,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=271}} However, the battle was hard fought, with the Romans losing 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore to save weight and so were unable to pursue.

Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nHenceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.

It took place among the [[Aegates Islands]], off the western coast of the island of [[Sicily]]. The Carthaginians were commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], and the Romans were under the overall authority of [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], but [[Quintus Valerius Falto]] commanded during the battle. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.\n\nThe Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as [[marines]]. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet, which was further handicapped by being laden with supplies and having not yet embarked its full complement of marines.\n\nAs a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Lutatius]], by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial [[War reparations|reparations]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.{{sfn|Royal|Tusa|2019|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n==Background==\n===Operations in Sicily===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC, the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River [[Arno]] had recently been [[Roman expansion in Italy|unified under Roman control]]. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]).

The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested that they could maintain 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Average speeds of 5\u20136 knots (6\u20137 mph; 9\u201311 kph) were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=283}}\n\nVessels were built as cataphract, or \"protected\", ships, with a closed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers.

Skill was required to impact an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one's own galley in the stricken enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship on ship combats which have been likened to aerial [[dogfight]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===264\u2013250 BC===\n\nLargely because of the Romans' invention of the {{lang|la|[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]}}, a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] (260 BC), [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] (257 BC), [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] (256 BC) and [[Battle of Cape Hermaea|Cape Hermaeum]] (255 BC).

Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]] from his base at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], north of Drepana.

Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements{{snd}}either 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sources{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}}{{snd}}and a large quantity of supplies.

These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew.

Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises.

It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=153}} The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands.

They would then unload their cargoes, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa.

She was created by [[Jason Latour]] and Robbi Rodriguez. The character debuted in ''[[Edge of Spider-Verse]]'' #2 as part of the 2014\u201315 \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" [[comic book]] storyline, leading to the ongoing series ''[[Spider-Gwen]]'' that began in 2015.\n\nSpider-Woman is a [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|variant]] of [[Spider-Man]] and an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe version]] of Gwen Stacy.

The character's various enemies include Earth-65 versions of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]]. Gwen Stacy's Spider-Woman harbors much of Peter's personality and conflicts along with his powers and abilities.\n\nSpider-Woman was met with positive reviews from critics, with them applauding her design\u2014cited as a popular choice for [[cosplay]]\u2014and a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective.

Murdock and scientist Elsa Brock eventually found a way for Gwen to regain her powers and rid her friend Harry Osborn of the Lizard serum by combining the serum with the isotopes to form the Venom symbiote. She succeeds and ends up bonding to the symbiote, but Murdock allowed Rhino to beat George up in prison after she refused to turn Harry over to the Hand. This caused her to succumb to the symbiote's influence and she began brutally attacking the Hand and other criminals. After realizing how far she was taking it, she revealed her secret identity to the Parkers and her band mates. Ben encouraged Gwen to take revenge on Murdock and she almost succeeded in killing him, but decided against it after finding out that Murdock was testing to see if she could be corrupted by power as he was. The dimensional teleportation device Murdock stole from Gwen then sent her to Earth-617, a reality similar to Earth-616 prior to that Gwen's death. This universe's Gwen helps her with creating a portal back to her own dimension and makes her realize how lucky she is to have her dad still alive. Shortly after returning, she finally defeated Murdock, took full control over the symbiote, revealed her secret identity to the public, and was convicted for one year in a maximum security S.H.I.E.L.D. prison, despite an offer by Captain America to join a black ops team to reduce her sentences.<ref>''Spider-Gwen Vol. 2'' #10-34</ref>\n\n===Ghost-Spider===\nAfter finishing her prison sentence, Gwen tried to return to her normal life of superhero activities, drumming with the Mary Janes, and attempting to rekindle her relationships with Harry and her father. However, it proved to be challenging since she no longer had a secret identity, resulting in being treated either warmly or disdainfully by a number of people in public, as well as attacks by many criminals like the [[Man-Wolf]] against her and her associates. Additionally, her symbiote started acting up and gave her massive headaches while dropping gummy spiders everywhere. Since the symbiote's creator, Elsa Brock, has disappeared from the public, she uses her dimension hopping device to travel to Earth-616 to find Elsa's counterpart, [[Eddie Brock]] aka Venom. She runs into Earth-616 Peter Parker, who volunteers to analyze the symbiote at Empire State University for her. During her visit, she realizes that her secret identity is still intact in this dimension and decides to use it to her advantage. She starts calling herself \"Ghost-Spider\" (since she believes \"death loves Gwen Stacy\") and enrolls in Earth-616's Empire State University to get a college education somewhere where she's not a celebrity.<ref>''Spider-Gwen: Ghost Spider Vol. 1'' #1-10</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\nSpider-Gwen is depicted as a recurring protagonist in the \"[[Spider-Verse]]\" storyline.

Shortly after she begins fighting crime, one of her classmates, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him in Midtown High School, becoming Earth-65's version of the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].

Murdock and scientist Elsa Brock eventually found a way for Gwen to regain her powers and rid her friend Harry Osborn of the Lizard serum by combining the serum with the isotopes to form the Venom symbiote. She succeeds and ends up bonding to the symbiote, but Murdock allowed Rhino to beat George up in prison after she refused to turn Harry over to the Hand. This caused her to succumb to the symbiote's influence and she began brutally attacking the Hand and other criminals. After realizing how far she was taking it, she revealed her secret identity to the Parkers and her band mates. Ben encouraged Gwen to take revenge on Murdock and she almost succeeded in killing him, but decided against it after finding out that Murdock was testing to see if she could be corrupted by power as he was. The dimensional teleportation device Murdock stole from Gwen then sent her to Earth-617, a reality similar to Earth-616 prior to that Gwen's death. This universe's Gwen helps her with creating a portal back to her own dimension and makes her realize how lucky she is to have her dad still alive. Shortly after returning, she finally defeated Murdock, took full control over the symbiote, revealed her secret identity to the public, and was convicted for one year in a maximum security S.H.I.E.L.D. prison, despite an offer by Captain America to join a black ops team to reduce her sentences.<ref>''Spider-Gwen Vol. 2'' #10-34</ref>\n\n===Ghost-Spider===\nAfter finishing her prison sentence, Gwen tried to return to her normal life of superhero activities, drumming with the Mary Janes, and attempting to rekindle her relationships with Harry and her father. However, it proved to be challenging since she no longer had a secret identity, resulting in being treated either warmly or disdainfully by a number of people in public, as well as attacks by many criminals like the [[Man-Wolf]] against her and her associates. Additionally, her symbiote started acting up and gave her massive headaches while dropping gummy spiders everywhere. Since the symbiote's creator, Elsa Brock, has disappeared from the public, she uses her dimension hopping device to travel to Earth-616 to find Elsa's counterpart, [[Eddie Brock]] aka Venom. She runs into Earth-616 Peter Parker, who volunteers to analyze the symbiote at Empire State University for her. During her visit, she realizes that her secret identity is still intact in this dimension and decides to use it to her advantage.

A moderate [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]], who sought to reconcile the sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland society, he was Member of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] for the [[Bannside (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Bannside constituency]] from 1946 until his forced resignation in April 1969 as communal conflict erupted; his successor in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] was [[Ian Paisley]], while control of the UUP also passed to more hard-line elements.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:O'Neill Conroy family tree.jpg|thumb|O'Neill Conroy family tree]]\n\nTerence O'Neill was born on 10 September 1914 at 29 [[Ennismore Gardens]], [[Hyde Park, London]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref> He was the youngest son of Lady Annabel Hungerford Crewe-Milnes (daughter of [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe]]) and Captain [[Arthur O'Neill]] of [[Shane's Castle]], [[Randalstown]], the first member of parliament (MP) to be killed in action during the [[First World War]]. The family assumed the surname O'Neill by royal licence in lieu of their original name Chichester. The Chichester's trace their lineage to the name O'Neill through Mary Chichester, daughter of Henry O'Neill of Shane's Castle.{{cn|date=December 2019}} O'Neill's younger half-brother was [[Quentin Crewe]].\n\nO'Neill grew up in London and was educated at [[West Downs School]], [[Winchester]] and [[Eton College]]. He spent summer holidays in [[Ulster]]. Following school he spent a year in [[France]] and [[Germany]] and then worked in the [[City of London]] and [[Australia]]. In May 1940 he received a commission at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and went on to serve in the [[6th Guards Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Guards Tank Brigade]] during the [[Second World War]], in which both of his brothers died. Like many other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] politicians, the rank he held during the war followed him into his political career, hence \"[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]\" Terence O'Neill.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.27\">McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.27</ref>\n\nOn 4 February 1944 he married [[Jean O'Neill|Katharine Jean]],<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2494952/Lady-ONeill-of-the-Maine.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Lady O'Neill of the Maine | date=3 August 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref> the daughter of William Ingham Whitaker, of Pylewell Park, Lymington, [[Hampshire]]. They had one son, Patrick (b. 1945), and one daughter, Anne (b. 1947).\n\nLike all Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland, he was a member of the [[Orange Order]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-18769781 | title=Who are the Orangemen?| work=BBC News| date=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nAt the end of 1945, O'Neill and his family went to live in [[Northern Ireland]] in a converted Regency rectory near [[Ahoghill]], [[County Antrim]]. In a by-election in 1946, he was elected as the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) MP for the [[Bannside (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Bannside]] constituency in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], which sat at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]]. O'Neill served in a series of junior positions. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Local Government from February 1948 until November 1953, when he was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]]. In 1953 he served as [[High Sheriff of Antrim]].<ref>{{ London Gazette | city = b | issue = 1645 |page=2 | date = 2 January 1953 }}</ref> He was elevated to Cabinet level in the [[Government of Northern Ireland (1921-1972)|Government of Northern Ireland]] in April 1956 when he was made [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Home Affairs]] and sworn into the [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland]]. Six months later he was also appointed as [[Minister of Finance (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Finance]], a senior portfolio that he administered alongside Home Affairs until he divested the latter to focus on Finance. He remained Minister of Finance until his appointment as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in 1963.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=Marc|title='O'Neill, Terence Marne, Baron O'Neill of the Maine (1914-1990)|volume=1|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39857?docPos=1|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=15 April 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/39857|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister==\nIn 1963, O'Neill succeeded [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough]] as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He introduced new policies that would have been unthinkable with Lord Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism and to bring Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.27\"/> O'Neill seemed to strongly believe in industrialisation and modernisation. However it is clear that he was in some ways trying to prevent the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (NILP) from gaining ground.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.29\">McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.29</ref> Northern Ireland was influenced by British politics so the arrival of [[Harold Wilson]] in [[Downing Street]] meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O'Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.29\"/>\n\nAs O'Neill promoted industrialisation and modernisation, [[Taoiseach]] [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] was doing similar things in the [[Republic of Ireland]], thus leading to the first real rapprochement between the two jurisdictions since [[Partition of Ireland|partition]].<ref>McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.30</ref> In January 1965, O'Neill invited the Taoiseach for talks in [[Belfast]]. O'Neill met with strong opposition from his own party, having informed very few of the visit, and from [[Ian Paisley]], who rejected any dealings with the Republic. Paisley and his followers threw snowballs at Lemass' car during the visit. In February, O'Neill visited Lemass in [[Dublin]]. Opposition to O'Neill's reforms was so strong that in 1967 [[George Forrest (Northern Ireland politician)|George Forrest]] \u2013 the MP for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster]], who supported the Prime Minister \u2013 was pulled off the platform at the [[The Twelfth|Twelfth of July]] celebrations in [[Coagh]], [[County Tyrone]], and kicked unconscious by fellow members of the Orange Order.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/dmu.htm Mid-Ulster 1950-1970]</ref>\n\nIn December 1967, Lemass' successor [[Jack Lynch]] travelled to [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] for his first meeting with O'Neill. On 8 January 1968, they met again in Dublin.  On 19 January 1968, O'Neill made a speech marking five years in office to members of the [[Irish Association]], calling for \"a new endeavour by organisations in Northern Ireland to cross denominational barriers and advance the cause of better community relations\".  On 20 May 1968, O'Neill was pelted with eggs, flour and stones by members of the [[Woodvale, Belfast|Woodvale]] Unionist Association<ref name=\"CA\">{{cite web | title=A Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 1968 | work=Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)| url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch68.htm | accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref> who disapproved of his policies.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) began street demonstrations. The march across [[Derry]] on 5 October 1968, banned by [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]] the [[Minister of Home Affairs]], was met with violence from the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) who used batons on protesters, among whom were prominent politicians. The O'Neill government was unable to deal with the disturbances, so Harold Wilson summoned O'Neill to Downing Street.<ref>McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p. 42</ref> The Stormont cabinet minutes from 14 October show O'Neill recalling his time in Britain.  He stated that Wilson had threatened to take over if O'Neill could not manage to gain control. Finally he concluded that if they couldn't manage it politically then they would be forced into a period of governance by police power alone.<ref>McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.43</ref> The police violence was filmed by [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television and broadcast worldwide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cathcart|first=Rex|title=The Most Contrary Region|year=1984|publisher=The Blackstaff Press|isbn=978-0856403231|pages=208}}</ref> The date of this march is taken by some historians as being the start of the Northern Ireland [[The Troubles|Troubles]].\n\nIn response to these events, O'Neill introduced a [[Five Point Reform Programme]].  This granted a number of the concessions that NICRA had demanded but importantly it did not include [[one man one vote]] in local government council elections. Despite this the NICRA felt it had made some ground and agreed to postpone its marches. While things were expected to improve, many Catholics felt let down by the limited reforms.  A group was formed by university-based activists including [[Bernadette Devlin]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]], named [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]], which began a four-day march from [[Belfast]] to Derry on 1 January 1969. On the fourth day, the march was attacked during the [[Burntollet Bridge incident]] by around 200 hardline [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]]. Although many RUC men were present during the attack none intervened. It later emerged that some of the assailants were in fact off-duty policemen. Many marchers were injured, 13 requiring hospital treatment. The Burntollet attack sparked several [[Battle of the Bogside|days of rioting]] between the RUC and Catholic protesters in the [[Bogside]] area of Derry.\n\nIn February 1969, O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|surprise general election]] because of the turmoil inside the UUP, after twelve dissident MPs signed a motion of no confidence against O'Neill, and [[Brian Faulkner]] resigned from the Government following its appointment of the [[John Cameron, Lord Cameron|Cameron Commission]]. Although pro-O'Neill candidates won a plurality of seats in the general election, O'Neill lost an overall majority among UUP MP's in order to pass his reforms through Parliament.\n\n==Resignation==\nFrom O'Neill's point of view, the 1969 general election was inconclusive. He was humiliated by his near-defeat in his own constituency of Bannside by [[Ian Paisley]] and resigned as leader of the UUP and as Prime Minister on 28 April 1969 after a series of bomb explosions on Belfast's water supply by the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) brought his personal political crisis to a head.\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' published on 10 May 1969 he stated: \"It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants that if you give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets; they will refuse to have eighteen children. But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church\".<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ton10569.htm Online  quotation accessed 14-1-2009]</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nHe retired from Stormont politics in January 1970 when he resigned his seat, having become the [[Father of the House]] in the previous year. On 23 January 1970, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron O'Neill of the Maine''', of [[Ahoghill]] in the [[County of Antrim]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=45025 |date=23 January 1970 |page=957}}</ref> (The [[River Main (County Antrim)|Maine]] (or Main) is a river which flows near Ahoghill.)\n\nHe spent his last years at Lisle Court, [[Lymington]], Hampshire, although he continued to speak on the problems of Northern Ireland in the [[House of Lords]] where he sat as a cross-bencher. He appeared on the [[BBC]] Election Night programme in October 1974, where he clashed with the newly elected Ulster Unionist Party MP for South Down, [[Enoch Powell]], over Northern Ireland's politics.<ref>Film of the exchange, 'Enoch Powell after election victory in 1974', published on Youtube 19 January 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS9-_CKhGSE</ref> His Reform Policies are largely forgotten by British Unionists and Irish Nationalists in Northern Ireland; however, he is remembered by historians for his efforts to reform the discrimination and sectarianism within the region during the 1960s. In retirement he was also a trustee of the [[Winston Churchill Memorial Trust]].\n\n==Death==\nHe died at his home of cancer on 12 June 1990. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter. His estate was valued at \u00a3443,043,<ref>probate, 28 August 1990, [[CGPLA England and Wales]]</ref>.\n\n==Arms==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image = [[File:Coronet of a British Baron.svg|centre|150px]][[File:O'Neill of the Maine Escutcheon.png|centre|200px]]\n|escutcheon = Quarterly: 1st and 4th, per fess wavy the Chief Argent and the base representing Waves of the Sea in chief a Dexter Hand couped at the wrist Gules in base a Salmon naiant proper (O'Neill); 2nd and 3rd, checky Or and Gules a Chief Vair (Chichester)\n|crest = 1st, an Arm embowed in Armour the Hand grasping a Sword all proper; 2nd, a Stork rising with a Snake in its beak all proper\n|supporters = Dexter: a Lion Gules gorged with an Eastern Crown Argent pendent therefrom by a Chain Gold an Escutcheon charged with the Arms of O'Neill as in the Arms; Sinister: a Horse Argent collared gemel resting the interior hind foot on a Mascle Azure\n|motto = Invitum Sequitur Honos (Honours follow us without asking); Lamh Dearg E'rin (The Red Hand of Ireland) <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lp1958%20o.htm | title=Life Peerages - O}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

A moderate [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]], who sought to reconcile the sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland society, he was Member of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] for the [[Bannside (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Bannside constituency]] from 1946 until his forced resignation in April 1969 as communal conflict erupted; his successor in the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] was [[Ian Paisley]], while control of the UUP also passed to more hard-line elements.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:O'Neill Conroy family tree.jpg|thumb|O'Neill Conroy family tree]]\n\nTerence O'Neill was born on 10 September 1914 at 29 [[Ennismore Gardens]], [[Hyde Park, London]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref> He was the youngest son of Lady Annabel Hungerford Crewe-Milnes (daughter of [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe]]) and Captain [[Arthur O'Neill]] of [[Shane's Castle]], [[Randalstown]], the first member of parliament (MP) to be killed in action during the [[First World War]]. The family assumed the surname O'Neill by royal licence in lieu of their original name Chichester. The Chichester's trace their lineage to the name O'Neill through Mary Chichester, daughter of Henry O'Neill of Shane's Castle.{{cn|date=December 2019}} O'Neill's younger half-brother was [[Quentin Crewe]].\n\nO'Neill grew up in London and was educated at [[West Downs School]], [[Winchester]] and [[Eton College]]. He spent summer holidays in [[Ulster]]. Following school he spent a year in [[France]] and [[Germany]] and then worked in the [[City of London]] and [[Australia]]. In May 1940 he received a commission at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and went on to serve in the [[6th Guards Tank Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Guards Tank Brigade]] during the [[Second World War]], in which both of his brothers died. Like many other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] politicians, the rank he held during the war followed him into his political career, hence \"[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]]\" Terence O'Neill.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.27\">McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.27</ref>\n\nOn 4 February 1944 he married Katharine Jean (16 January 1915&nbsp;\u201315 July 2008<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2494952/Lady-ONeill-of-the-Maine.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Lady O'Neill of the Maine | date=3 August 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>), the daughter of William Ingham Whitaker, of Pylewell Park, Lymington, [[Hampshire]]. They had one son, Patrick (b. 1945), and one daughter, Anne (b. 1947).\n\nLike all Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland, he was a member of the [[Orange Order]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-18769781 | title=Who are the Orangemen?| work=BBC News| date=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nAt the end of 1945, O'Neill and his family went to live in [[Northern Ireland]] in a converted Regency rectory near [[Ahoghill]], [[County Antrim]]. In a by-election in 1946, he was elected as the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) MP for the [[Bannside (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Bannside]] constituency in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], which sat at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]]. O'Neill served in a series of junior positions. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Local Government from February 1948 until November 1953, when he was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]]. In 1953 he served as [[High Sheriff of Antrim]].<ref>{{ London Gazette | city = b | issue = 1645 |page=2 | date = 2 January 1953 }}</ref> He was elevated to Cabinet level in the [[Government of Northern Ireland (1921-1972)|Government of Northern Ireland]] in April 1956 when he was made [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Home Affairs]] and sworn into the [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland]]. Six months later he was also appointed as [[Minister of Finance (Northern Ireland)|Minister of Finance]], a senior portfolio that he administered alongside Home Affairs until he divested the latter to focus on Finance. He remained Minister of Finance until his appointment as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in 1963.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=Marc|title='O'Neill, Terence Marne, Baron O'Neill of the Maine (1914-1990)|volume=1|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39857?docPos=1|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=15 April 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/39857|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister==\nIn 1963, O'Neill succeeded [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough]] as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He introduced new policies that would have been unthinkable with Lord Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism and to bring Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.27\"/> O'Neill seemed to strongly believe in industrialisation and modernisation. However it is clear that he was in some ways trying to prevent the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (NILP) from gaining ground.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.29\">McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.29</ref> Northern Ireland was influenced by British politics so the arrival of [[Harold Wilson]] in [[Downing Street]] meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O'Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government.<ref name=\"McKittrick, David 2002 p.29\"/>\n\nAs O'Neill promoted industrialisation and modernisation, [[Taoiseach]] [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] was doing similar things in the [[Republic of Ireland]], thus leading to the first real rapprochement between the two jurisdictions since [[Partition of Ireland|partition]].<ref>McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.30</ref> In January 1965, O'Neill invited the Taoiseach for talks in [[Belfast]]. O'Neill met with strong opposition from his own party, having informed very few of the visit, and from [[Ian Paisley]], who rejected any dealings with the Republic. Paisley and his followers threw snowballs at Lemass' car during the visit. In February, O'Neill visited Lemass in [[Dublin]]. Opposition to O'Neill's reforms was so strong that in 1967 [[George Forrest (Northern Ireland politician)|George Forrest]] \u2013 the MP for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster]], who supported the Prime Minister \u2013 was pulled off the platform at the [[The Twelfth|Twelfth of July]] celebrations in [[Coagh]], [[County Tyrone]], and kicked unconscious by fellow members of the Orange Order.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/dmu.htm Mid-Ulster 1950-1970]</ref>\n\nIn December 1967, Lemass' successor [[Jack Lynch]] travelled to [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] for his first meeting with O'Neill. On 8 January 1968, they met again in Dublin.  On 19 January 1968, O'Neill made a speech marking five years in office to members of the [[Irish Association]], calling for \"a new endeavour by organisations in Northern Ireland to cross denominational barriers and advance the cause of better community relations\".  On 20 May 1968, O'Neill was pelted with eggs, flour and stones by members of the [[Woodvale, Belfast|Woodvale]] Unionist Association<ref name=\"CA\">{{cite web | title=A Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 1968 | work=Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN)| url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch68.htm | accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref> who disapproved of his policies.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) began street demonstrations. The march across [[Derry]] on 5 October 1968, banned by [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]] the [[Minister of Home Affairs]], was met with violence from the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) who used batons on protesters, among whom were prominent politicians. The O'Neill government was unable to deal with the disturbances, so Harold Wilson summoned O'Neill to Downing Street.<ref>McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p. 42</ref> The Stormont cabinet minutes from 14 October show O'Neill recalling his time in Britain.  He stated that Wilson had threatened to take over if O'Neill could not manage to gain control. Finally he concluded that if they couldn't manage it politically then they would be forced into a period of governance by police power alone.<ref>McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), ''Making Sense of The Troubles'', Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.43</ref> The police violence was filmed by [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television and broadcast worldwide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cathcart|first=Rex|title=The Most Contrary Region|year=1984|publisher=The Blackstaff Press|isbn=978-0856403231|pages=208}}</ref> The date of this march is taken by some historians as being the start of the Northern Ireland [[The Troubles|Troubles]].\n\nIn response to these events, O'Neill introduced a [[Five Point Reform Programme]].  This granted a number of the concessions that NICRA had demanded but importantly it did not include [[one man one vote]] in local government council elections. Despite this the NICRA felt it had made some ground and agreed to postpone its marches. While things were expected to improve, many Catholics felt let down by the limited reforms.  A group was formed by university-based activists including [[Bernadette Devlin]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]], named [[People's Democracy (Ireland)|People's Democracy]], which began a four-day march from [[Belfast]] to Derry on 1 January 1969. On the fourth day, the march was attacked during the [[Burntollet Bridge incident]] by around 200 hardline [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]]. Although many RUC men were present during the attack none intervened. It later emerged that some of the assailants were in fact off-duty policemen. Many marchers were injured, 13 requiring hospital treatment. The Burntollet attack sparked several [[Battle of the Bogside|days of rioting]] between the RUC and Catholic protesters in the [[Bogside]] area of Derry.\n\nIn February 1969, O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election|surprise general election]] because of the turmoil inside the UUP, after twelve dissident MPs signed a motion of no confidence against O'Neill, and [[Brian Faulkner]] resigned from the Government following its appointment of the [[John Cameron, Lord Cameron|Cameron Commission]]. Although pro-O'Neill candidates won a plurality of seats in the general election, O'Neill lost an overall majority among UUP MP's in order to pass his reforms through Parliament.\n\n==Resignation==\nFrom O'Neill's point of view, the 1969 general election was inconclusive. He was humiliated by his near-defeat in his own constituency of Bannside by [[Ian Paisley]] and resigned as leader of the UUP and as Prime Minister on 28 April 1969 after a series of bomb explosions on Belfast's water supply by the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) brought his personal political crisis to a head.\n\nIn an interview with the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' published on 10 May 1969 he stated: \"It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants that if you give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets; they will refuse to have eighteen children. But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church\".<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ton10569.htm Online  quotation accessed 14-1-2009]</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nHe retired from Stormont politics in January 1970 when he resigned his seat, having become the [[Father of the House]] in the previous year. On 23 January 1970, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron O'Neill of the Maine''', of [[Ahoghill]] in the [[County of Antrim]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=45025 |date=23 January 1970 |page=957}}</ref> (The [[River Main (County Antrim)|Maine]] (or Main) is a river which flows near Ahoghill.)\n\nHe spent his last years at Lisle Court, [[Lymington]], Hampshire, although he continued to speak on the problems of Northern Ireland in the [[House of Lords]] where he sat as a cross-bencher. He appeared on the [[BBC]] Election Night programme in October 1974, where he clashed with the newly elected Ulster Unionist Party MP for South Down, [[Enoch Powell]], over Northern Ireland's politics.<ref>Film of the exchange, 'Enoch Powell after election victory in 1974', published on Youtube 19 January 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS9-_CKhGSE</ref> His Reform Policies are largely forgotten by British Unionists and Irish Nationalists in Northern Ireland; however, he is remembered by historians for his efforts to reform the discrimination and sectarianism within the region during the 1960s. In retirement he was also a trustee of the [[Winston Churchill Memorial Trust]].\n\n==Death==\nHe died at his home of cancer on 12 June 1990. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter. His estate was valued at \u00a3443,043,<ref>probate, 28 August 1990, [[CGPLA England and Wales]]</ref>.\n\n==Arms==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image = [[File:Coronet of a British Baron.svg|centre|150px]][[File:O'Neill of the Maine Escutcheon.png|centre|200px]]\n|escutcheon = Quarterly: 1st and 4th, per fess wavy the Chief Argent and the base representing Waves of the Sea in chief a Dexter Hand couped at the wrist Gules in base a Salmon naiant proper (O'Neill); 2nd and 3rd, checky Or and Gules a Chief Vair (Chichester)\n|crest = 1st, an Arm embowed in Armour the Hand grasping a Sword all proper; 2nd, a Stork rising with a Snake in its beak all proper\n|supporters = Dexter: a Lion Gules gorged with an Eastern Crown Argent pendent therefrom by a Chain Gold an Escutcheon charged with the Arms of O'Neill as in the Arms; Sinister: a Horse Argent collared gemel resting the interior hind foot on a Mascle Azure\n|motto = Invitum Sequitur Honos (Honours follow us without asking); Lamh Dearg E'rin (The Red Hand of Ireland) <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/lp1958%20o.htm | title=Life Peerages - O}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
