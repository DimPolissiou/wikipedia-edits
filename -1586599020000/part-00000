Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]]. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business,<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=McAllester|first=James|id=A150032b|title=Kingsbury, Bruce Steel (1918\u20131942) |publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|year=2000|accessdate=7 March 2009}}</ref> a job he disliked.<ref name=Dornan1 />\n\nUnhappy in the estate agency, Kingsbury took up the position of caretaker on a farm at [[Boundary Bend, Victoria|Boundary Bend]], not far from where Avery was working.

Serving initially in the Middle East, he later gained renown for his actions during the [[Battle of Isurava]], one of many battles forming the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokoda Track Campaign]] in the south-east of the island of [[New Guinea]], then part of the Australian [[Territory of Papua]] (now Papua New Guinea) . His bravery during the battle was recognised with the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest decoration for gallantry \"in the face of the enemy\" that can be awarded to members of the British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces. The first serviceman to [[List of Australian Victoria Cross recipients|receive]] the VC for actions on Australian territory, Kingsbury was a member of the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]].\n\nOn 29 August 1942, during the Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury was one of the few survivors of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] from the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then shot by a sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury was the second son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n\u00e9e Steel.<ref name=adb /> Growing up in [[Prahran]], Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billy carts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends.<ref name=Dornan1>{{Harvnb|Dornan|1999|pp=11\u201318}}</ref> Kingsbury attended [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] State School as a child, and his results were good enough to earn a scholarship at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]].

It is composed of a single village, Cs\u00edkszentdomokos.\n\n==Demographics==\nAt the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 6,110; out of them, 97% were [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], 1.4% were [[Romani people|Roma]] and 0.4% were [[Romanians|Romanian]].<ref>[http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ Tab8.

The mountain pass to the northwest, leading to the village of [[Izvorul Mure\u0219ului]] ({{lang-hu|Marosf\u0151}}) and on to the large town of [[Gheorgheni]], marks the northern boundary of the traditional region of [[Felcs\u00edk]].\n\nThe northern reaches of the village follow the descent of the river Olt to the village centre. Within the village limits, the Lok and Sz\u00e1dak\u00fat brooks meet the river, which then flows south to the village of [[Tome\u0219ti, Harghita|Tome\u015fti]]. In 1967, the northern village of [[B\u0103lan]], long a part of the commune but by then more populous than the central village, gained official town status and was separated from S\u00e2ndominic; however, the two settlements still share important economic and transport links.\n\nThe village is served by the ''Izvorul Olt'' station of [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|Romanian State Railways]], on the [[Ocna Mure\u0219|R\u0103zboieni]]-[[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]-Deda-[[Miercurea Ciuc]]-[[Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe]]-[[Bra\u0219ov]] line.\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of Sz\u00e9kely settlement on the site of S\u00e2ndominic in the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, the village was the site of iron and copper mining (a tradition carried on until very recently in B\u0103lan.) The name ''Zent Damokos'' appears in a document from 1567.<ref name=\"J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai\">{{cite web|author=J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai|title= Tekint\u0151 \u2013 Erd\u00e9lyi Helyn\u00e9vk\u00f6nyv|page=955}}[http://www.fatornyosfalunk.com/helynevkonyv_-_3._kotet_Q-ZS.pdf Transylvanian Toponym Book]</ref> The village gained notoriety for an incident of 3 November 1599 at the field of P\u00e1sztorb\u00fckk. On this day, Sz\u00e9kely irregulars, allied in the Long War with [[Michael the Brave]] ({{lang-ro|Mihai Viteazul}}) against the Hungarian nobility, killed the Cardinal [[B\u00e1thory Andr\u00e1s|Andr\u00e1s B\u00e1thory]], Prince of Transylvania, who was retreating to Poland after being defeated in the [[Battle of \u0218elimb\u0103r]]. The murderers were Mih\u00e1ly Andr\u00e1s Krist\u00e1ly and Bal\u00e1zs Nagy (later nicknamed Bal\u00e1zs \u00d6rd\u00f6g - 'Bal\u00e1zs the Devil') and they were executed for their deed. [[Pope Clement VIII]] responded by placing the whole village under [[interdict]]. A Memorial Cross was erected in 1816. Its location is at a distance of 5.5&nbsp;km north of town, on south-eastern slope of the hill ''Fagul Ciobanului'' (1108 m)\n\nThe village administratively belonged to [[Cs\u00edksz\u00e9k]], then, from 1876 until 1918 to the [[Cs\u00edk County]] of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, S\u00e2ndominic, like the rest of Transylvania, formally passed with the [[Treaty of Trianon]] from Hungarian to Romanian control. The region passed again to Hungary with the 1940 Treaty of the Belvedere (also known as the [[Second Vienna Award]]). In 1944, the village was the site of particularly bloody reprisals by Romanian irregulars participating in the recapture of Transylvania from this Hungarian control; a small monument in the village's central square bears witness to the 14 victims, among them an 86-year-old woman. After World War II, it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, it formed part of the [[Magyar Autonomous Region|Hungarian Autonomous Province]], then, of the Mure\u0219-Hungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968. Since then, the commune is part of Harghita County.\n\n==Religious sites and buildings==\n[[File:Csikszentdomokosi cinteremfal.jpg|thumb|left|St. Dominic Roman Catholic church]]\nS\u00e2ndominic's Roman Catholic church was constructed between 1787 and 1802, and still preserves numerous relics and treasures from the Middle Ages. A Greek Catholic church was completed in 1787, and there is also a small Romanian Orthodox church. Numerous chapels are scattered around the village, including the chapel at P\u00e1sztorb\u00fckk.\n\nA small village museum, containing historic farm equipment, costumes and weaponry, has been installed in the upper floor of the former House of Culture.

It lies in the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]], an ethno-cultural region in eastern [[Transylvania]]. It is composed of a single village, S\u00e2ndominic.\n\n==Demographics==\nAt the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 6,110; out of them, 97% were [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], 1.4% were [[Romani people|Roma]] and 0.4% were [[Romanians|Romanian]].<ref>[http://www.recensamantromania.ro/rezultate-2/ Tab8.

The mountain pass to the northwest, leading to the village of [[Izvorul Mure\u0219ului]] ({{lang-hu|Marosf\u0151}}) and on to the large town of [[Gheorgheni]], marks the northern boundary of the traditional region of [[Felcs\u00edk]].\n\nThe northern reaches of the village follow the descent of the river Olt to the village centre. Within the village limits, the Lok and Sz\u00e1dak\u00fat brooks meet the river, which then flows south to the village of [[Tome\u0219ti, Harghita|Tome\u015fti]]. In 1967, the northern village of [[B\u0103lan]], long a part of the commune but by then more populous than the central village, gained official town status and was separated from S\u00e2ndominic; however, the two settlements still share important economic and transport links.\n\nThe village is served by the ''Izvorul Olt'' station of [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|Romanian State Railways]], on the [[Ocna Mure\u0219|R\u0103zboieni]]-[[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]-Deda-[[Miercurea Ciuc]]-[[Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe]]-[[Bra\u0219ov]] line.\n\n==History==\nThere is evidence of Sz\u00e9kely settlement on the site of S\u00e2ndominic in the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, the village was the site of iron and copper mining (a tradition carried on until very recently in B\u0103lan.) The name ''Zent Damokos'' appears in a document from 1567.<ref name=\"J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai\">{{cite web|author=J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai|title= Tekint\u0151 \u2013 Erd\u00e9lyi Helyn\u00e9vk\u00f6nyv|page=955}}[http://www.fatornyosfalunk.com/helynevkonyv_-_3._kotet_Q-ZS.pdf Transylvanian Toponym Book]</ref> The village gained notoriety for an incident of 3 November 1599 at the field of P\u00e1sztorb\u00fckk. On this day, Sz\u00e9kely irregulars, allied in the Long War with [[Michael the Brave]] ({{lang-ro|Mihai Viteazul}}) against the Hungarian nobility, killed the Cardinal [[B\u00e1thory Andr\u00e1s|Andr\u00e1s B\u00e1thory]], Prince of Transylvania, who was retreating to Poland after being defeated in the [[Battle of \u0218elimb\u0103r]]. The murderers were Mih\u00e1ly Andr\u00e1s Krist\u00e1ly and Bal\u00e1zs Nagy (later nicknamed Bal\u00e1zs \u00d6rd\u00f6g - 'Bal\u00e1zs the Devil') and they were executed for their deed. [[Pope Clement VIII]] responded by placing the whole village under [[interdict]]. A Memorial Cross was erected in 1816. Its location is at a distance of 5.5&nbsp;km north of town, on south-eastern slope of the hill ''Fagul Ciobanului'' (1108 m)\n\nThe village administratively belonged to [[Cs\u00edksz\u00e9k]], then, from 1876 until 1918 to the [[Cs\u00edk County]] of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, S\u00e2ndominic, like the rest of Transylvania, formally passed with the [[Treaty of Trianon]] from Hungarian to Romanian control. The region passed again to Hungary with the 1940 Treaty of the Belvedere (also known as the [[Second Vienna Award]]). In 1944, the village was the site of particularly bloody reprisals by Romanian irregulars participating in the recapture of Transylvania from this Hungarian control; a small monument in the village's central square bears witness to the 14 victims, among them an 86-year-old woman. After World War II, it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, it formed part of the [[Magyar Autonomous Region|Hungarian Autonomous Province]], then, of the Mure\u0219-Hungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968. Since then, the commune is part of Harghita County.\n\n==Religious sites and buildings==\n[[File:Csikszentdomokosi cinteremfal.jpg|thumb|left|St. Dominic Roman Catholic church]]\nS\u00e2ndominic's Roman Catholic church was constructed between 1787 and 1802, and still preserves numerous relics and treasures from the Middle Ages. A Greek Catholic church was completed in 1787, and there is also a small Romanian Orthodox church. Numerous chapels are scattered around the village, including the chapel at P\u00e1sztorb\u00fckk.\n\nA small village museum, containing historic farm equipment, costumes and weaponry, has been installed in the upper floor of the former House of Culture. The lower floor retains its function as a meeting-hall and often hosts musical and theatrical events.\n\nExamples of the famous \"Sz\u00e9kely gates,\" richly carved wooden gates often several metres in height, can be seen throughout the village.

The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians' sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members. The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations.

They have a special reserved seat in the nations parliament. In 2002, they numbered 731.

(See also ''[[Macedonians in Slovenia]]''.)\n\nOther significant ethnic Macedonian communities can also be found in the other Western European countries such as Austria, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the whole European Union. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Also in Uruguay, with a significant population in [[Montevideo]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.<ref>Matkovski, Aleksandar, ''Grbovite na Makedonija'', Skopje, 1970.</ref><ref>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 (1990) \u0413\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, Skopje, Macedonia&nbsp;\u2014 {{ISBN|86-15-00160-X}}<br></ref> Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] arose, which modeled itself after the earlier [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|Bulgarian revolutionary traditions]] and adopted their symbols as the [[Bulgarian lion|lion]], etc.<ref>Duncan M.

However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] is somewhat similar.\n* '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992\u20131995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is used unofficially by various  associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization. The authorities projected the settlement of 50,000 families in Macedonia, though only 4,200 families had been placed in 280 colonies by 1940.\" For more see: Ivo Banac,  \"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations. Macedonia could confirm itself as a state with its own past, present and future only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. For more see: Mirjana Maleska.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume.

The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

Built in 2016 by [[Arctech Helsinki Shipyard]], she is the most powerful icebreaker ever to fly the Finnish flag and the first icebreaker in the world to feature environmentally friendly dual-fuel engines capable of using both low-sulfur [[marine diesel oil]] (LSMDO) and [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG). ''Polaris'' was initially ordered by the [[Finnish Transport Agency]], but the ownership was transferred to the state-owned icebreaker operator [[Arctia (company)|Arctia]] after delivery.\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhile the history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the strengthened sleigh-boats used to carry mail from Finland to Sweden in the 17th century, the annual \"ice blockade\" that closed the Finnish ports for the winter months and stopped nearly all foreign trade was not broken until 1890 when the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] commissioned one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. Despite her shortcomings, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] proved that year-round shipping was possible in the Baltic Sea and the first Finnish icebreaker was soon followed by bigger and more powerful vessels with only one purpose: to keep the shipping lanes open and escort merchant ships to and from the Finnish ports through the winter. In the late 1930s, steam gave way to diesel when the first Finnish [[diesel-electric]] icebreaker, [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], entered service in 1939.<ref name=\"hoyrymurtajien_aika\">{{cite book |last= Laurell |first= Seppo |title= H\u00f6yrymurtajien aika |publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6775-6}}</ref>\n\nWhile all Finnish state-owned icebreakers survived the war, Finland had to hand over its newest and most powerful steam-powered icebreakers to the [[Soviet Union]] as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]]. The rebuilding of the icebreaker fleet began in the early 1950s with the commissioning of the diesel-electric [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], the first icebreaker in the world to feature two bow propellers, in 1954.<ref name=\"hoyrymurtajien_aika\" /> She was followed by two more icebreakers before the end of the decade to replace the steam-powered pre-war icebreakers now deemed obsolete, four in the 1960s to answer to the demands of the growing foreign trade, and finally three in the 1970s to keep all Finnish ports open through the winter.<ref name=\"jaasalo\">{{cite book |last= J\u00e4\u00e4salo |first= Helge |title= Pohjoisen satamat auki |publisher= Kustanneosakeyhti\u00f6 Pohjoinen |year= 1980 |isbn= 951-9152-17-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Finnish National Board of Navigation began looking for a replacement for the three 1950s icebreakers which were small and, despite their size, expensive to operate as they required a relatively large crew of 53. They were replaced by two large icebreakers, [[Otso (icebreaker)|''Otso'']] and [[Kontio (icebreaker)|''Kontio'']], featuring extensive automation, [[alternating current]] propulsion motors with [[cycloconverter]] drive, and a sleek hull form perfected in a model basin, but for the first time since the late 1800s no bow propellers.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kaukiainen |first= Yrj\u00f6 |title= Navigare Necesse\u2014Merenkulkulaitos 1917\u20131992 |publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6776-4}}</ref> Around the same time, the National Board of Navigation also began looking for secondary uses for the icebreakers which were traditionally employed only for three to five months per year and spent the summer months moored at [[Katajanokka]] in [[Helsinki]]. When the next class of post-war icebreakers was approaching the end of its economic life, it was decided to replace them with multipurpose vessels that could be chartered to support commercial offshore operations in oil fields when they were not needed in the Finnish waters.<ref name=\"tellefsen\" /> Three such multipurpose icebreakers were built in the 1990s: [[MSV Fennica|''Fennica'']] (1993), [[MSV Nordica|''Nordica'']] (1994), and [[MSV Botnica|''Botnica'']] (1998). The vessels, which were the first large icebreakers to utilize [[azimuth thruster]]s for propulsion, were sometimes criticized for their lower icebreaking performance and higher operational costs when compared to traditional icebreakers.<ref name=\"voelker\">Voelker, R.

According to the specification, the new icebreaker would have to be at least equivalent to the most powerful Finnish icebreakers in service at the time \u2014 the 16.2-megawatt quad-screw [[Atle-class icebreaker|''Urho''-class icebreakers]] \u2014 in terms of icebreaking capability. Optimized for escort icebreaker operations in the northern [[Baltic Sea]], the vessel would have to be powerful enough to operate without becoming immobilized in all prevailing ice conditions, including compressive [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge fields]], and maintain an average escort speed of {{convert|9|to|11|kn}} through the winter. The [[bollard pull]] and propulsion power would have to be sufficient to allow continuous operation in level ice with a thickness of {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} and {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|adj=on}} snow cover as well as make the vessel capable of opening a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} channel through uniform {{convert|1.2|m|ft|0}} ice field at a speed of {{convert|6|kn}}. The specification also called for excellent maneuverability, demonstrated by the ability to turn 180 degrees in 3 minutes within two ship's lengths in the aforementioned ice conditions.<ref name=\"hankintailmoitus\">Hankintailmoitus: Liikennevirasto: Liikenneviraston j\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajan konseptisuunnittelu sek\u00e4 telakkakilpailutuksen teknisen materiaalin valmistelu mallikokeineen.

Liikennevirasto, 11 February 2013.</ref>\n\nAlthough designed primarily for icebreaking, the new Finnish icebreaker would have a secondary task as an oil spill response vessel during the summer months as a response to the increasing traffic and oil transportation in the Baltic Sea. For this purpose, the vessel would be fitted with equipment for mechanical recovery of spilled oil in both open water and ice conditions. Since icebreakers traditionally have poor seakeeping characteristics due to their rounded hull form, the technical specification stressed the vessel's ability to carry out oil spill response and emergency towing operations in 95% of the prevailing wind and wave conditions in the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"hankintailmoitus\" />\n\nOn 16 April 2013, the Finnish Transport Agency awarded the contract for the design of the new icebreaker to two Finnish engineering companies specializing in the design of icebreaking ships. The vessel would be designed by [[Aker Arctic|Aker Arctic Technology Inc]] in co-operation with [[ILS (company)|ILS Oy]]. In addition to conceptual design, which included comparing two concept alternatives \u2014 a conventional icebreaker with two [[azimuth thruster]]s and a new concept with three propulsion units \u2014 in terms of performance and cost, the companies would prepare the technical material needed to arrange the tender for the construction of the vessel and assist the Finnish Transport Agency in negotiations with shipyards.<ref name=\"livi20130413\">[http://portal.liikennevirasto.fi/sivu/www/e/news/2013/20130417_ib Aker Arctic to design new icebreaker for the Finnish government].

Built in 2016 by [[Arctech Helsinki Shipyard]], she is the most powerful icebreaker ever to fly the Finnish flag and the first icebreaker in the world to feature environmentally friendly dual-fuel engines capable of using both low-sulfur [[marine diesel oil]] (LSMDO) and [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG). ''Polaris'' was initially ordered by the [[Finnish Transport Agency]], but the ownership was transferred to the state-owned icebreaker operator [[Arctia (company)|Arctia]] after delivery.\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhile the history of winter navigation in Finland dates back to the strengthened sleigh-boats used to carry mail from Finland to Sweden in the 17th century, the annual \"ice blockade\" that closed the Finnish ports for the winter months and stopped nearly all foreign trade was not broken until 1890 when the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] commissioned one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. Despite her shortcomings, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] proved that year-round shipping was possible in the Baltic Sea and the first Finnish icebreaker was soon followed by bigger and more powerful vessels with only one purpose: to keep the shipping lanes open and escort merchant ships to and from the Finnish ports through the winter. In the late 1930s, steam gave way to diesel when the first Finnish [[diesel-electric]] icebreaker, [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], entered service in 1939.<ref name=\"hoyrymurtajien_aika\">{{cite book |last= Laurell |first= Seppo |title= H\u00f6yrymurtajien aika |publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6775-6}}</ref>\n\nWhile all Finnish state-owned icebreakers survived the war, Finland had to hand over its newest and most powerful steam-powered icebreakers to the [[Soviet Union]] as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]]. The rebuilding of the icebreaker fleet began in the early 1950s with the commissioning of the diesel-electric [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], the first icebreaker in the world to feature two bow propellers, in 1954.<ref name=\"hoyrymurtajien_aika\" /> She was followed by two more icebreakers before the end of the decade to replace the steam-powered pre-war icebreakers now deemed obsolete, four in the 1960s to answer to the demands of the growing foreign trade, and finally three in the 1970s to keep all Finnish ports open through the winter.<ref name=\"jaasalo\">{{cite book |last= J\u00e4\u00e4salo |first= Helge |title= Pohjoisen satamat auki |publisher= Kustanneosakeyhti\u00f6 Pohjoinen |year= 1980 |isbn= 951-9152-17-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Finnish National Board of Navigation began looking for a replacement for the three 1950s icebreakers which were small and, despite their size, expensive to operate as they required a relatively large crew of 53. They were replaced by two large icebreakers, [[Otso (icebreaker)|''Otso'']] and [[Kontio (icebreaker)|''Kontio'']], featuring extensive automation, [[alternating current]] propulsion motors with [[cycloconverter]] drive, and a sleek hull form perfected in a model basin, but for the first time since the late 1800s no bow propellers.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kaukiainen |first= Yrj\u00f6 |title= Navigare Necesse\u2014Merenkulkulaitos 1917\u20131992 |publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6776-4}}</ref> Around the same time, the National Board of Navigation also began looking for secondary uses for the icebreakers which were traditionally employed only for three to five months per year and spent the summer months moored at [[Katajanokka]] in [[Helsinki]]. When the next class of post-war icebreakers was approaching the end of its economic life, it was decided to replace them with multipurpose vessels that could be chartered to support commercial offshore operations in oil fields when they were not needed in the Finnish waters.<ref name=\"tellefsen\" /> Three such multipurpose icebreakers were built in the 1990s: [[MSV Fennica|''Fennica'']] (1993), [[MSV Nordica|''Nordica'']] (1994), and [[MSV Botnica|''Botnica'']] (1998). The vessels, which were the first large icebreakers to utilize [[azimuth thruster]]s for propulsion, were sometimes criticized for their lower icebreaking performance and higher operational costs when compared to traditional icebreakers.<ref name=\"voelker\">Voelker, R.

According to the specification, the new icebreaker would have to be at least equivalent to the most powerful Finnish icebreakers in service at the time \u2014 the 16.2-megawatt quad-screw [[Atle-class icebreaker|''Urho''-class icebreakers]] \u2014 in terms of icebreaking capability. Optimized for escort icebreaker operations in the northern [[Baltic Sea]], the vessel would have to be powerful enough to operate without becoming immobilized in all prevailing ice conditions, including compressive [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge fields]], and maintain an average escort speed of {{convert|9|to|11|kn}} through the winter. The [[bollard pull]] and propulsion power would have to be sufficient to allow continuous operation in level ice with a thickness of {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} and {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|adj=on}} snow cover as well as make the vessel capable of opening a {{convert|25|m|ft|adj=on}} channel through uniform {{convert|1.2|m|ft|0}} ice field at a speed of {{convert|6|kn}}. The specification also called for excellent maneuverability, demonstrated by the ability to turn 180 degrees in 3 minutes within two ship's lengths in the aforementioned ice conditions.<ref name=\"hankintailmoitus\">Hankintailmoitus: Liikennevirasto: Liikenneviraston j\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajan konseptisuunnittelu sek\u00e4 telakkakilpailutuksen teknisen materiaalin valmistelu mallikokeineen.

For this purpose, the vessel would be fitted with equipment for mechanical recovery of spilled oil in both open water and ice conditions. Since icebreakers traditionally have poor seakeeping characteristics due to their rounded hull form, the technical specification stressed the vessel's ability to carry out oil spill response and emergency towing operations in 95% of the prevailing wind and wave conditions in the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"hankintailmoitus\" />\n\nOn 16 April 2013, the Finnish Transport Agency awarded the contract for the design of the new icebreaker to two Finnish engineering companies specializing in the design of icebreaking ships.

In addition to conceptual design, which included comparing two concept alternatives \u2014 a conventional icebreaker with two [[azimuth thruster]]s and a new concept with three propulsion units \u2014 in terms of performance and cost, the companies would prepare the technical material needed to arrange the tender for the construction of the vessel and assist the Finnish Transport Agency in negotiations with shipyards.<ref name=\"livi20130413\">[http://portal.liikennevirasto.fi/sivu/www/e/news/2013/20130417_ib Aker Arctic to design new icebreaker for the Finnish government].

The [[Bega River (Tisza)|Bega]] river was also [[Bega canal|channelled]] during this time. It was the first city with horse-drawn trams (1869) and the first navigable canal on current Romanian territory.<ref name=info/> This way, Timi\u0219oara had contact with Europe, and even with the rest of the world through the Black Sea, leading to the local development of [[commercialism]].<ref>\"''Timi\u0219oara, monografie Istoric\u0103''\", dr.Nicolae Ilie\u0219u</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agenda.ro/2002/49-02-c.htm |title=Agenda |publisher=Agenda.ro |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agenda.ro/2003/44-03-a.htm |title=Agenda |publisher=Agenda.ro |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> In the 19th century, the railway system of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] reached Timi\u0219oara.

On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived [[Banat Republic]]. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918\u20131919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Centre, and the [[interwar]] years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-revisionist]] demonstrations also took place during this time.\n\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\n\nAfter the war, the [[People's Republic of Romania]] was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietization and later, [[Systematization]]. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture.<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/industria-timisoarei-inflorirea-imperiul-austro-ungar-intreprinderile-comuniste-smecheriile-democratia-originala-1_535f5d910d133766a830736b/index.html Industria Timi\u015foarei] {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref>[https://www.banatulazi.ro/fabricile-celebre-ale-timisoarei-din-comunism-facute-una-cu-pamantul-in-capitalism/ Fabricile celebre ale Timi\u0219oarei din comunism] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KP7BQ3oXXgC|title=Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment|last=Kotkin|first=Stephen|publisher=Modern Library|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8129-6679-4|location=|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 decembrie 1989: Timi\u0219oara, primul ora\u015f liber de comunism|url = http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Timisoara/Stiri/20+decembrie+1989+Timisoara+primul+oras+liber|website = www.digi24.ro|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bega Canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bega Canal]]]]\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} on the southeast edge of the [[Banat]] plain, part of the [[Pannonian Plain]] near the divergence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], but on the [[Bega Canal]]. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only {{convert|0.5|to(-)|5|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings. The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Romania}}\nClimate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.\n\nFrom September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.\n\nFreak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until first of November.

On 1 November they proclaimed the short-lived [[Banat Republic]]. In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and Timi\u0219oara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918\u20131919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] awarded Timi\u0219oara the status of a University Centre, and the [[interwar]] years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-revisionist]] demonstrations also took place during this time.\n\nDuring World War II, Timi\u0219oara suffered damage from both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the Allies. The German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, but without success.\n\nAfter the war, the [[People's Republic of Romania]] was proclaimed, and Timi\u0219oara underwent Sovietization and later, [[Systematization]]. The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. Timi\u0219oara became highly industrialised both through new investments and by increasing the capacities of the old enterprises in various industries: machine building, textile and footwear, electrical, food, plastics, optical, building materials, furniture.<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/locale/timisoara/industria-timisoarei-inflorirea-imperiul-austro-ungar-intreprinderile-comuniste-smecheriile-democratia-originala-1_535f5d910d133766a830736b/index.html Industria Timi\u015foarei] {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref>[https://www.banatulazi.ro/fabricile-celebre-ale-timisoarei-din-comunism-facute-una-cu-pamantul-in-capitalism/ Fabricile celebre ale Timi\u0219oarei din comunism] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, Timi\u0219oara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Anti-Communist Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KP7BQ3oXXgC|title=Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment|last=Kotkin|first=Stephen|publisher=Modern Library|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8129-6679-4|location=|pages=84\u201387}}</ref> On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timi\u0219oara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 20 decembrie 1989: Timi\u0219oara, primul ora\u015f liber de comunism|url = http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Timisoara/Stiri/20+decembrie+1989+Timisoara+primul+oras+liber|website = www.digi24.ro|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bega Canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bega Canal]]]]\nTimi\u0219oara lies at an altitude of {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} on the southeast edge of the [[Banat]] plain, part of the [[Pannonian Plain]] near the divergence of the [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]] and [[Bega (Tisza)|Bega]] rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timi\u0219oara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the river [[Timi\u0219 (river)|Timi\u0219]], but on the [[Bega Canal]]. This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega Canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only {{convert|0.5|to(-)|5|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings.

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.\n\nFrom September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.\n\nFreak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until first of November. The median date for the first freeze is 22 October, while that of the last freeze is 15 April. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data, [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]\n|1787 | 9479\n|1847 | 18103\n|1869 | 32725\n|1880 | 33694\n|1890 | 39884\n|1900 | 53033\n|1910 | 72555\n|1920 | 82689\n|1930 | 91580\n|1941 | 110840\n|1948 | 111987\n|1956 | 142257\n|1966 | 174243\n|1977 | 269353\n|1992 | 334115\n|2002 | 317660\n|2011 | 319279\n|2016 | 332983\n}}\n\n[[File:Festivalul Florilor TimFloralis.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The historic centre of Timi\u0219oara, with the [[Timi\u0219oara Orthodox Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]]]]\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Timi\u0219oara has a population of 319,279.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/> As defined by INS, the Timi\u0219oara [[functional urban area]] has a population of 468,162.<ref name=\"world_bank\">{{cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/448771499322731333/pdf/116400-ROMANIAN-REVISED-PUBLIC-Magnet-Cities-Migration-and-Commuting-in-Romania-RO.|title=Error}}</ref>\n\nOf this population, 86.79% were ethnic [[Romanians]], while 5.12% were [[Hungarians]], 1.37% [[Ethnic German|Germans]], 1.3% [[Serbs]], 0.69% [[Romani people|Romani]], 0.18% [[Ukrainians]], 0.17% [[Slovaks]], 0.11% [[Jews]] and 0.76% others.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=1832&judet_id=2057&localitate_id=2058 | title = Ethno-demographic Structure of Romania | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | publisher = The Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center }}</ref> 14.2% of the population are under 15 years of age, 4.0% are over 75.\n\nSince 1990, Timi\u0219oara saw a slight population decline owing to [[Human migration|migration]] and a drop in birthrates.

[[Motion pictures]] were initially exhibited as a fairground novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of [[communication]] and [[entertainment]] in the 20th century. Major developments in motion picture technology have included the adoption of [[synchronized motion picture sound]], [[color motion picture film]], and the adoption of [[digital film]] technologies to replace physical [[film stock]] at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors. \n\n==Development of motion picture technology==\n\n{{Main|Precursors of film}}\nThe [[technology]] of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of [[projector|projection]], [[lens (optics)|lens]]es, [[photography]] and [[optics]].\nEarly techniques that involve motion and/or projection include:\n*[[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|Shadowgraphy]] (probably in practice since prehistoric times)\n*[[Camera obscura]] (a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times)\n*[[Shadow play|Shadow puppetry]] (possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China)\n*[[Magic lantern]] (developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s)\n*stroboscopic \"[[persistence of vision]]\" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868) \n\nLive projection of moving images occur in the [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that may have been used artistically since prehistory. The use of a lens in a camera obscura has been dated back to 1550.<ref name=Ilardi>{{cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|publisher=American Philosophical Society|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|year=2007|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC/page/n231 220]|quote=Cardano De subtilitate libri camera obscura.|isbn=9780871692597}}</ref> Mobile camera obscura devices were used since the early 17th century, first in tents and not much later in wooden boxes. The box-type camera would be adapted into a photographic camera in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nIn or before 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. It projected slides that were usually painted in color on glass. A 1659 sketch by Huygens indicates that moving images may have been part of the earliest screenings. Around 1790 multi-media [[phantasmagoria]] spectacles were developed. Rear projection, animated slides, multiple projectors (superimposition), mobile projectors (on tracks or handheld), projection on smoke, sounds, odors and even electric shocks were used to frighten audiences with a convincing ghost horror experience. In the 19th century several other popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, et cetera) or that showed for instance falling snow or the planets and their moons revolving.\n\nMany aspects of cinema are closely related to theatre. The term \"photoplay\", used in the early days of cinema, reflects ideas of motion pictures as filmed plays. Technologies used for the theatre, such as stage lighting and all kinds of [[special effects]] were automatically adopted for use in front of cameras.\n\n====1832\u20131833: Stroboscopic animation principle====\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Animated GIF of ''Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe'' No. X (Trentsensky & Vieweg 1833)]]\nThe basic stroboscopic principle that allowed the creation of motion pictures was discovered by [[Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau|Joseph Plateau]] in Belgium around December 1832 and published in January 1833. His invention \u2013 later known as the fantascope or [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] \u2013 was a cardboard disc with slits through which the viewer could watch a rapid succession of sequential drawings (photography wasn't introduced yet) reflected in a mirror. If a ph\u00e9nakisticope disc spins fast enough it invisibly replaces each picture by the next one and the viewer sees figures in fluent motion. A very similar \"Stroboscope Disc\" was independently invented in Austria by [[Simon von Stampfer]] around the same time (probably some weeks later). Stampfer also mentioned several possible variations of his [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] invention, including a cylinder (similar to the later ''[[zoetrope]]'') as well as a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (somewhat similar to film) and a theater-like frame (much like the later [[praxinoscope]] theatre).\n\n====1833\u20131843: Early stroboscopic animation projector concepts====\nStampfer also suggested using the stroboscopic principle on \"transparencies\" and Plateau thought it might find application in phantasmagoria. It seemed a simple and logical next step, but in practice it turned out to be relatively complicated. Apart from mica and glass there were hardly any transparent materials that could be used and it took years before mechanisms were developed that enabled fluent animation to be projected.\n\nIn 1843, T.W. Naylor (an experimenter from Newcastle about whom little else is known) published details and an illustration of his plan for a \"Phantasmagoria for the projection of moving figures\" (by then, the word \"phantasmagoria\" was often used for a type of magic lanterns). It would use an [[Argand lamp]] or [[Drummond light]] to project sequential images from a rotating glass disk. A shutter disk would be mounted on the same axis as the picture disk to have its holes coincide with pictures when turned with a hand-crank. Naylor suggested tracing the pictures from readily available printed phenakisticopes, colouring them with translucent colours mixed with oil-varnish and covering the remaining portion of the disk with thick black paint.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=3u01AQAAMAAJ&dq=%22t.w.%20naylor%22&pg=PA319#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Mechanics' Magazine and Journal of Science, Arts, and Manufactures|date=1843|publisher=Knight and Lacey|language=en}}</ref> Nothing else has been found regarding Naylor's machine, so it remains uncertain whether it was ever even constructed.\n\nFranz von Uchatius developed two phenakisticope-based projectors, the first around 1851 and the second was demonstrated to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1853.<ref name=Herbertproj1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelPROJECTINGpart1.htm|title=PROJECTION Phenakistoscope 1|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nFrom around 1853 until the 1890s J. Duboscq in Paris marketed different models of a projection ph\u00e9nakisticope. It had a glass disc with a diameter of 34 centimeters for the pictures and a separate disc with four lenses. The discs rotated at different speeds.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/phenakistiscope-de-projectionap-95-1631.html |title=Ph\u00e9nakistiscope de projection (AP-95-1631) |language=French |publisher=La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThomas Ross developed a small transparent ph\u00e9nakisticope system, called ''Wheel of life'', which fitted inside a standard magic lantern slide. A first version, patented in 1869, had a glass disc with eight phases of a movement and a counter-rotating glass shutter disc with eight apertures. The discs depicted Ice Skaters, Fishes, Giant's Ladder, Bottle Imp and other subjects. An improved version had 13 images and a single slot shutter disc, and received British Patent 2685 on 10 October 1871.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8085514/ross-wheel-of-life-magic-lantern-slide-magic-lantern-slide |title=Ross 'Wheel of Life' magic lantern slide |publisher=Science Museum Group |location=London |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1849-1860s: Photography in motion===\nDuring the first decades after the introduction of photography in 1839, this new technique was occasionally combined with ph\u00e9nakisticopes and proto-[[zoetrope]]s, relatively often with stereoscopic pairs. [[Stereoscope|Stereoscopic]] photography, which became very popular in the early 1850s, led to the belief that photography could be further developed into a perfect illusion of reality. Photographic recordings with motion and colour were the logical next steps. Before the necessary photographic emulsions and  mechanics were fast enough to capture a photographic sequence in real-time, early attempts recorded simulated motion sequences by photographing different poses and/or positions separately. This technique became known as [[stop motion]] much later.\n\nIn 1849, Joseph Plateau published a note about improvements for the fantascope. He combined the stroboscopic disc with aspects of his [[anorthoscope]] to create a 27 cm translucent disc (oiled paper on a cardboard frame) that was lit from behind and had a stroboscopic 4-slit black metal shutter disc in front. The pictures, 16 in Plateau's example, were designed with a 4 to 5 anamorphic width to compensate the deformation of the resulting image. The animation could be seen with both eyes by several people at the same time, with greatly improved image quality. A screen behind the translucent disc blocked the light, except for a cutout trapezoid area that corresponded with the space where the figures were visible at the proper position. A gear system for the rotation ensured that the image would appear in the right area. Plateau used the translucency of the disc to create light effects in the designs. One extant disc, made in collaboration with painter [[Jean Baptiste Madou]], shows a demon's head blowing on a glowing coal. Plateau stated that the illusion could be advanced even further with an idea communicated to him by Charles Wheatstone: a combination of fantascope and stereoscope. Plateau believed two copies of his improved fantascope could be adapted to deliver stereoscopic images to Wheatstone's reflecting stereoscope. He thought the construction of a sequential set of stereoscopic image pairs would be more difficult. Wheatstone had suggested using photographs on paper of a solid object, for instance a statuette. Plateau concluded that for this purpose 16 plaster models could be made with 16 regular modifications. He believed such a project would take much time and careful effort, but would be well wort it because of the expected marvelous results.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9fZUAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA254&ots=ciVL2_BZaf&dq=%22persistance%20des%20impressions%20de%20la%20retine%E2%80%9D%20bulletin%20academie%20royale%22&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Bulletins de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique|last=Belgique|first=Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de|date=1849|publisher=Hayez|language=fr}}</ref> Unfortunately, the plan was never executed, possibly because Plateau became almost completely blind by this time. Eventually the idea was communicated to instrumentmaker [[Jules Duboscq]], who since 1850 very successfully marketed a stereoscope with lenses in collaboration with [[David Brewster]] (he also sold Wheatstone's version with mirrors, became the French publisher for Plateau's fantascope and offered a projector on wheels for phantasmagoria, among many other optical instruments).<ref>Duboscq catalogue 1851</ref>\n\nDuboscq patented the st\u00e9r\u00e9oscope on 16 February 1852, with mention of a projection variation. On 12 November 1852 he applied for an addition certificate to include his \"St\u00e9r\u00e9oscope-fantascope, ou B\u00efoscope\".<ref>Brevet d'Invention 13069</ref> Basically a combination of Plateau's standard fantascope and the stereoscope, it used two small mirrors in different angles next to each other that reflected stereoscopic image pairs (printed above each other on the stroboscopic disc) into the stereoscope viewer. Of three planned variations only one was actually produced, but it wasn't very successful commercially. Only one extant disc is known, from the Joseph Plateau estate kept at the Ghent University.<ref name=dorikens>{{cite book|title=Joseph Plateau 1801\u20131883: Living between Art and Science|last=Dorikens|first=Maurice|year=2001}}</ref> It has stereoscopic sets of a sequence of photographic images of a machine in action. No original viewing device has resurfaced, but parts of it are known from an illustration in an 1853 advertisement.\n\nIn 1851, [[Antoine Claudet]] wrote to French magazine ''La Lumi\u00e8re'' in response to a patent given to the Mayer brothers for their \"multiplicateur\", which photographed multiple (identical) images onto a single plate (a technique that created the [[carte de visite]] format that was very popular in the 1860s). Claudet claimed to have invented something very similar in 1844, with results exhibited at the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844]], including a self portrait that showed 12 sides of his face.<ref>''La Lumi\u00e8re'' 1851-03-09</ref> Before the end of 1851, Claudet claimed to have created a stereoscope that showed people in motion.<ref>''La Lumi\u00e8re'' 1851-11-16</ref> The stereo viewer could show a motion of two phases repetitively. During the next two years, Claudet worked on a camera that would record stereoscopic pairs for four different poses (patented in 1853).<ref>British patent 711</ref> Claudet found that the stereoscopic effect didn't work properly in this device, but believed the illusion of motion was successful.<ref>Le Cosmos 1852-10-03</ref> \n\nInstrument maker [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] (or possibly a lesser known Frederic Wenham) would claim in 1895 that he had already made a series of ten stereoscopic images to be viewed on two [[phenakistiscope]]s in 1852.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=C1dgJ3-y1ZsC&lpg=PA201&dq=%22english%20mechanic%22%20wenham&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q=wenham&f=false |title = Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838\u20131952|isbn = 0813172713|last1 = Zone|first1 = Ray|date = December 2007}}</ref><ref>http://www.billjayonphotography.com/UpTheNileWithFrancisFrith.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1855, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak]]'s published an article about his Stereophoroskop and other experiments aimed at stereoscopic moving images. He mentioned a method of sticking needles in a [[phenakistiscope|stroboscopic disc]], so that they would appear as if moving in and out of the cardboard when animated. He supposed that this principle provided endless possibilities to make different 3D animations. He then introduced two methods to animate stereoscopic pairs of images, one was basically a stereo viewer using two stroboscopic discs and the other was more or less similar to the later [[zoetrope]] (but in a vertical position with horizontal slits). Czermak explained how suitable stereoscopic photographs could be made by recording a series of models, with an example of a growing pyramid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit15017/index.meta&viewMode=auto&pn=1|last=Czermak|title=Das Stereophoroskop|year=1855|language=German}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 1850s the first examples of [[instantaneous photography]] appeared, which further inspired hope for the possibilities of motion photography. In 1860, [[John Herschel]] envisioned the stereoscopic representation of scenes in action. He figured that photography could already, or would soon be able to take snap-shots in one tenth of a second and that a mechanism was possible \"by which a prepared plate may be presented, focused, impressed, displaced, secured in the dark, and replaced by another within two or three tenths of a second\". Apparently without knowledge of Duboscq's st\u00e9r\u00e9ofantascope, Herschel believed the \"phenakistoscope\" (sic) could very well be adapted into a viewer for stereoscopic motion photography pairs. He also had high hopes for the development of colour photography, since he himself had already obtained promising results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044096812060&view=1up&seq=443|title=The photographic news.  v.3\u20134 (1859\u20131860).|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, Joseph Charles d'Almeida published descriptions of two methods that he had successfully developed to project stereoscopic images. The first was an [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] method with red and green glasses, the second used the [[stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic principle]] to alternately present each picture to the corresponding eye in quick succession. D'Almeida had started work on combining this method with the principles of the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111368q|title=Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie|date=1858|website=Gallica|language=EN|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 February 1860 Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices.

In his application he stated: \"This has frequently been done with plane pictures but\nhas never been, with stereoscopic pictures\". He used three sets of stereoscopic photographs in a sequence with some duplicates to regulate the flow of a simple repetitive motion, but also described a system for very large series of pictures of complicated motion.<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US31357.pdf</ref><ref>https://archive.org/stream/howmotionpictur00croygoog#page/n28/mode/2up/search/kinematoscope</ref>\n\nAround 1865, a disc with nine oval photographic images of [[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b]] (1787\u20131869) turning around, currently in the collection of the National Technical Museum in Prague, was probably created by the physiologist himself.<ref>https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/cine/2014-v24-n2-3-cine01417/1025153ar/</ref> Purkyn\u011b reportedly used the disc to entertain his grandchildren and show them how he, an old professor, could turn around at great speed.<ref>Ludv\u00edk Sou\u010dek, Jak se sv\u011btlo nau\u010dilo kreslit (How the light learned to draw), SNDK, Prague, 1963, pp. 106\u20137.</ref>\n\n===1874-1890s: The chronophotograpers and Donisthorpe===\n{{Main| Chronophotography}}\n\n[[Jules Janssen]] developed a large [[Janssen revolver|photographic revolver]] to document the stages of the [[transit of Venus]] in 1874, regarded as an important method to determine the [[Astronomical Unit]] (the distance between earth and the sun). Several copies of the device were used at different geographic points. Many negative images of the different phases of Venus passing in front of the sun were captured on glass discs, in an early form of [[time-lapse photography]]. Unfortunately, the quality was not sufficient for a calculation of the Astronomical Unit. Several photographic revolver discs with images have been preserved, but research concluded that all of the known discs contained test recordings of a model in front of a circular light source (or brightly lit surface).

The camera would have a mechanism to move photographic plates one by one past a lens and shutter to be exposed for the necessary time and then dropped or carried into a receiver. The recorded images would be printed at equal distances apart on a strip of paper. The strip was to be wound between cylinders and carried past the eye of the observer, with a stroboscopic device to expose each picture momentarily. Such photographic strips only became commercially available several years later.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mgc_x5ph3sEC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=kin%C3%A9tiscope&source=bl&ots=bsSzStADY1&sig=ACfU3U0WgFe9HzWJ8dl5C8T0H-FTdjiVhA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix-6OplbLnAhVLb1AKHUC1DFEQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph|last=Herbert|first=Stephen|date=1998|publisher=The Projection Box|isbn=978-0-9523941-3-6|language=en}}</ref> \n\n[[Thomas Edison]] demonstrated his [[phonograph]] on 29 November 1877, after previous announcements of the device for recording and replaying sound had been published earlier in the year.

Add the talking phonograph to counterfeit their voices and it would be difficult to carry the illusion of real presence much further\". Donisthorpe announced in the 24 January 1878 edition of ''Nature'' that he would advance that conception: \"By combining the phonograph with the kinesigraph I will undertake not only to produce a talking picture of Mr. Gladstone which, with motionless lips and unchanged expression shall positively recite his latest anti-Turkish speech in his own voice and tone.

A demonstration took place on June 15 at Stanford's stock farm in [[Palo Alto, California]], with the press present.

He used the chronophotographic gun for studying animal and human locomotion.\n\nSoon after Muybridge's sequential pictures were published, or at least since January 1879, there were several people who placed these in [[zoetrope]]s to watch them in motion.<ref>http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muybZOETROPES.htm</ref> These were possibly the very first viewings of photographic motion pictures that were recorded in real-time. The quality of the pictures was limited and the figures were mostly seen as silhouettes, often furthered by retouching of the pictures to get rid of photographic irregularities.\n\nFrom 1879 to 1893 Muybridge gave lectures in which he projected silhouettes of his pictures with a device he called a [[zoopraxiscope]]. It used pictures that were painted onto glass discs. This can be regarded as an early [[movie projector]] and a precursor to [[rotoscoping]]. \n\nAnother early projector was built by [[Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz]] in 1887. His [[Electrotachyscope]] used 24 images on a rotating glass disk.<ref>''Faszination der Bewegung: Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz zwischen Photographie und Kino'' p. 185, Deac Rossell. {{ISBN|3-87877-774-4}}</ref> In 1894 his invention projected moving images<ref>''Industry, liberty, and a vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's kinesigraph'', Stephen Herbert, p. 13, {{ISBN|0-9523941-3-8}}</ref> in Berlin.\n\nPrompted by the much publicized successes of Muybridge's photographic sequences and related ideas, inventors in the late 19th century began to realize that the making and showing of photographic 'moving pictures' of a more useful or even indefinite length was a practical possibility. Many people working in the field followed the international developments closely through information in periodicals, patent filings, personal contact with colleagues and/or by getting their hands on new equipment.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/579606/Serpentine_dance_Inter-national_connections_in_early_cinema?email_work_card=view-paper</ref>\n\n===1886\u20131889: Le Prince's motion pictures===\n[[File:Roundhay Garden Scene.ogv|''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'' 1888, the first known motion-picture film.|thumb|right]]\nThe oldest known proper motion picture cameras<!-- a multi-lensed one was patented in 1864, although probably never built --> were developed by the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Louis Le Prince]] in the 1880s, while working in [[Leeds]], [[England]]. On 2 November 1886, he applied for a US patent for a \"Method of and apparatus for producing animated pictures of natural scenery and life\", which was granted on 10 January 1888. It described a multi-lens camera in detail and provided some information on a projector, but construction details for the projector were planned to be patented separately. The idea for a two-fold apparatus was also included. The camera could be fitted with three, four, eight, nine, sixteen or more lenses and was illustrated with sixteen lenses in the patent documents. The images were to be recorded as negatives on a pair of sensitive films, stored on two lower drums and mechanically transported without interruption to two upper drums, past lenses and successively operated shutters. The sensitive film could be \"an endless sheet of insoluble gelatine coated with bromide emulsion or any convenient ready-made quick-acting paper, such as Eastman's paper film\". For longer recordings, the receiver could be suited with extra supply boxes after the first boxes were exhausted. With sixteen lenses the camera could record 960 images per minute (16 per second). The projector would have positive transparencies on flexible material, \"such as gelatine, mica, horn &c\" to be \"adjusted on a pair of endless metallic ribbons accurately punctured with small round holes\" and guided past the lenses and shutters by pins on drums. Shorter sequences could be projected from glass discs instead of the films on drums. Le Prince intended the pictures to \"pass through the hands of artits\" to be suitably colored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=00376247&IDKey=94442ED43DB9&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0376247.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0376247%2526RS%3DPN%2F0376247|title=Method of and apparatus for producing animated pictures of natural scenery and life|last=|first=|date=10 January 1888|website=|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite patent|title=le prince|gdate=1888-01-10|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US376247A/en}}</ref> Although the camera was capable of 'capturing' motion, it was not a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint, with the result that foreground elements in the [[Movie projector|projected]] scene wove about relative to each other and to the background.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn May 1887,<ref name=\"Naughton\">[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/LE_PRINCE_BIO.html Adventures in CyberSound: Le Prince, Louis Aim\u00e9 Augustin], Dr Russell Naughton (using source: Michael Harvey, NMPFT Pioneers of Early Cinema: 1.

He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie]] on 4 June 1880, but did not market his ''praxinoscope a projection'' before 1882. He then further developed the device into the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique]] which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting colourful images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. The strip could be manually moved past a lens and mirror projection system, sometimes back and forth to show repetitive motions as desired for certain scenes. Some sound effects were synchronized by electro-magnetic devices, triggered by metal parts on the strip, while a score with some songs were to be performed live. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin in Paris.\n\n=== Development of film stock ===\nAnother early pioneer, working at roughly the same time as Le Prince, was [[William Friese-Greene]]. He began to experiment with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of [[celluloid]]. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera. This was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British ''Photographic News'' on February 28, 1890.<ref>Braun, Marta, (1992) ''Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830\u20131904)'', p. 190, Chicago: University of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-07173-1}}''';''' Robinson, David, (1997)   ''From Peepshow to Palace: The Birth of American Film'', p. 28, New York and Chichester, West Sussex, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-10338-7}})</ref> He gave a public demonstration in 1890 of his device, but the low [[frame rate]] combined with the device's apparent unreliability made an unfavourable impression.\n\nDonisthorpe's interest in moving pictures was revived when he heard about the successful experiments of [[Louis Le Prince]], who was then working in Donsithorpe's home town of [[Leeds]]. In 1889, he took out a patent, jointly with [[William Carr Crofts]], for a camera using celluloid roll film and a projector system; they then made a short film of the bustling traffic in [[London]]'s [[Trafalgar Square]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/donisthorpe|title=Wordsworth Donisthorpe: British inventor and political activist|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Paul T |last=Burns |title=The History of The Discovery of Cinematography \u2013 1885 \u2013 1889 |url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/1885.htm |accessdate=2009-05-10 |postscript=<!--None-->}} and {{Cite web |title=Ten Remaining Frames Of Donisthorpe's 1890 'Trafalgar Square' Footage Come To Life |url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/images/trafalgarsquare_animation_small.gif |format=GIF |accessdate=2009-05-10 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert, S.|year=1998|title=Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph|publisher=[[The Projection Box]]|location=London|isbn=0-9523941-3-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickson greeting.jpg|thumb|Film still from ''[[Dickson Greeting]]''. In May 1891, it became the first American film shown to a public audience.]]\nAnother, more successful apparatus was invented by the Scottish inventor and employee of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], [[W. K. L. Dickson]]. His camera, called the [[Kinetograph]], was patented in 1891 and took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated on to a transparent [[Celluloid|celluloid strip]] 35&nbsp;mm wide. The celluloid blocks were thinly sliced, then removed with heated pressure plates. After this, they were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nIn 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], [[Thomas Edison]] revealed the '[[Kinetoscope]]' to the public. The machine was contained within a large box, and only permitted the images to be viewed by one person at a time looking into it through a peephole, after starting the machine by inserting a coin. The parlours were supplied with film snippets photographed by Dickson, in Edison's [[Edison's Black Maria|\"Black Maria\"]] studio. These sequences recorded both mundane incidents, such as ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]'', and entertainment acts, such as acrobats, [[music hall]] performers and boxing demonstrations. The [[Kinetoscope]] [[Peep show|peep-show]] parlor first opened on April 14, 1894, and was the first commercial exhibition of film. Kinetoscope parlors soon spread successfully to Europe. Edison, however, never attempted to patent these instruments on the other side of the Atlantic, since they relied so greatly on [[Precursors of film|previous experiments and innovations]] from Britain and Europe.\n\nThe Pleograph, invented by Polish emigre [[Kazimierz Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski]] in 1894<ref>Maciej Ilowiecki, \"Dzieje nauki polskiej\", Wydawnictwo Interpress, Warszawa 1981, {{ISBN|8322318766}}, p.202 (Polish).</ref> was another early camera. It also doubled up as a projector. The apparatus used a rectangle of celluloid with perforations between several parallel rows of images. Using an improved pleograph, Pr\u00f3szynski shot short films showing scenes of life in [[Warsaw]], such as people skating in the park.\n\n===Flicker problem and solutions===\nBefore 1902, the quality of the experience of films was usually troubled by an obvious flicker in the projected image. The problem arose from the combination of the shutter and the intermittent transport of the film strip. Light came through the shutter at the moment a frame was very shortly held still at the projector gate to get a clear image without [[motion blur]]. Light was blocked at the moment the film was quicly advanced to the next frame. Intermittently blocking the light was necessary for the stroboscopic effect that was widely known from the ph\u00e9nakisticope and zoetrope. The strain of starting and stopping also often caused damage to the film strip and could cause the system to jam (often with the result of burning the combustible film material as it was exposed to the heat of the lamp for too long). Eventually the solution was found in a three-bladed shutter that not just blocked the light intermittently during film transport, but more often and also during projection. The first three-bladed shutter was developed by Theodor P\u00e4tzold and went in production with Messter in 1902.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/378378/Double_Think_The_Cinema_and_Magic_Lantern_Culture</ref>\n\n==Development of the film industry==\n\n===Commercial cinema===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-035-15, Berlin, Wintergarten.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]] was the site of the first [[Movie theater|cinema]], with a short movie presented by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in November 1895]]\n[[Image:Cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The first film poster, for the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers']] screening of ''[[L'Arroseur arros\u00e9]]'' in 1895.]]\n\nThe [[Eidoloscope]], devised by [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]] for the [[Woodville Latham|Latham]] family, was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895 and opened to the paying public on May 20, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo-Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from [[Madison Square Garden]]'s roof on May 4.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Streible|first1=Dan|title=Fight Pictures: A History of Boxing and Early Cinema|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520940581|pages=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bpc1fk5T5dYC&pg=PA46|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=2008-04-11}}</ref> It was the first commercial projection.\n\nAnother commercial public motion-picture film presentation was made by [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]] in Berlin, who projected with their apparatus \"Bioscop\", a flickerfree duplex construction, November 1 through 31, 1895.

The Edison company took up a projector developed by Armat and Jenkins, the \"Phantoscope\", which was renamed the Vitascope, and it joined various projecting machines made by other people to show the 480&nbsp;mm width films being made by the Edison company and others in France and the UK.\n\nInitially, a lack of standardization meant that film producers used a variety of different film widths and projection speeds, but after a few years the 35-mm wide Edison film, and the 16-frames-per-second projection speed of the Lumi\u00e8re Cin\u00e9matographe became the standard.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Birt Acres]] designed the first [[Home movies|camera for amateur use]] in 1898.

It became the practice for the producing companies to sell prints outright to the exhibitors, at so much per foot, regardless of the subject. Typical prices initially were 15 cents a foot in the United States, and one shilling a foot in Britain. [[Hand-colouring|Hand-coloured]] films, which were being produced of the most popular subjects before 1900, cost 2 to 3 times as much per foot. There were a few producers, such as the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, who did not sell their films, but exploited them solely with their own exhibition units.\n\nThe first public motion-picture film presentation in the world was done by [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]] at the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]], who projected with their apparatus \"Bioscop\", a flickerfree duplex construction, from November 1 through 31, 1895.\n\n[[Image:Auditorium Theatre in Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] in 1910 showing \"The Heroine of Mafeking\".]]\nThe first theatres dedicated to motion-pictures were established at the turn of the century, soon becoming known as [[Movie theater|cinemas]]. The [[Vitascope Hall]] in [[New Orleans]] was opened in 1896 as one of the first such establishments. It showed two exhibitions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n\nAnother early establishment was the [[Islington|Islington Palace]], originally built in 1869 as part of the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]] complex.

The Kinemacolor camera had red and green filters in the apertures of its rotating shutter, so that alternating red-filtered and green-filtered views of the subject were recorded on consecutive frames of the [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The Kinemacolor projector did the same thing in reverse, projecting the frames of the black-and-white print alternately through the red and green filters in its rotating shutter.\n\nBoth devices were operated at twice the usual frame rate to reduce the color flicker (technically known as \"color bombardment\") produced by non-simultaneous projection of the two color components, a defect which some viewers barely noticed but which others found obtrusive and headache-inducing. A related defect was the most obvious shortcoming of this process: because the two components had not been photographed at the same time, as pairs of frames, rapidly moving subjects did not adequately match up from one frame to the next when projected on the screen, resulting in color \"fringes\" or in extreme cases vividly colored \"ghosts\". A white dog wagging its tail in front of a dark background could appear to have several tails, variously red, green and white.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/kinemacolor-book1.htm Widescreen Museum]</ref>\n\n[[Image:kinemacolor1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kinemacolor]], 1911 (appearance of projected image simulated by a color composite of two consecutive frames)]]\nThe first motion picture exhibited in Kinemacolor was an eight-minute short titled ''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'', which was trade-shown in September 1908. The general public first saw Kinemacolor in a program of 21 short films shown on 26 February 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London.  The process was first seen in the US on 11 December 1909, at an exhibition staged by Smith and Urban at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.<ref>http://bioscopic.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/colourful-stories-no-11-kinemacolor-in-america</ref>\n\nKinemacolor released the first drama filmed in the process, ''Checkmated'', in 1910, and the first feature-length [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', in 1912.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=2360560|title=Salvage Operations of S.S. Oceana|description=Produced by the Natural Colour Kinematograph Co., Brighton}}</ref> \nKinemacolor projectors were installed in some 300 cinemas in Britain, and 54 dramatic films were produced. Four dramatic short films were made in Kinemacolor in the US in 1912\u20131913,<ref>''La Tosca'' (1912), ''Mission Bells'' (1913), ''The Rivals'' (1913), and ''The Scarlet Letter'' (1913).</ref> and one in Japan in 1914. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors.\n\nA variant method was promoted by [[William Friese-Greene]]. He called his additive color system \"Biocolour\". It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes. An ordinary projector could therefore be used, if it would bear being cranked at a sufficient rate. Like Kinemacolor, Biocolour suffered from noticeable color flicker and from red and green fringing when the subject was in rapid motion.\n\nIn 1913, French film entrepreneur and inventor [[L\u00e9on Gaumont]] unveiled Chronochrome, a full-color additive system. The camera used three lenses with color filters to photograph red, green and blue color components simultaneously on consecutive frames of one strip of 35&nbsp;mm black-and-white film. The projector had a corresponding triad of lenses. To reduce the strain imposed on the film as the mechanism in each device pulled it down three frames at a time, frame height was reduced from the usual four [[film perforations]] to three, resulting in a widescreen image format identical with the modern 16:9 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nChronochrome's color quality was impressive, as surviving specimens attest,<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/gaumont.htm Gaumont Chronochrome at the WideScreen Museum]. Retrieved 24 June 2016.</ref> and because the three frames were exposed and projected simultaneously, Kinemacolor's color bombardment and color fringes around moving objects were avoided. However, because the camera's three lenses could not all photograph the scene from exactly the same viewpoint, subjects that were too near the camera would exhibit color fringes if the registration of the three projected images was optimized for the background of the scene, and vice versa. A method of notching the prints to trigger automatic adjustment of the projection optics was invented, but expert supervision of the presentation was still a requisite. Light loss due to the color filters and the constrained dimensions of the projection lenses resulted in an image that was too dim for showing in a large auditorium unless a highly reflective metalized screen or rear-projection onto a translucent screen was used, and either solution created a \"hot spot\" that made the views from the side sections of the auditorium very unsatisfactory. The films were seldom screened outside of Gaumont's own cinemas and the system soon fell into disuse.\n\n===Technicolor===\nAfter experimenting from 1915 to 1921 with [[additive color]] systems that filmed and projected the two color components simultaneously, rather than in rapid alternation (thereby eliminating Kinemacolor's color flicker and false color fringes around rapidly moving objects), the [[Technicolor]] Motion Picture Corporation developed a [[subtractive color]] print process. As in its last additive system, the camera had only one lens but used a [[beam splitter]] that allowed red and green-filtered images to be photographed simultaneously on adjacent frames of a single strip of black-and-white 35&nbsp;mm film, which ran through the camera at twice the normal rate. By skip-frame printing from the negative, two prints were made, on film stock with half the normal base thickness. They were chemically toned (i.e., the silver particles forming the black-and-white images were proportionally replaced by coloring matter) to colors roughly [[complementary color|complementary]] to the filter colors (red for the green-filtered images and vice versa), as subtractive color reproduction requires.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}</ref> They were then cemented together, base to base, into a single strip of film. No special projection equipment was needed.\n\n[[File:The-gulf-between-surviving-cell.jpg|thumb|right|A surviving two-color-component image from the first Technicolor feature film, ''[[The Gulf Between]]'' (1917)<!-- Although filmed for additive projection, this and the few other frames of the film that still exist have survived as early tests of Technicolor's subtractive printing process -->]]\n\nThe first publicly shown film using this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious all-Technicolor feature was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].\n\nIn 1928, the system was refined by the adoption of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single one-sided print, thus eliminating the complication of attaching two prints back to back and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.<ref>Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}</ref>\n\nTechnicolor's system was popular for a number of years, but it was an expensive process: shooting cost three times as much as black-and-white photography and printing costs were also much higher. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by the major studios, but then Technicolor introduced a new process which recorded all three primary colors. Utilizing a [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] sandwiched between two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was split into two paths to expose three black-and-white films (two of them in [[bipack]]), one each to record the densities for red, green and blue.<ref name=\"afitech\">Slide, Anthony. (1990) \"Technicolor\" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338\u2013340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}</ref>\n\nThe three negatives were printed to gelatin matrix films, which were processed with a selectively hardening developer, treated to remove the silver, and hot-washed to leave only a gelatin relief of the images. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density silver print of the black-and-white negative for the green component, and including the soundtrack and frame lines, was made and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (the inclusion of a \"black\" image was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrix for each color was soaked in its complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), then each in succession was brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, thus reproducing a nearly complete spectrum of color, unlike previous two-color processes.<ref name=\"awsm\">Hart, Martin (2003). \"[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor6.htm The History of Technicolor]\" Widescreenmuseum.com.

The first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first all-color feature in \"New Technicolor\" was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).<ref name=\"encyclopedia\" />\n\nThe proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent.<ref>David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton & Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}</ref> The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\n\n==Sound era==\n{{Main|Sound film}}\n[[File:The Jazz Singer 1927 Poster.jpg|thumb|''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), was the first full-length film with synchronized sound.]]\nInitially, there were technical difficulties in synchronizing images with sound. However, there was still significant interest in motion pictures for films to be produced without sound. The era from the 1890s to the late 1920s, is commonly referred to as the silent era of film. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film.\n\nExperimentation with [[sound film]] technology, both for recording and playback, was virtually constant throughout the silent era, but the twin problems of accurate synchronization and sufficient amplification had been difficult to overcome (Eyman, 1997). In 1926, Hollywood studio [[Warner Bros.]] introduced the \"[[Vitaphone]]\" system, producing short films of live entertainment acts and public figures and adding [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded sound]] effects and orchestral scores to some of its major features.\n\nDuring late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film.<ref>Note: It has been claimed that this was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'', which consisted of projected slides and moving pictures synchronized with phonograph records of talks and music. There is apparently no evidence that the synchronization was anything more than loose and approximate \u2014 adequate for providing musical accompaniment or narration appropriate to the scene being shown on the screen, but not lip-synchronous on-screen speech or singing \u2014 or that any simultaneous filming and sound recording was involved.</ref> The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as Vitaphone were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods such as Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].\n\n== Digital film ==\n{{main|Digital cinematography|Digital cinema}}\nDigital cinematography, the process of capturing film images using [[digital image sensor]]s rather than through film stock, has largely replaced analog film technology.

[[Motion pictures]] were initially exhibited as a fairground novelty and developed into one of the most important tools of [[communication]] and [[entertainment]] in the 20th century. Major developments in motion picture technology have included the adoption of [[synchronized motion picture sound]], [[color motion picture film]], and the adoption of [[digital film]] technologies to replace physical [[film stock]] at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors. \n\n==Development of motion picture technology==\n\n{{Main|Precursors of film}}\nThe [[technology]] of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of [[projector|projection]], [[lens (optics)|lens]]es, [[photography]] and [[optics]].\nEarly techniques that involve motion and/or projection include:\n*[[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|Shadowgraphy]] (probably in practice since prehistoric times)\n*[[Camera obscura]] (a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times)\n*[[Shadow play|Shadow puppetry]] (possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China)\n*[[Magic lantern]] (developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s)\n*stroboscopic \"[[persistence of vision]]\" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868) \n\nLive projection of moving images occur in the [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that may have been used artistically since prehistory. The use of a lens in a camera obscura has been dated back to 1550.<ref name=Ilardi>{{cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|publisher=American Philosophical Society|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|year=2007|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC/page/n231 220]|quote=Cardano De subtilitate libri camera obscura.|isbn=9780871692597}}</ref> Mobile camera obscura devices were used since the early 17th century, first in tents and not much later in wooden boxes. The box-type camera would be adapted into a photographic camera in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nIn or before 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. It projected slides that were usually painted in color on glass. A 1659 sketch by Huygens indicates that moving images may have been part of the earliest screenings. Around 1790 multi-media [[phantasmagoria]] spectacles were developed. Rear projection, animated slides, multiple projectors (superimposition), mobile projectors (on tracks or handheld), projection on smoke, sounds, odors and even electric shocks were used to frighten audiences with a convincing ghost horror experience. In the 19th century several other popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, et cetera) or that showed for instance falling snow or the planets and their moons revolving.\n\nMany aspects of cinema are closely related to theatre. The term \"photoplay\", used in the early days of cinema, reflects ideas of motion pictures as filmed plays. Technologies used for the theatre, such as stage lighting and all kinds of [[special effects]] were automatically adopted for use in front of cameras.\n\n====1832\u20131833: Stroboscopic animation principle====\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Animated GIF of ''Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe'' No. X (Trentsensky & Vieweg 1833)]]\nThe basic stroboscopic principle that allowed the creation of motion pictures was discovered by [[Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau|Joseph Plateau]] in Belgium around December 1832 and published in January 1833. His invention \u2013 later known as the fantascope or [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] \u2013 was a cardboard disc with slits through which the viewer could watch a rapid succession of sequential drawings (photography wasn't introduced yet) reflected in a mirror. If a ph\u00e9nakisticope disc spins fast enough it invisibly replaces each picture by the next one and the viewer sees figures in fluent motion. A very similar \"Stroboscope Disc\" was independently invented in Austria by [[Simon von Stampfer]] around the same time (probably some weeks later). Stampfer also mentioned several possible variations of his [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] invention, including a cylinder (similar to the later ''[[zoetrope]]'') as well as a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (somewhat similar to film) and a theater-like frame (much like the later [[praxinoscope]] theatre).\n\n====1833\u20131843: Early stroboscopic animation projector concepts====\nStampfer also suggested using the stroboscopic principle on \"transparencies\" and Plateau thought it might find application in phantasmagoria. It seemed a simple and logical next step, but in practice it turned out to be relatively complicated. Apart from mica and glass there were hardly any transparent materials that could be used and it took years before mechanisms were developed that enabled fluent animation to be projected.\n\nIn 1843, T.W. Naylor (an experimenter from Newcastle about whom little else is known) published details and an illustration of his plan for a \"Phantasmagoria for the projection of moving figures\" (by then, the word \"phantasmagoria\" was often used for a type of magic lanterns). It would use an [[Argand lamp]] or [[Drummond light]] to project sequential images from a rotating glass disk. A shutter disk would be mounted on the same axis as the picture disk to have its holes coincide with pictures when turned with a hand-crank. Naylor suggested tracing the pictures from readily available printed phenakisticopes, colouring them with translucent colours mixed with oil-varnish and covering the remaining portion of the disk with thick black paint.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=3u01AQAAMAAJ&dq=%22t.w.%20naylor%22&pg=PA319#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Mechanics' Magazine and Journal of Science, Arts, and Manufactures|date=1843|publisher=Knight and Lacey|language=en}}</ref> Nothing else has been found regarding Naylor's machine, so it remains uncertain whether it was ever even constructed.\n\nFranz von Uchatius developed two phenakisticope-based projectors, the first around 1851 and the second was demonstrated to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1853.<ref name=Herbertproj1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelPROJECTINGpart1.htm|title=PROJECTION Phenakistoscope 1|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nFrom around 1853 until the 1890s J. Duboscq in Paris marketed different models of a projection ph\u00e9nakisticope. It had a glass disc with a diameter of 34 centimeters for the pictures and a separate disc with four lenses. The discs rotated at different speeds.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/phenakistiscope-de-projectionap-95-1631.html |title=Ph\u00e9nakistiscope de projection (AP-95-1631) |language=French |publisher=La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThomas Ross developed a small transparent ph\u00e9nakisticope system, called ''Wheel of life'', which fitted inside a standard magic lantern slide. A first version, patented in 1869, had a glass disc with eight phases of a movement and a counter-rotating glass shutter disc with eight apertures. The discs depicted Ice Skaters, Fishes, Giant's Ladder, Bottle Imp and other subjects. An improved version had 13 images and a single slot shutter disc, and received British Patent 2685 on 10 October 1871.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8085514/ross-wheel-of-life-magic-lantern-slide-magic-lantern-slide |title=Ross 'Wheel of Life' magic lantern slide |publisher=Science Museum Group |location=London |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1849-1860s: Photography in motion===\nDuring the first decades after the introduction of photography in 1839, this new technique was occasionally combined with ph\u00e9nakisticopes and proto-[[zoetrope]]s, relatively often with stereoscopic pairs. [[Stereoscope|Stereoscopic]] photography, which became very popular in the early 1850s, led to the belief that photography could be further developed into a perfect illusion of reality. Photographic recordings with motion and colour were the logical next steps. Before the necessary photographic emulsions and  mechanics were fast enough to capture a photographic sequence in real-time, early attempts recorded simulated motion sequences by photographing different poses and/or positions separately. This technique became known as [[stop motion]] much later.\n\nIn 1849, Joseph Plateau published a note about improvements for the fantascope. He combined the stroboscopic disc with aspects of his [[anorthoscope]] to create a 27 cm translucent disc (oiled paper on a cardboard frame) that was lit from behind and had a stroboscopic 4-slit black metal shutter disc in front. The pictures, 16 in Plateau's example, were designed with a 4 to 5 anamorphic width to compensate the deformation of the resulting image. The animation could be seen with both eyes by several people at the same time, with greatly improved image quality. A screen behind the translucent disc blocked the light, except for a cutout trapezoid area that corresponded with the space where the figures were visible at the proper position. A gear system for the rotation ensured that the image would appear in the right area. Plateau used the translucency of the disc to create light effects in the designs. One extant disc, made in collaboration with painter [[Jean Baptiste Madou]], shows a demon's head blowing on a glowing coal. Plateau stated that the illusion could be advanced even further with an idea communicated to him by Charles Wheatstone: a combination of fantascope and stereoscope. Plateau believed two copies of his improved fantascope could be adapted to deliver stereoscopic images to Wheatstone's reflecting stereoscope. He thought the construction of a sequential set of stereoscopic image pairs would be more difficult. Wheatstone had suggested using photographs on paper of a solid object, for instance a statuette. Plateau concluded that for this purpose 16 plaster models could be made with 16 regular modifications. He believed such a project would take much time and careful effort, but would be well wort it because of the expected marvelous results.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9fZUAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA254&ots=ciVL2_BZaf&dq=%22persistance%20des%20impressions%20de%20la%20retine%E2%80%9D%20bulletin%20academie%20royale%22&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Bulletins de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique|last=Belgique|first=Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de|date=1849|publisher=Hayez|language=fr}}</ref> Unfortunately, the plan was never executed, possibly because Plateau became almost completely blind by this time. Eventually the idea was communicated to instrumentmaker [[Jules Duboscq]], who since 1850 very successfully marketed a stereoscope with lenses in collaboration with [[David Brewster]] (he also sold Wheatstone's version with mirrors, became the French publisher for Plateau's fantascope and offered a projector on wheels for phantasmagoria, among many other optical instruments).<ref>Duboscq catalogue 1851</ref>\n\nDuboscq patented the st\u00e9r\u00e9oscope on 16 February 1852, with mention of a projection variation. On 12 November 1852 he applied for an addition certificate to include his \"St\u00e9r\u00e9oscope-fantascope, ou B\u00efoscope\".<ref>Brevet d'Invention 13069</ref> Basically a combination of Plateau's standard fantascope and the stereoscope, it used two small mirrors in different angles next to each other that reflected stereoscopic image pairs (printed above each other on the stroboscopic disc) into the stereoscope viewer. Of three planned variations only one was actually produced, but it wasn't very successful commercially. Only one extant disc is known, from the Joseph Plateau estate kept at the Ghent University.<ref name=dorikens>{{cite book|title=Joseph Plateau 1801\u20131883: Living between Art and Science|last=Dorikens|first=Maurice|year=2001}}</ref> It has stereoscopic sets of a sequence of photographic images of a machine in action. No original viewing device has resurfaced, but parts of it are known from an illustration in an 1853 advertisement.\n\nIn 1851, [[Antoine Claudet]] wrote to French magazine ''La Lumi\u00e8re'' in response to a patent given to the Mayer brothers for their \"multiplicateur\", which photographed multiple (identical) images onto a single plate (a technique that created the [[carte de visite]] format that was very popular in the 1860s). Claudet claimed to have invented something very similar in 1844, with results exhibited at the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844]], including a self portrait that showed 12 sides of his face.<ref>''La Lumi\u00e8re'' 1851-03-09</ref> Before the end of 1851, Claudet claimed to have created a stereoscope that showed people in motion.<ref>''La Lumi\u00e8re'' 1851-11-16</ref> The stereo viewer could show a motion of two phases repetitively. During the next two years, Claudet worked on a camera that would record stereoscopic pairs for four different poses (patented in 1853).<ref>British patent 711</ref> Claudet found that the stereoscopic effect didn't work properly in this device, but believed the illusion of motion was successful.<ref>Le Cosmos 1852-10-03</ref> \n\nInstrument maker [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] (or possibly a lesser known Frederic Wenham) would claim in 1895 that he had already made a series of ten stereoscopic images to be viewed on two [[phenakistiscope]]s in 1852.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=C1dgJ3-y1ZsC&lpg=PA201&dq=%22english%20mechanic%22%20wenham&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q=wenham&f=false |title = Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838\u20131952|isbn = 0813172713|last1 = Zone|first1 = Ray|date = December 2007}}</ref><ref>http://www.billjayonphotography.com/UpTheNileWithFrancisFrith.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1855, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak]]'s published an article about his Stereophoroskop and other experiments aimed at stereoscopic moving images. He mentioned a method of sticking needles in a [[phenakistiscope|stroboscopic disc]], so that they would appear as if moving in and out of the cardboard when animated. He supposed that this principle provided endless possibilities to make different 3D animations. He then introduced two methods to animate stereoscopic pairs of images, one was basically a stereo viewer using two stroboscopic discs and the other was more or less similar to the later [[zoetrope]] (but in a vertical position with horizontal slits). Czermak explained how suitable stereoscopic photographs could be made by recording a series of models, with an example of a growing pyramid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit15017/index.meta&viewMode=auto&pn=1|last=Czermak|title=Das Stereophoroskop|year=1855|language=German}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 1850s the first examples of [[instantaneous photography]] appeared, which further inspired hope for the possibilities of motion photography. In 1860, [[John Herschel]] envisioned the stereoscopic representation of scenes in action. He figured that photography could already, or would soon be able to take snap-shots in one tenth of a second and that a mechanism was possible \"by which a prepared plate may be presented, focused, impressed, displaced, secured in the dark, and replaced by another within two or three tenths of a second\". Apparently without knowledge of Duboscq's st\u00e9r\u00e9ofantascope, Herschel believed the \"phenakistoscope\" (sic) could very well be adapted into a viewer for stereoscopic motion photography pairs. He also had high hopes for the development of colour photography, since he himself had already obtained promising results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044096812060&view=1up&seq=443|title=The photographic news.  v.3\u20134 (1859\u20131860).|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, Joseph Charles d'Almeida published descriptions of two methods that he had successfully developed to project stereoscopic images. The first was an [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] method with red and green glasses, the second used the [[stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic principle]] to alternately present each picture to the corresponding eye in quick succession. D'Almeida had started work on combining this method with the principles of the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111368q|title=Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie|date=1858|website=Gallica|language=EN|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 February 1860 Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices.

In his application he stated: \"This has frequently been done with plane pictures but\nhas never been, with stereoscopic pictures\". He used three sets of stereoscopic photographs in a sequence with some duplicates to regulate the flow of a simple repetitive motion, but also described a system for very large series of pictures of complicated motion.<ref>https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US31357.pdf</ref><ref>https://archive.org/stream/howmotionpictur00croygoog#page/n28/mode/2up/search/kinematoscope</ref>\n\nAround 1865, a disc with nine oval photographic images of [[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b]] (1787\u20131869) turning around, currently in the collection of the National Technical Museum in Prague, was probably created by the physiologist himself.<ref>https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/cine/2014-v24-n2-3-cine01417/1025153ar/</ref> Purkyn\u011b reportedly used the disc to entertain his grandchildren and show them how he, an old professor, could turn around at great speed.<ref>Ludv\u00edk Sou\u010dek, Jak se sv\u011btlo nau\u010dilo kreslit (How the light learned to draw), SNDK, Prague, 1963, pp. 106\u20137.</ref>\n\n===1874-1890s: The chronophotograpers and Donisthorpe===\n{{Main| Chronophotography}}\n\n[[Jules Janssen]] developed a large [[Janssen revolver|photographic revolver]] to document the stages of the [[transit of Venus]] in 1874, regarded as an important method to determine the [[Astronomical Unit]] (the distance between earth and the sun). Several copies of the device were used at different geographic points. Many negative images of the different phases of Venus passing in front of the sun were captured on glass discs, in an early form of [[timelapse photography]]. Unfortunately, the quality was not sufficient for a calculation of the Astronomical Unit. Several photographic revolver discs with images have been preserved, but research concluded that all of the known discs contained test recordings of a model in front of a circular light source (or brightly lit surface). Although the photographs were most likely never intended to be presented as motion pictures, much later images of one disc were transferred and animated into a very short [[stop motion]] film. No original footage of the photographic revolver recordings of the actual Venus transit has yet resurfaced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LowU9vKZzJs|title=1874 Pierre Jules C\u00e9sar Janssen - Passage artificiel de Venus sur le Soleil|last=|first=|date=|website=Magical Motion Museum - YouTube channel|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1875 and 1876, Janssen suggested that the revolver could also be used to document animal locomotion, especially of birds.\n\nOn 9 November 1876, [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], filed a patent application for \"an apparatus for taking and exhibiting photographs\" that would \"facilitate the taking of a succession of photographic pictures at equal intervals of time, in order to record the changes taking place in or the movements of the object being photographed, and also by means of succession of pictures so taken of any moving object to give to the eye a presentation of the object in continuous movement as it appeared when being photographed\". The camera would have a mechanism to move photographic plates one by one past a lens and shutter to be exposed for the necessary time and then dropped or carried into a receiver. The recorded images would be printed at equal distances apart on a strip of paper. The strip was to be wound between cylinders and carried past the eye of the observer, with a stroboscopic device to expose each picture momentarily. Such photographic strips only became commercially available several years later.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mgc_x5ph3sEC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=kin%C3%A9tiscope&source=bl&ots=bsSzStADY1&sig=ACfU3U0WgFe9HzWJ8dl5C8T0H-FTdjiVhA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix-6OplbLnAhVLb1AKHUC1DFEQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph|last=Herbert|first=Stephen|date=1998|publisher=The Projection Box|isbn=978-0-9523941-3-6|language=en}}</ref> \n\n[[Thomas Edison]] demonstrated his [[phonograph]] on 29 November 1877, after previous announcements of the device for recording and replaying sound had been published earlier in the year. An article in ''Scientific American'' concluded \"It is already possible, by ingenious optical contrivances, to throw stereoscopic photographs of people on screens in full view of an audience. Add the talking phonograph to counterfeit their voices and it would be difficult to carry the illusion of real presence much further\". Donisthorpe announced in the 24 January 1878 edition of ''Nature'' that he would advance that conception: \"By combining the phonograph with the kinesigraph I will undertake not only to produce a talking picture of Mr. Gladstone which, with motionless lips and unchanged expression shall positively recite his latest anti-Turkish speech in his own voice and tone. Not only this, but the life size photograph itself shall move and gesticulate precisely as he did when making the speech, the words and gestures corresponding as in real life.\"<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/nature17unkngoog | page=[https://archive.org/details/nature17unkngoog/page/n363 242] | quote=kinesigraph. | title=Nature| publisher=Macmillan Journals Limited | last1=Lockyer| first1=Sir Norman| year=1878}}</ref> A Dr. Phipson repeated this idea in a French photography magazine, but renamed the device \"Kin\u00e9tiscope\" to reflect the viewing purpose rather than the recording option.

Under the sponsorship of [[Leland Stanford]], he photographed Stanford's horses in rapid motion by using a series of separate still cameras. A demonstration took place on June 15 at Stanford's stock farm in [[Palo Alto, California]], with the press present. The cameras were arranged in a line parallel to the edge of the track and spaced 27 inches apart. Each camera shutter was triggered by a thread as the horse passed and each exposure was made in only one thousandth of a second.<ref name=\"BC\">{{Cite book|last=Clegg|first=Brian|title=The Man Who Stopped Time|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10112-7|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309101127}}</ref> Soon after the public demonstration the pictures were published as a series of cabinet cards, entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''. \n\n[[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]] invented a chronophotographic gun in 1882, which was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, recording the different phases of movements onto a single plate. He used the chronophotographic gun for studying animal and human locomotion.\n\nSoon after Muybridge's sequential pictures were published, or at least since January 1879, there were several people who placed these in [[zoetrope]]s to watch them in motion.<ref>http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muybZOETROPES.htm</ref> These were possibly the very first viewings of photographic motion pictures that were recorded in real-time. The quality of the pictures was limited and the figures were mostly seen as silhouettes, often furthered by retouching of the pictures to get rid of photographic irregularities.\n\nFrom 1879 to 1893 Muybridge gave lectures in which he projected silhouettes of his pictures with a device he called a [[zoopraxiscope]]. It used pictures that were painted onto glass discs. This can be regarded as an early [[movie projector]] and a precursor to [[rotoscoping]]. \n\nAnother early projector was built by [[Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz]] in 1887. His [[Electrotachyscope]] used 24 images on a rotating glass disk.<ref>''Faszination der Bewegung: Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz zwischen Photographie und Kino'' p. 185, Deac Rossell. {{ISBN|3-87877-774-4}}</ref> In 1894 his invention projected moving images<ref>''Industry, liberty, and a vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's kinesigraph'', Stephen Herbert, p. 13, {{ISBN|0-9523941-3-8}}</ref> in Berlin.\n\nPrompted by the much publicized successes of Muybridge's photographic sequences and related ideas, inventors in the late 19th century began to realize that the making and showing of photographic 'moving pictures' of a more useful or even indefinite length was a practical possibility. Many people working in the field followed the international developments closely through information in periodicals, patent filings, personal contact with colleagues and/or by getting their hands on new equipment.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/579606/Serpentine_dance_Inter-national_connections_in_early_cinema?email_work_card=view-paper</ref>\n\n===1886\u20131889: Le Prince's motion pictures===\n[[File:Roundhay Garden Scene.ogv|''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'' 1888, the first known motion-picture film.|thumb|right]]\nThe oldest known proper motion picture cameras<!-- a multi-lensed one was patented in 1864, although probably never built --> were developed by the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Louis Le Prince]] in the 1880s, while working in [[Leeds]], [[England]]. On 2 November 1886, he applied for a US patent for a \"Method of and apparatus for producing animated pictures of natural scenery and life\", which was granted on 10 January 1888. It described a multi-lens camera in detail and provided some information on a projector, but construction details for the projector were planned to be patented separately. The idea for a two-fold apparatus was also included. The camera could be fitted with three, four, eight, nine, sixteen or more lenses and was illustrated with sixteen lenses in the patent documents. The images were to be recorded as negatives on a pair of sensitive films, stored on two lower drums and mechanically transported without interruption to two upper drums, past lenses and successively operated shutters. The sensitive film could be \"an endless sheet of insoluble gelatine coated with bromide emulsion or any convenient ready-made quick-acting paper, such as Eastman's paper film\". For longer recordings, the receiver could be suited with extra supply boxes after the first boxes were exhausted. With sixteen lenses the camera could record 960 images per minute (16 per second). The projector would have positive transparencies on flexible material, \"such as gelatine, mica, horn &c\" to be \"adjusted on a pair of endless metallic ribbons accurately punctured with small round holes\" and guided past the lenses and shutters by pins on drums. Shorter sequences could be projected from glass discs instead of the films on drums. Le Prince intended the pictures to \"pass through the hands of artits\" to be suitably colored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=00376247&IDKey=94442ED43DB9&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0376247.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0376247%2526RS%3DPN%2F0376247|title=Method of and apparatus for producing animated pictures of natural scenery and life|last=|first=|date=10 January 1888|website=|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite patent|title=le prince|gdate=1888-01-10|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US376247A/en}}</ref> Although the camera was capable of 'capturing' motion, it was not a complete success because each lens photographed the subject from a slightly different viewpoint, with the result that foreground elements in the [[Movie projector|projected]] scene wove about relative to each other and to the background.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn May 1887,<ref name=\"Naughton\">[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/LE_PRINCE_BIO.html Adventures in CyberSound: Le Prince, Louis Aim\u00e9 Augustin], Dr Russell Naughton (using source: Michael Harvey, NMPFT Pioneers of Early Cinema: 1.

He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie]] on 4 June 1880, but did not market his ''praxinoscope a projection'' before 1882. He then further developed the device into the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique]] which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting colourful images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. The strip could be manually moved past a lens and mirror projection system, sometimes back and forth to show repetitive motions as desired for certain scenes. Some sound effects were synchronized by electro-magnetic devices, triggered by metal parts on the strip, while a score with some songs were to be performed live. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin in Paris.\n\n=== Development of film stock ===\nAnother early pioneer, working at roughly the same time as Le Prince, was [[William Friese-Greene]]. He began to experiment with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of [[celluloid]]. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera. This was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British ''Photographic News'' on February 28, 1890.<ref>Braun, Marta, (1992) ''Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830\u20131904)'', p. 190, Chicago: University of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-07173-1}}''';''' Robinson, David, (1997)   ''From Peepshow to Palace: The Birth of American Film'', p. 28, New York and Chichester, West Sussex, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-10338-7}})</ref> He gave a public demonstration in 1890 of his device, but the low [[frame rate]] combined with the device's apparent unreliability made an unfavourable impression.\n\nDonisthorpe's interest in moving pictures was revived when he heard about the successful experiments of [[Louis Le Prince]], who was then working in Donsithorpe's home town of [[Leeds]]. In 1889, he took out a patent, jointly with [[William Carr Crofts]], for a camera using celluloid roll film and a projector system; they then made a short film of the bustling traffic in [[London]]'s [[Trafalgar Square]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/donisthorpe|title=Wordsworth Donisthorpe: British inventor and political activist|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Paul T |last=Burns |title=The History of The Discovery of Cinematography \u2013 1885 \u2013 1889 |url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/1885.htm |accessdate=2009-05-10 |postscript=<!--None-->}} and {{Cite web |title=Ten Remaining Frames Of Donisthorpe's 1890 'Trafalgar Square' Footage Come To Life |url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/images/trafalgarsquare_animation_small.gif |format=GIF |accessdate=2009-05-10 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert, S.|year=1998|title=Industry, Liberty, and a Vision: Wordsworth Donisthorpe's Kinesigraph|publisher=[[The Projection Box]]|location=London|isbn=0-9523941-3-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickson greeting.jpg|thumb|Film still from ''[[Dickson Greeting]]''. In May 1891, it became the first American film shown to a public audience.]]\nAnother, more successful apparatus was invented by the Scottish inventor and employee of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], [[W. K. L. Dickson]]. His camera, called the [[Kinetograph]], was patented in 1891 and took a series of instantaneous photographs on standard Eastman Kodak photographic emulsion coated on to a transparent [[Celluloid|celluloid strip]] 35&nbsp;mm wide. The celluloid blocks were thinly sliced, then removed with heated pressure plates. After this, they were coated with a photosensitive gelatin emulsion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nIn 1893 at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], [[Thomas Edison]] revealed the '[[Kinetoscope]]' to the public. The machine was contained within a large box, and only permitted the images to be viewed by one person at a time looking into it through a peephole, after starting the machine by inserting a coin. The parlours were supplied with film snippets photographed by Dickson, in Edison's [[Edison's Black Maria|\"Black Maria\"]] studio. These sequences recorded both mundane incidents, such as ''[[Fred Ott's Sneeze]]'', and entertainment acts, such as acrobats, [[music hall]] performers and boxing demonstrations. The [[Kinetoscope]] [[Peep show|peep-show]] parlor first opened on April 14, 1894, and was the first commercial exhibition of film. Kinetoscope parlors soon spread successfully to Europe. Edison, however, never attempted to patent these instruments on the other side of the Atlantic, since they relied so greatly on [[Precursors of film|previous experiments and innovations]] from Britain and Europe.\n\nThe Pleograph, invented by Polish emigre [[Kazimierz Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski]] in 1894<ref>Maciej Ilowiecki, \"Dzieje nauki polskiej\", Wydawnictwo Interpress, Warszawa 1981, {{ISBN|8322318766}}, p.202 (Polish).</ref> was another early camera. It also doubled up as a projector. The apparatus used a rectangle of celluloid with perforations between several parallel rows of images. Using an improved pleograph, Pr\u00f3szynski shot short films showing scenes of life in [[Warsaw]], such as people skating in the park.\n\n===Flicker problem and solutions===\nBefore 1902, the quality of the experience of films was usually troubled by an obvious flicker in the projected image. The problem arose from the combination of the shutter and the intermittent transport of the film strip. Light came through the shutter at the moment a frame was very shortly held still at the projector gate to get a clear image without [[motion blur]]. Light was blocked at the moment the film was quicly advanced to the next frame. Intermittently blocking the light was necessary for the stroboscopic effect that was widely known from the ph\u00e9nakisticope and zoetrope. The strain of starting and stopping also often caused damage to the film strip and could cause the system to jam (often with the result of burning the combustible film material as it was exposed to the heat of the lamp for too long). Eventually the solution was found in a three-bladed shutter that not just blocked the light intermittently during film transport, but more often and also during projection. The first three-bladed shutter was developed by Theodor P\u00e4tzold and went in production with Messter in 1902.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/378378/Double_Think_The_Cinema_and_Magic_Lantern_Culture</ref>\n\n==Development of the film industry==\n\n===Commercial cinema===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-035-15, Berlin, Wintergarten.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]] was the site of the first [[Movie theater|cinema]], with a short movie presented by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in November 1895]]\n[[Image:Cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The first film poster, for the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers']] screening of ''[[L'Arroseur arros\u00e9]]'' in 1895.]]\n\nThe [[Eidoloscope]], devised by [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]] for the [[Woodville Latham|Latham]] family, was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895 and opened to the paying public on May 20, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo-Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from [[Madison Square Garden]]'s roof on May 4.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Streible|first1=Dan|title=Fight Pictures: A History of Boxing and Early Cinema|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520940581|pages=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bpc1fk5T5dYC&pg=PA46|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=2008-04-11}}</ref> It was the first commercial projection.\n\nAnother commercial public motion-picture film presentation was made by [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]] in Berlin, who projected with their apparatus \"Bioscop\", a flickerfree duplex construction, November 1 through 31, 1895.

The Edison company took up a projector developed by Armat and Jenkins, the \"Phantoscope\", which was renamed the Vitascope, and it joined various projecting machines made by other people to show the 480&nbsp;mm width films being made by the Edison company and others in France and the UK.\n\nInitially, a lack of standardization meant that film producers used a variety of different film widths and projection speeds, but after a few years the 35-mm wide Edison film, and the 16-frames-per-second projection speed of the Lumi\u00e8re Cin\u00e9matographe became the standard.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n[[Birt Acres]] designed the first [[Home movies|camera for amateur use]] in 1898.

Smith]] and [[Cecil Hepworth]], who in 1899, began turning out 100 films a year, with his company becoming the largest on the British scene.\n\nThe [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] in Germany was the first large-scale film studio in the world, founded 1912, and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]] with its several establishments of large studios in the early 20th century.\n\n===First cinemas===\n{{Main|Movie theater}}\nInitially, commercial screenings of motion-pictures for the public were put on in existing [[theatre]]s and [[music hall]]s as a novelty, but the main methods of exhibition quickly became either as an item on the programmes of variety theatres, or by traveling showmen in tent theatres, which they took around the fairs in country towns. It became the practice for the producing companies to sell prints outright to the exhibitors, at so much per foot, regardless of the subject. Typical prices initially were 15 cents a foot in the United States, and one shilling a foot in Britain. [[Hand-colouring|Hand-coloured]] films, which were being produced of the most popular subjects before 1900, cost 2 to 3 times as much per foot. There were a few producers, such as the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, who did not sell their films, but exploited them solely with their own exhibition units.\n\nThe first public motion-picture film presentation in the world was done by [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]] at the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]], who projected with their apparatus \"Bioscop\", a flickerfree duplex construction, from November 1 through 31, 1895.\n\n[[Image:Auditorium Theatre in Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] in 1910 showing \"The Heroine of Mafeking\".]]\nThe first theatres dedicated to motion-pictures were established at the turn of the century, soon becoming known as [[Movie theater|cinemas]]. The [[Vitascope Hall]] in [[New Orleans]] was opened in 1896 as one of the first such establishments. It showed two exhibitions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n\nAnother early establishment was the [[Islington|Islington Palace]], originally built in 1869 as part of the [[Royal Agricultural Hall]] complex. The concert hall was converted into a full-time cinema in 1901, a year after it showed its first film.<ref>{{cite book|title=Penguin Pocket On This Day|publisher=Penguin Reference Library|isbn=0-14-102715-0|year=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMYo4Abel2EC|title=Cinemas of the World: Film and Society from 1895 to the Present|author=James Chapman|year=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|page=|isbn=9781861895745}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon]]<!-- capitalized as a proper name here because referring to the original one --> was the first successful permanent theatre showing only films, and opened in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1905. By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these \"nickelodeons\" in operation worldwide.\n\n\n==Color films==\n{{Main|Color motion picture film}}\n\n===Additive process===\n[[File:Lee and Turner Colour Projector, 1902.

The Kinemacolor camera had red and green filters in the apertures of its rotating shutter, so that alternating red-filtered and green-filtered views of the subject were recorded on consecutive frames of the [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The Kinemacolor projector did the same thing in reverse, projecting the frames of the black-and-white print alternately through the red and green filters in its rotating shutter.\n\nBoth devices were operated at twice the usual frame rate to reduce the color flicker (technically known as \"color bombardment\") produced by non-simultaneous projection of the two color components, a defect which some viewers barely noticed but which others found obtrusive and headache-inducing. A related defect was the most obvious shortcoming of this process: because the two components had not been photographed at the same time, as pairs of frames, rapidly moving subjects did not adequately match up from one frame to the next when projected on the screen, resulting in color \"fringes\" or in extreme cases vividly colored \"ghosts\". A white dog wagging its tail in front of a dark background could appear to have several tails, variously red, green and white.<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/kinemacolor-book1.htm Widescreen Museum]</ref>\n\n[[Image:kinemacolor1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kinemacolor]], 1911 (appearance of projected image simulated by a color composite of two consecutive frames)]]\nThe first motion picture exhibited in Kinemacolor was an eight-minute short titled ''[[A Visit to the Seaside]]'', which was trade-shown in September 1908. The general public first saw Kinemacolor in a program of 21 short films shown on 26 February 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London.  The process was first seen in the US on 11 December 1909, at an exhibition staged by Smith and Urban at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.<ref>http://bioscopic.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/colourful-stories-no-11-kinemacolor-in-america</ref>\n\nKinemacolor released the first drama filmed in the process, ''Checkmated'', in 1910, and the first feature-length [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', in 1912.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=2360560|title=Salvage Operations of S.S. Oceana|description=Produced by the Natural Colour Kinematograph Co., Brighton}}</ref> \nKinemacolor projectors were installed in some 300 cinemas in Britain, and 54 dramatic films were produced. Four dramatic short films were made in Kinemacolor in the US in 1912\u20131913,<ref>''La Tosca'' (1912), ''Mission Bells'' (1913), ''The Rivals'' (1913), and ''The Scarlet Letter'' (1913).</ref> and one in Japan in 1914. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors.\n\nA variant method was promoted by [[William Friese-Greene]]. He called his additive color system \"Biocolour\". It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes. An ordinary projector could therefore be used, if it would bear being cranked at a sufficient rate. Like Kinemacolor, Biocolour suffered from noticeable color flicker and from red and green fringing when the subject was in rapid motion.\n\nIn 1913, French film entrepreneur and inventor [[L\u00e9on Gaumont]] unveiled Chronochrome, a full-color additive system. The camera used three lenses with color filters to photograph red, green and blue color components simultaneously on consecutive frames of one strip of 35&nbsp;mm black-and-white film. The projector had a corresponding triad of lenses. To reduce the strain imposed on the film as the mechanism in each device pulled it down three frames at a time, frame height was reduced from the usual four [[film perforations]] to three, resulting in a widescreen image format identical with the modern 16:9 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nChronochrome's color quality was impressive, as surviving specimens attest,<ref>[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/gaumont.htm Gaumont Chronochrome at the WideScreen Museum]. Retrieved 24 June 2016.</ref> and because the three frames were exposed and projected simultaneously, Kinemacolor's color bombardment and color fringes around moving objects were avoided. However, because the camera's three lenses could not all photograph the scene from exactly the same viewpoint, subjects that were too near the camera would exhibit color fringes if the registration of the three projected images was optimized for the background of the scene, and vice versa. A method of notching the prints to trigger automatic adjustment of the projection optics was invented, but expert supervision of the presentation was still a requisite. Light loss due to the color filters and the constrained dimensions of the projection lenses resulted in an image that was too dim for showing in a large auditorium unless a highly reflective metalized screen or rear-projection onto a translucent screen was used, and either solution created a \"hot spot\" that made the views from the side sections of the auditorium very unsatisfactory. The films were seldom screened outside of Gaumont's own cinemas and the system soon fell into disuse.\n\n===Technicolor===\nAfter experimenting from 1915 to 1921 with [[additive color]] systems that filmed and projected the two color components simultaneously, rather than in rapid alternation (thereby eliminating Kinemacolor's color flicker and false color fringes around rapidly moving objects), the [[Technicolor]] Motion Picture Corporation developed a [[subtractive color]] print process. As in its last additive system, the camera had only one lens but used a [[beam splitter]] that allowed red and green-filtered images to be photographed simultaneously on adjacent frames of a single strip of black-and-white 35&nbsp;mm film, which ran through the camera at twice the normal rate. By skip-frame printing from the negative, two prints were made, on film stock with half the normal base thickness. They were chemically toned (i.e., the silver particles forming the black-and-white images were proportionally replaced by coloring matter) to colors roughly [[complementary color|complementary]] to the filter colors (red for the green-filtered images and vice versa), as subtractive color reproduction requires.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}</ref> They were then cemented together, base to base, into a single strip of film. No special projection equipment was needed.\n\n[[File:The-gulf-between-surviving-cell.jpg|thumb|right|A surviving two-color-component image from the first Technicolor feature film, ''[[The Gulf Between]]'' (1917)<!-- Although filmed for additive projection, this and the few other frames of the film that still exist have survived as early tests of Technicolor's subtractive printing process -->]]\n\nThe first publicly shown film using this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious all-Technicolor feature was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].\n\nIn 1928, the system was refined by the adoption of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single one-sided print, thus eliminating the complication of attaching two prints back to back and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.<ref>Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}</ref>\n\nTechnicolor's system was popular for a number of years, but it was an expensive process: shooting cost three times as much as black-and-white photography and printing costs were also much higher. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by the major studios, but then Technicolor introduced a new process which recorded all three primary colors. Utilizing a [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] sandwiched between two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was split into two paths to expose three black-and-white films (two of them in [[bipack]]), one each to record the densities for red, green and blue.<ref name=\"afitech\">Slide, Anthony. (1990) \"Technicolor\" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338\u2013340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}</ref>\n\nThe three negatives were printed to gelatin matrix films, which were processed with a selectively hardening developer, treated to remove the silver, and hot-washed to leave only a gelatin relief of the images. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density silver print of the black-and-white negative for the green component, and including the soundtrack and frame lines, was made and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (the inclusion of a \"black\" image was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrix for each color was soaked in its complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), then each in succession was brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, thus reproducing a nearly complete spectrum of color, unlike previous two-color processes.<ref name=\"awsm\">Hart, Martin (2003). \"[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor6.htm The History of Technicolor]\" Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved 2006-07-07.</ref> The first animation film to use the three-color (also called three-strip) system was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), which introduced it to an enthusiastic public. The first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first all-color feature in \"New Technicolor\" was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).<ref name=\"encyclopedia\" />\n\nThe proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent.<ref>David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton & Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}</ref> The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\n\n==Sound era==\n{{Main|Sound film}}\n[[File:The Jazz Singer 1927 Poster.jpg|thumb|''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), was the first full-length film with synchronized sound.]]\nInitially, there were technical difficulties in synchronizing images with sound. However, there was still significant interest in motion pictures for films to be produced without sound. The era from the 1890s to the late 1920s, is commonly referred to as the silent era of film. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film.\n\nExperimentation with [[sound film]] technology, both for recording and playback, was virtually constant throughout the silent era, but the twin problems of accurate synchronization and sufficient amplification had been difficult to overcome (Eyman, 1997). In 1926, Hollywood studio [[Warner Bros.]] introduced the \"[[Vitaphone]]\" system, producing short films of live entertainment acts and public figures and adding [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded sound]] effects and orchestral scores to some of its major features.\n\nDuring late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film.<ref>Note: It has been claimed that this was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'', which consisted of projected slides and moving pictures synchronized with phonograph records of talks and music. There is apparently no evidence that the synchronization was anything more than loose and approximate \u2014 adequate for providing musical accompaniment or narration appropriate to the scene being shown on the screen, but not lip-synchronous on-screen speech or singing \u2014 or that any simultaneous filming and sound recording was involved.</ref> The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as Vitaphone were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods such as Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].\n\n== Digital film ==\n{{main|Digital cinematography|Digital cinema}}\nDigital cinematography, the process of capturing film images using [[digital image sensor]]s rather than through film stock, has largely replaced analog film technology.

Its parent language is surely [[Iberian Romance languages|Iberian]], but scholars dispute whether Papiamento is derived from Portuguese and its derived [[Portuguese-based creole languages]] or [[Spanish-based creole languages|from old or new Spanish]]. Historical constraints, core vocabulary and grammatical features that Papiamento shares with [[Cape Verdean Creole]] and [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]] suggest that the basic ingredients are Portuguese,<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/kiss-of-a-slave-papiamentus-west-african-connections/oclc/43441602 Martinus, Efraim Frank (1996). \"The kiss of a slave. Papiamentu's West-African connections\". (Unpublished PhD dissertation, University of Amsterdam)]</ref> and the Spanish and Dutch influences occurred at a later time (from the 17th century onwards). Jacoba Bouschoute made a study of the many Dutch influences in Papiamento.<ref>Bouschoute, Jacoba (1969). [https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094428 \"Certain Aspects Of The Dutch Influence On Papiamentu\"]. University of British Columbia.</ref>.\n\nThe name of the language itself comes from ''papia'' or ''papear'' (\"to chat\", \"to talk\"), a word present in Portuguese and colloquial Spanish. \n\nSpain claimed dominion over the islands in the 15th century, but made little use of them after the Spanish defeat to the Netherlands as a result of [[Eighty Years' War]]. Portuguese merchants had been trading extensively in the West Indies, and with the Iberian Union, this trade extended to the Castillian West Indies, as the Spanish kings favoured the free movement of people. In 1634, the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC) took possession of the islands, deporting most of the small remaining [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] and Spanish population to the continent, and turned them into the hub of the Dutch slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean.\n\nThe first evidence of widespread use of Papiamento in Aruba can be seen through the Cura\u00e7ao official documents in the early 18th century. In the 19th century, most materials in the islands were written in Papiamento including [[Roman Catholic]] schoolbooks and hymnals. The first Papiamento newspaper was published in 1871 and was titled ''Civilisad\u00f3'' (The Civilizer). \n\nA summary of the debate on Papiamento's origins is provided in Bart Jacobs' study ''The Upper Guinea Origins of Papiamento''.<ref>Jacobs, Bart (2009a) [https://www.academia.edu/621021/The_Upper_Guinea_origins_of_Papiamentu_Linguistic_and_historical_evidence \"The Upper Guinea Origins of Papiamento: Linguistic and Historical Evidence\"]. ''Diachronica'' 26:3, 319\u2013379</ref>\nAn outline of the competing theories is provided below.\n\n=== Local development theory ===\nThere are various local development theories. One such theory proposes that Papiamento developed in the Caribbean from an original Portuguese-African [[pidgin]] used for communication between African slaves and Portuguese slave traders, with later Dutch and Spanish (and even some Arawak) influences. \n\nAnother theory is that Papiamento first evolved from the use in this region since 1499 of 'lenguas' and the first Repopulation of the ABC islands by the Spanish by the C\u00e9dula real decreed in November 1525, in which Juan Martinez de Ampu\u00e9s, factor of Espa\u00f1ola, had been granted the right to repopulate the depopulated Islas in\u00fatiles of Oroba, Islas de los Gigantes and Buon Aire. \nThe evolution of Papiamento continued under the Dutch colonisation under the influence of the 16th century Dutch, Portuguese (Brazilian) and Native American languages (Arawak en Ta\u00edno) with the second repopulation of these ABC islands under [[Peter Stuyvesant]], who arrived here from the ex-Dutch Brazilian colonies.\n\nThe Judaeo-Portuguese population of the ABC islands increased substantially after 1654, when the Portuguese recovered the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch-held territories in Northeast]] [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]{{spaced ndash}}causing most of the Portuguese-speaking Jews and their Portuguese-speaking Dutch allies and Dutch-speaking Portuguese Brazilian allies in those lands to flee from religious persecution. \nThe precise role of [[Sephardic Jew]]s in the early development is unclear, but it is certain that [[Jew]]s played a prominent role in the later development of Papiamento. Many early residents of Cura\u00e7ao were Sephardic Jews either from Portugal, Spain, Cape Verde or Portuguese Brazil. Also, after the [[Eighty Years' War]], a group of Sephardic Jews immigrated from Amsterdam. Therefore, it can be assumed that [[Judaeo-Portuguese]] was brought to the island of Cura\u00e7ao, where it gradually spread to other parts of the community. As the Jewish community became the prime merchants and traders in the area, business and everyday trading was conducted in Papiamento. While various nations owned the island and official languages changed with ownership, Papiamento became the constant language of the residents. When Netherlands opened economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia in the 18th century<ref name=Putte>[https://www.academia.edu/35221185/_Florimon_van_Putte_Dede_piki%C3%B1a_ku_su_bisi%C3%B1a_Papiamentu_Nederlands_en_de_onverwerkt_verleden_tijd._Zutphen_1999 Dede piki\u00f1a ku su bisi\u00f1a: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd.] van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers</ref> the students on Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish, and Spanish began to influence the creole language.<ref name=papia/> \nSince there was a continuous Latinisation process (Hoetink, 1987), even the elite Dutch-Protestant settlers eventually communicated better in Spanish than in Dutch. A wealth of local Spanish-language publications in the nineteenth century testify to this.\n\n=== European and African origin theory ===\nPeter Stuyvesant's appointment to the ABC islands followed his service in Brazil. He brought Indians, soldiers, etc. from Brazil to Cura\u00e7ao as well as to [[New Netherland]]. Stuyvesant's Resolution Book shows the multi-ethnic makeup of the garrison and the use of local Indians: \"... whereas the number of Indians, together with those of Aruba and Bonnairo, have increased here by half, and we have learned that they frequently ride ...\" They communicated with each other in 'Papiamento' a language originating when the first Europeans began to arrive on these islands under Ojeda, Juan de Ampues, Bejarano and mixing with the natives. Stuyvesant also took some [[Esopus Wars|Esopus Indians]] captives in New Netherland and brought them as slaves to Cura\u00e7ao. There was little Dutch government activity in the management of DWI because during the period 1568\u20131648, they were actively fighting for their independence and were not in a position to manage their colonies.\n\nA more recent theory holds that the origins of Papiamento lie in the Afro-Portuguese creoles that arose almost a century earlier, in the west coast of Africa and in the [[Portuguese Cape Verde]] islands. From the 16th to the late 17th century, most of the slaves taken to the Caribbean came from Portuguese trading posts (\"factories\") in those regions. Around those ports several Portuguese-African pidgin and creole languages developed, such as [[Cape Verdean Creole]], [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]], [[Angolar language|Angolar]] and [[Forro language|Forro]] (from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9).<ref>{{cite book|last=Baptista|first=Marlyse|title=On the development of nominal and verbal morphology in four lusophone creoles (seminar presentation given 6 November 2009, University of Pittsburgh)|year=2009}}</ref> These sister languages bear strong resemblance with Papiamento. According to this theory, Papiamento was derived from one or more of these older creoles or their predecessors, that was brought to the ABC islands by slaves and traders from Cape Verde and West Africa. \n\nThe similarity between Papiamento and the other Afro-Portuguese creoles can be seen in the same pronouns used: \"mi\", \"bo\", \"el\", \"nos\", \"bos(o)\", these words being Portuguese based. \nIn Afro-Portuguese creoles we often see a shift from the \"v\" to \"b\" and from \"o\" to \"u\". Look at the word \"bientu\" (\"wind\") instead of \"viento\". In creole and also in Spanish, the \"v\" is pronounced as a \"b\". In creole it is also written as a \"b\". The last \"o\" changes in an \"u\", just like in Portuguese pronunciation, where the last \"o\" in a word is pronounced as an \"u\". \n\nGuene (the name comes from \"Guinea\") was a secret language, that was used by slaves on the plantations of the landhouses of West Cura\u00e7ao.<ref>Paul Brenneker - Curacaoensia (Augustinus 1961)</ref> There were about one hundred Guene songs that were sung to make the work lighter.<ref>Martinus, Efraim Frank (1996). A Kiss of the Slave: Papiamento and its West African Connections.</ref> But because of the secret character of Guene, it never had much influence on Papiamento.\n\n=== Linguistic and historical ties with Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole ===\nCurrent research on the origins of Papiamento focuses specifically on the linguistic and historical relationships between Papiamento and Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole as spoken on the Santiago island of Cape Verde and in Guinea-Bissau and Casamance. Elaborating on comparisons done by Martinus (1996) and Quint (2000),<ref>Quint, Nicolas (2000). \"Le Cap Verdien: Origines et Devenir d\u2019une Langue M\u00e9tisse\". L\u2019Harmattan, Paris.</ref> Jacobs (2008,<ref>Jacobs, Bart (2008) [https://www.academia.edu/655950/Papiamentu_a_diachronic_analysis_of_its_core_morphology \"Papiamento: A diachronic analysis of its core morphology\"] ''Phrasis'' 2, 59\u201382</ref> 2009a, 2009b<ref>Jacobs, Bart (2009b) \"The origins of Old Portuguese features in Papiamento\". In: Faraclas, Nicholas; Severing, Ronald; Weijer, Christa; Echteld, Liesbeth (eds.). \"Leeward voices: Fresh perspectives on Papiamento and the literatures and cultures of the ABC Islands\", 11\u201338. FPI/UNA, Cura\u00e7ao.</ref>) defends the hypothesis that Papiamento is a relexified offshoot of an early Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole variety, transferred from Senegambia to Cura\u00e7ao in the second half of the 17th century, a period in which the Dutch controlled the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]], a slave trading stronghold off the coast of Senegal. On Cura\u00e7ao, this variety underwent internal changes as well as contact-induced changes at all levels of the grammar (though particularly in the lexicon) due to contact with Spanish and, to a lesser extent, Dutch. These changes notwithstanding, the morpho-syntactic framework of Papiamento is still remarkably close to that of the Upper Guinea Creoles of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.\n\n=== Present status ===\nMany Papiamento speakers are [[multilingual]] and are able to speak some Dutch, [[English language|English]] and Spanish. Papiamento has been an official language of [[Aruba]] since May, 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Migge |first1=Bettina |last2=L\u00e9glise |first2=Isabelle |last3=Bartens |first3=Angela |year=2010 |title=Creoles in Education: An Appraisal of Current Programs and Projects |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |page = 268 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SMLb6hKv4YC&lpg=PT276&dq=aruba%20official%20language%20Papiamento&pg=PT276#v=onepage&q=aruba%20official%20language%20Papiamento&f=false |isbn=978-90-272-5258-6}}</ref> In the former [[Netherlands Antilles]], Papiamento was made an official language on March 7, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=&c=1478 |title=Nieuwsbrief 070313 \u2013 Papiaments officieel erkend |publisher=Nieuws.leidenuniv.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> After the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]], Papiamento's official status was confirmed in the newly formed [[Caribbean Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0028827/geldigheidsdatum_24-10-2010|title=Tijdelijke wet offici\u00eble talen BES|language=Dutch|quote=Artikel 2: De offici\u00eble talen zijn het Engels, het Nederlands en het Papiamento.

Some Papiamento is also spoken on [[Sint Maarten]] and the [[Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula]] of Venezuela.\n\n[[Venezuelan Spanish]] and [[American English]] are constant influences today. [[Code-switching]] and [[lexical borrowing]] between Papiamento, Spanish, Dutch and English among native speakers is common. This is perceived as a threat to the further development of Papiamento due to a [[language ideology]] that is committed to preserving the authentic and Creole \"feel\" of Papiamento.\n\nMany Latin American and Caribbean immigrants choose to learn Papiamento because it is more practical in daily life on the islands. For Spanish speakers, it is easier to learn than Dutch, because Papiamento has many Spanish and Portuguese words in it.<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/papiamentu.html Papiamentu, written by Tara Sanchez]</ref>\n\n==Orthography and spelling==\n{{Main|Papiamento orthography}}\n\nPapiamento is written using the [[Latin script]]. \n\nSince the 1970s, two different orthographies were developed and adopted. In 1976, Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire officially adopted the R\u00f6mer-Maduro-Jonis version, a phonetic spelling. In 1977, Aruba approved a more [[etymology|etymology-]]<nowiki/>based spelling presented by the Comision di Ortografia (Orthography Commission) presided by Jossy Mansur.\n\n== Distribution and dialects ==\n\nPapiamento has two main dialects, one in [[Languages of Aruba|Aruba]] and one in [[Cura\u00e7ao#Languages|Cura\u00e7ao]] and [[Bonaire#Languages|Bonaire]] (Papiamentu), with lexical and intonational differences.<ref>Kook, Hetty; Narain, Goretti (1993). \"Papiamento\". In: Extra, Guus; Verhoeven, Ludo (eds.), \"Community Languages in the Netherlands\" (pp. 69\u201391). Swets & Zeitlinger, Amsterdam.</ref> There are also minor differences between Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire.\n\nSpoken Aruban Papiamento sounds much more like Spanish. The most apparent difference between the two dialects is given away in the name difference. Whereas Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao opted for a phonology-based spelling, Aruba uses an etymology-based spelling. Many words in Aruba end with \"o\" while that same word ends with \"u\" in Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao. And even in Cura\u00e7ao, the use of the u-ending is still more pronounced among the Sephardic Jewish population. Similarly, there is also a difference between the usage of \"k\" in Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao and \"c\" in Aruba.\n\nFor example:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |English\n!Cura\u00e7ao and <br>Bonaire\n!Aruba\n! scope=\"col\" |Portuguese\n! scope=\"col\" |Spanish\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Stick\n|Palu\n|Palo\n|Pau\n|Palo\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |House\n|Kas\n|Cas\n|Casa\n|Casa\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Knife\n|Kuch\u00fa\n|Cuchiu\n|Faca\n|Cuchillo\n|}\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs ===\n\nPapiamento [[vowel]]s are based on Ibero-Romance vowels, as well as on Dutch vowels.

Many words have a very different meaning when a different stress is used.\n\nFor example, the word ''kome'' (\"to eat\"). \n* When both syllables are equally stressed: ''kome'', the meaning is: \"to eat\".\n* When emphasis is placed upon the first syllable: '''''ko'''me'', it means: \"eat!\" (imperative). \n* When you say: ''ko'''m'\u00e9''''' (short for ''kome \u00e9''), then the meaning is: \"eat it!\".\n\nThere are general rules for the stress and accent, but also a great many exceptions.\nWhen a word deviates from the rules, the stressed vowel should be indicated by an acute accent mark. The accent marks are often omitted in casual writing.\n\nThe main rules are<ref>Goilo, Enrique R. (2000). \"Papiamento Textbook\". De Wit Stores, Oranjestad.</ref>: \n* When a word ends in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), the stress is placed upon the '''penultimate''' (before last) syllable: ''bu'''ri'''ku'' (\"donkey\").\n* When a word ends not in a vowel, but with a consonant, the stress is placed upon the '''last''' syllable: ''hospi'''tal'''''.\n* When a verb has two syllables, the syllables are about equally stressed: ''s\u00f2ru'' (\"to care\"), ''falta'' (\"to lack\").\n* When a verb has more than two syllables, the stress is laid upon the '''last''' syllable: ''kontes'''t\u00e1''''' (\"to answer\"), ''primin'''t\u00ed''''' (\"to promise\").\n\n== Lexicon ==\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nMost of the vocabulary is derived from Portuguese and its derived Portuguese-based creoles and (Old) Spanish. Most of the time the real origin is difficult to tell due to the great similarity between the two Iberian languages and the adaptations made in Papiamento. A list of two hundred basic Papiamento words can be found in the standard Swadesh list, with etymological reference to the language of origin.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Papiamento_Swadesh_list Papiamento Swadesh list, basic word list with etymological references]</ref> There is a remarkable similarity between words in Papiamento, Cape Verdean Creole and Guinea-Bissau Creole, which all belong to the same language family of the [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Upper Guinea Creoles]]. Most of these words can be connected with their Portuguese origin. \n\nLinguistic studies have shown that roughly eighty percent of the words in Papiamento's present vocabulary are of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin, twenty percent are of Dutch origin, and some of Native American or African origin. A study by Van Buurt and Joubert inventoried the words of Ta\u00edno and Caquet\u00edo Arawak origin, mostly words for plants and animals.<ref>Van Buurt, Gerard; Joubert, Sidney M. (1997). \"Stemmen uit het Verleden, Indiaanse Woorden in het Papiamentu\". Cura\u00e7ao</ref> Arawak is an extinct language that was spoken by Indians throughout the Caribbean. The Arawak words were (re)introduced in Papiamento by borrowing from the Spanish dialect of Venezuela<ref>Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola (2010). \"Diccionario de Americanismos\". Lima</ref>\n\nMany words are of Iberian origin and it is impossible to label them as Portuguese or Spanish, like:\n* por fabor (\"please\") \u2013 Spanish: ''por favor'' - Portuguese: ''por favor'' \n* se\u00f1ora (\"madam\") \u2013 Spanish: ''se\u00f1ora'' - Portuguese: ''senhora''\n* kua (\"which\") - Spanish: ''cu\u00e1l'' - Portuguese: ''qual''\n* kuantu (\"how much\") \u2013 Spanish: ''cu\u00e1nto'' - Portuguese: ''quanto''.\n\nWhile the presence of word-final {{IPA|/u/}} can easily be traced to Portuguese, the [[diphthong]]ization of some vowels is characteristic of Spanish. The use of {{IPA|/b/}} (rather than {{IPA|/v/}}) descends from its pronunciation in the dialects of northern Portugal, and [[Spanish phonology|Spanish]]. Also, a sound-shift can have occurred in the direction of Spanish, whose influence on Papiamento came later than that of Portuguese. \nFor instance: ''subrino'' (\"nephew\"): ''sobrinho'' in Portuguese, ''sobrino'' in Spanish. The pronunciation of ''o'' as {{IPA|/u/}} is traceable to Portuguese, while the use of ''n'' instead of ''nh'' (IPA {{IPA|/\u0272/}}) in the ending ''-no'' relates to Spanish.\n\nThe Portuguese words mostly don't descend directly from the Portuguese, but come via the Portuguese-based Creole; in the examples below, the Cape Verdean Creole equivalents are: ''borbol\u00e9ta'', ''katchor'', ''pr\u00e9tu'' and ''f\u00f3rsa''. \n\nPortuguese-origin words:\n* barbul\u00e8t\u00e8 (\"butterfly\") \u2013 Portuguese: ''borboleta''.\n* kach\u00f3\t(\"dog\") \u2013 Portuguese: ''cachorro''.\n* pretu\t(\"black\") \u2013 Portuguese: ''preto''. \n* forsa (\"power\") - Portuguese: ''for\u00e7a''.\n\nSpanish-origin words:\n* siudat (\"city\") \u2013 Spanish: ''ciudad''\n* sombr\u00e9 (\"hat\") \u2013 Spanish: ''sombrero''\n* karson (\"trousers\") \u2013 Spanish: ''calz\u00f3n''\n* h\u00f2mber (\"man\") \u2013 Spanish: ''hombre''.\n\nDutch-origin words:\n* apel (\"apple\") \u2013 Dutch: ''appel''\n* buki (\"book\") \u2013 Dutch: ''boek''\n* lesa (\"to read\") \u2013 Dutch: ''lezen''\n* mart (\"March\") - Dutch: ''maart''.\n\n'''And some words come from:'''\n\nEnglish-origin words:\n* b\u00e8k - English: ''back''\n* b\u00f2ter - English: ''bottle''\n* baiskel - English: ''bicycle''.\n\nAfrican-origin words:\n* pinda (\"peanut\") - Kongo: ''mpinda'' \n* makamba (\"white man\") - Bantu: ''ma-kamba''\n* yongot\u00e1 (\"to kneel\") - Wolof: ''djongot\u00f3''\n* maribomba (\"wasp\") - Bantu: ''ma-rimbondo''.\n\nNative American-origin words:\n* orkan (\"hurricane\") \u2013 Ta\u00edno: ''jurac\u00e1n''\n* maishi (\"corn\") \u2013 Ta\u00edno: ''mah\u00edz''\n* kunuku (\"farm\") \u2013 Ta\u00edno: ''conuco''\n* mahos (\"ugly\") - Arawak: ''muhusu''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Phrase samples ===\n* Kon ta bai?

Jacoba Bouschoute made a study of the many Dutch influences in Papiamento.<ref>Bouschoute, Jacoba (1969). [https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094428 \"Certain Aspects Of The Dutch Influence On Papiamentu\"]. University of British Columbia.</ref>.\n\nThe name of the language itself comes from ''papia'' or ''papear'' (\"to chat\", \"to talk\"), a word present in Portuguese and colloquial Spanish. \n\nSpain claimed dominion over the islands in the 15th century, but made little use of them after the Spanish defeat to the Netherlands as a result of [[Eighty Years' War]]. Portuguese merchants had been trading extensively in the West Indies, and with the Iberian Union, this trade extended to the Castillian West Indies, as the Spanish kings favoured the free movement of people. In 1634, the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC) took possession of the islands, deporting most of the small remaining [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] and Spanish population to the continent, and turned them into the hub of the Dutch slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean.\n\nThe first evidence of widespread use of Papiamento in Aruba can be seen through the Cura\u00e7ao official documents in the early 18th century. In the 19th century, most materials in the islands were written in Papiamento including [[Roman Catholic]] schoolbooks and hymnals. The first Papiamento newspaper was published in 1871 and was titled ''Civilisad\u00f3'' (The Civilizer). \n\nA summary of the debate on Papiamento's origins is provided in Bart Jacobs' study ''The Upper Guinea Origins of Papiamento''.<ref>Jacobs, Bart (2009a) [https://www.academia.edu/621021/The_Upper_Guinea_origins_of_Papiamentu_Linguistic_and_historical_evidence \"The Upper Guinea Origins of Papiamento: Linguistic and Historical Evidence\"]. ''Diachronica'' 26:3, 319\u2013379</ref>\nAn outline of the competing theories is provided below.\n\n=== Local development theory ===\nThere are various local development theories. One such theory proposes that Papiamento developed in the Caribbean from an original Portuguese-African [[pidgin]] used for communication between African slaves and Portuguese slave traders, with later Dutch and Spanish (and even some Arawak) influences. \n\nAnother theory is that Papiamento first evolved from the use in this region since 1499 of 'lenguas' and the first Repopulation of the ABC islands by the Spanish by the C\u00e9dula real decreed in November 1525, in which Juan Martinez de Ampu\u00e9s, factor of Espa\u00f1ola, had been granted the right to repopulate the depopulated Islas in\u00fatiles of Oroba, Islas de los Gigantes and Buon Aire. \nThe evolution of Papiamento continued under the Dutch colonisation under the influence of the 16th century Dutch, Portuguese (Brazilian) and Native American languages (Arawak en Ta\u00edno) with the second repopulation of these ABC islands under [[Peter Stuyvesant]], who arrived here from the ex-Dutch Brazilian colonies.\n\nThe Judaeo-Portuguese population of the ABC islands increased substantially after 1654, when the Portuguese recovered the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch-held territories in Northeast]] [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]{{spaced ndash}}causing most of the Portuguese-speaking Jews and their Portuguese-speaking Dutch allies and Dutch-speaking Portuguese Brazilian allies in those lands to flee from religious persecution. \nThe precise role of [[Sephardic Jew]]s in the early development is unclear, but it is certain that [[Jew]]s played a prominent role in the later development of Papiamento. Many early residents of Cura\u00e7ao were Sephardic Jews either from Portugal, Spain, Cape Verde or Portuguese Brazil. Also, after the [[Eighty Years' War]], a group of Sephardic Jews immigrated from Amsterdam. Therefore, it can be assumed that [[Judaeo-Portuguese]] was brought to the island of Cura\u00e7ao, where it gradually spread to other parts of the community. As the Jewish community became the prime merchants and traders in the area, business and everyday trading was conducted in Papiamento. While various nations owned the island and official languages changed with ownership, Papiamento became the constant language of the residents. When Netherlands opened economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia in the 18th century<ref name=Putte>[https://www.academia.edu/35221185/_Florimon_van_Putte_Dede_piki%C3%B1a_ku_su_bisi%C3%B1a_Papiamentu_Nederlands_en_de_onverwerkt_verleden_tijd._Zutphen_1999 Dede piki\u00f1a ku su bisi\u00f1a: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd.] van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers</ref> the students on Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish, and Spanish began to influence the creole language.<ref name=papia/> \nSince there was a continuous Latinisation process (Hoetink, 1987), even the elite Dutch-Protestant settlers eventually communicated better in Spanish than in Dutch. A wealth of local Spanish-language publications in the nineteenth century testify to this.\n\n=== European and African origin theory ===\nPeter Stuyvesant's appointment to the ABC islands followed his service in Brazil. He brought Indians, soldiers, etc. from Brazil to Cura\u00e7ao as well as to [[New Netherland]]. Stuyvesant's Resolution Book shows the multi-ethnic makeup of the garrison and the use of local Indians: \"... whereas the number of Indians, together with those of Aruba and Bonnairo, have increased here by half, and we have learned that they frequently ride ...\" They communicated with each other in 'Papiamento' a language originating when the first Europeans began to arrive on these islands under Ojeda, Juan de Ampues, Bejarano and mixing with the natives. Stuyvesant also took some [[Esopus Wars|Esopus Indians]] captives in New Netherland and brought them as slaves to Cura\u00e7ao. There was little Dutch government activity in the management of DWI because during the period 1568\u20131648, they were actively fighting for their independence and were not in a position to manage their colonies.\n\nA more recent theory holds that the origins of Papiamento lie in the Afro-Portuguese creoles that arose almost a century earlier, in the west coast of Africa and in the [[Portuguese Cape Verde]] islands. From the 16th to the late 17th century, most of the slaves taken to the Caribbean came from Portuguese trading posts (\"factories\") in those regions. Around those ports several Portuguese-African pidgin and creole languages developed, such as [[Cape Verdean Creole]], [[Guinea-Bissau Creole]], [[Angolar language|Angolar]] and [[Forro language|Forro]] (from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9).<ref>{{cite book|last=Baptista|first=Marlyse|title=On the development of nominal and verbal morphology in four lusophone creoles (seminar presentation given 6 November 2009, University of Pittsburgh)|year=2009}}</ref> These sister languages bear strong resemblance with Papiamento. According to this theory, Papiamento was derived from one or more of these older creoles or their predecessors, that was brought to the ABC islands by slaves and traders from Cape Verde and West Africa. \n\nThe similarity between Papiamento and the other Afro-Portuguese creoles can be seen in the same pronouns used: \"mi\", \"bo\", \"el\", \"nos\", \"bos(o)\", these words being Portuguese based. \nIn Afro-Portuguese creoles we often see a shift from the \"v\" to \"b\" and from \"o\" to \"u\". Look at the word \"bientu\" (\"wind\") instead of \"viento\". In creole and also in Spanish, the \"v\" is pronounced as a \"b\". In creole it is also written as a \"b\". The last \"o\" changes in an \"u\", just like in Portuguese pronunciation, where the last \"o\" in a word is pronounced as an \"u\". \n\nGuene (the name comes from \"Guinea\") was a secret language, that was used by slaves on the plantations of the landhouses of West Cura\u00e7ao.<ref>Paul Brenneker - Curacaoensia (Augustinus 1961)</ref> There were about one hundred Guene songs that were sung to make the work lighter.<ref>Martinus, Efraim Frank (1996). A Kiss of the Slave: Papiamento and its West African Connections.</ref> But because of the secret character of Guene, it never had much influence on Papiamento.\n\n=== Linguistic and historical ties with Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole ===\nCurrent research on the origins of Papiamento focuses specifically on the linguistic and historical relationships between Papiamento and Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole as spoken on the Santiago island of Cape Verde and in Guinea-Bissau and Casamance. Elaborating on comparisons done by Martinus (1996) and Quint (2000),<ref>Quint, Nicolas (2000). \"Le Cap Verdien: Origines et Devenir d\u2019une Langue M\u00e9tisse\".

FPI/UNA, Cura\u00e7ao.</ref>) defends the hypothesis that Papiamento is a relexified offshoot of an early Upper Guinea Portuguese Creole variety, transferred from Senegambia to Cura\u00e7ao in the second half of the 17th century, a period in which the Dutch controlled the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]], a slave trading stronghold off the coast of Senegal. On Cura\u00e7ao, this variety underwent internal changes as well as contact-induced changes at all levels of the grammar (though particularly in the lexicon) due to contact with Spanish and, to a lesser extent, Dutch. These changes notwithstanding, the morpho-syntactic framework of Papiamento is still remarkably close to that of the Upper Guinea Creoles of Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.\n\n=== Present status ===\nMany Papiamento speakers are [[multilingual]] and are able to speak some Dutch, [[English language|English]] and Spanish. Papiamento has been an official language of [[Aruba]] since May, 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Migge |first1=Bettina |last2=L\u00e9glise |first2=Isabelle |last3=Bartens |first3=Angela |year=2010 |title=Creoles in Education: An Appraisal of Current Programs and Projects |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |page = 268 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SMLb6hKv4YC&lpg=PT276&dq=aruba%20official%20language%20Papiamento&pg=PT276#v=onepage&q=aruba%20official%20language%20Papiamento&f=false |isbn=978-90-272-5258-6}}</ref> In the former [[Netherlands Antilles]], Papiamento was made an official language on March 7, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=&c=1478 |title=Nieuwsbrief 070313 \u2013 Papiaments officieel erkend |publisher=Nieuws.leidenuniv.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> After [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|the Netherland Antilles' dissolution]], Papiamento's official status was confirmed in the newly formed [[Caribbean Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0028827/geldigheidsdatum_24-10-2010|title=Tijdelijke wet offici\u00eble talen BES|language=Dutch|quote=Artikel 2: De offici\u00eble talen zijn het Engels, het Nederlands en het Papiamento.

Some Papiamento is also spoken on [[Sint Maarten]] and the [[Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula]] of Venezuela. \n\n[[Venezuelan Spanish]] and [[American English]] are constant influences today. [[Code-switching]] and [[lexical borrowing]] between Papiamento, Spanish, Dutch and English among native speakers is common. This is perceived as a threat to the further development of Papiamento due to a [[language ideology]] that is committed to preserving the authentic and Creole \"feel\" of Papiamento.\n\nMany Latin American and Caribbean immigrants choose to learn Papiamento because it is more practical in daily life on the islands. For Spanish speakers, it is easier to learn than Dutch, because Papiamento has many Spanish and Portuguese words in it.<ref>[http://www.hawaii.edu/satocenter/langnet/definitions/papiamentu.html Papiamentu, written by Tara Sanchez]</ref>\n\n==Orthography and spelling==\n{{Main|Papiamento orthography}}\n\nPapiamento is written using the [[Latin script]]. \n\nSince the 1970s, two different orthographies were developed and adopted. In 1976, Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire officially adopted the R\u00f6mer-Maduro-Jonis version, a phonetic spelling. In 1977, Aruba approved a more [[etymology|etymology-]]<nowiki/>based spelling presented by the Comision di Ortografia (Orthography Commission) presided by Jossy Mansur.\n\n== Distribution and dialects ==\n\nPapiamento has two main dialects, one in [[Languages of Aruba|Aruba]] and one in [[Cura\u00e7ao#Languages|Cura\u00e7ao]] and [[Bonaire#Languages|Bonaire]] (Papiamentu), with lexical and intonational differences.<ref>Kook, Hetty; Narain, Goretti (1993). \"Papiamento\". In: Extra, Guus; Verhoeven, Ludo (eds.), \"Community Languages in the Netherlands\" (pp. 69\u201391). Swets & Zeitlinger, Amsterdam.</ref> There are also minor differences between Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire.\n\nSpoken Aruban Papiamento sounds much more like Spanish. The most apparent difference between the two dialects is given away in the name difference. Whereas Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao opted for a phonology-based spelling, Aruba uses an etymology-based spelling. Many words in Aruba end with \"o\" while that same word ends with \"u\" in Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao. And even in Cura\u00e7ao, the use of the u-ending is still more pronounced among the Sephardic Jewish population. Similarly, there is also a difference between the usage of \"k\" in Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao and \"c\" in Aruba.\n\nFor example:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |English\n!Cura\u00e7ao and <br>Bonaire\n!Aruba\n! scope=\"col\" |Portuguese\n! scope=\"col\" |Spanish\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Stick\n|Palu\n|Palo\n|Pau\n|Palo\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |House\n|Kas\n|Cas\n|Casa\n|Casa\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Knife\n|Kuch\u00fa\n|Cuchiu\n|Faca\n|Cuchillo\n|}\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs ===\n\nPapiamento [[vowel]]s are based on Ibero-Romance vowels, as well as on Dutch vowels. Papiamento has the following nine vowels.<ref>Maurer, Philippe (1990). \"Die Verschriftung des Papiamento\". In \"Zum Stand der Kodifizierung romanischer Kleinsprachen\".

Many words have a very different meaning when a different stress is used.\n\nFor example, the word ''kome'' (\"to eat\"). \n* When both syllables are equally stressed: ''kome'', the meaning is: \"to eat\".\n* When emphasis is placed upon the first syllable: '''''ko'''me'', it means: \"eat!\" (imperative). \n* When you say: ''ko'''m'\u00e9''''' (short for ''kome \u00e9''), then the meaning is: \"eat it!\".\n\nThere are general rules for the stress and accent, but also a great many exceptions.\nWhen a word deviates from the rules, the stressed vowel should be indicated by an acute accent mark. The accent marks are often omitted in casual writing.\n\nThe main rules are<ref>Goilo, Enrique R. (2000). \"Papiamento Textbook\". De Wit Stores, Oranjestad.</ref>: \n* When a word ends in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), the stress is placed upon the '''penultimate''' (before last) syllable: ''bu'''ri'''ku'' (\"donkey\").\n* When a word ends not in a vowel, but with a consonant, the stress is placed upon the '''last''' syllable: ''hospi'''tal'''''.\n* When a verb has two syllables, the syllables are about equally stressed: ''s\u00f2ru'' (\"to care\"), ''falta'' (\"to lack\").\n* When a verb has more than two syllables, the stress is laid upon the '''last''' syllable: ''kontes'''t\u00e1''''' (\"to answer\"), ''primin'''t\u00ed''''' (\"to promise\").\n\n== Lexicon ==\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nMost of the vocabulary is derived from Portuguese and its derived Portuguese-based creoles and (Old) Spanish. Most of the time the real origin is difficult to tell due to the great similarity between the two Iberian languages and the adaptations made in Papiamento. A list of two hundred basic Papiamento words can be found in the standard Swadesh list, with etymological reference to the language of origin.<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Papiamento_Swadesh_list Papiamento Swadesh list, basic word list with etymological references]</ref> There is a remarkable similarity between words in Papiamento, Cape Verdean Creole and Guinea-Bissau Creole, which all belong to the same language family of the [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Upper Guinea Creoles]]. Most of these words can be connected with their Portuguese origin. \n\nLinguistic studies have shown that roughly eighty percent of the words in Papiamento's present vocabulary are of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin, twenty percent are of Dutch origin, and some of Native American or African origin. A study by Van Buurt and Joubert inventoried the words of Ta\u00edno and Caquet\u00edo Arawak origin, mostly words for plants and animals.<ref>Van Buurt, Gerard; Joubert, Sidney M. (1997). \"Stemmen uit het Verleden, Indiaanse Woorden in het Papiamentu\". Cura\u00e7ao</ref> Arawak is an extinct language that was spoken by Indians throughout the Caribbean. The Arawak words were (re)introduced in Papiamento by borrowing from the Spanish dialect of Venezuela<ref>Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola (2010). \"Diccionario de Americanismos\". Lima</ref>\n\nMany words are of Iberian origin and it is impossible to label them as Portuguese or Spanish, like:\n* por fabor (\"please\") \u2013 Spanish: ''por favor'' - Portuguese: ''por favor'' \n* se\u00f1ora (\"madam\") \u2013 Spanish: ''se\u00f1ora'' - Portuguese: ''senhora''\n* kua (\"which\") - Spanish: ''cu\u00e1l'' - Portuguese: ''qual''\n* kuantu (\"how much\") \u2013 Spanish: ''cu\u00e1nto'' - Portuguese: ''quanto''.\n\nWhile the presence of word-final {{IPA|/u/}} can easily be traced to Portuguese, the [[diphthong]]ization of some vowels is characteristic of Spanish. The use of {{IPA|/b/}} (rather than {{IPA|/v/}}) descends from its pronunciation in the dialects of northern Portugal, and [[Spanish phonology|Spanish]]. Also, a sound-shift can have occurred in the direction of Spanish, whose influence on Papiamento came later than that of Portuguese. \nFor instance: ''subrino'' (\"nephew\"): ''sobrinho'' in Portuguese, ''sobrino'' in Spanish. The pronunciation of ''o'' as {{IPA|/u/}} is traceable to Portuguese, while the use of ''n'' instead of ''nh'' (IPA {{IPA|/\u0272/}}) in the ending ''-no'' relates to Spanish.\n\nThe Portuguese words mostly don't descend directly from the Portuguese, but come via the Portuguese-based Creole; in the examples below, the Cape Verdean Creole equivalents are: ''borbol\u00e9ta'', ''katchor'', ''pr\u00e9tu'' and ''f\u00f3rsa''. \n\nPortuguese-origin words:\n* barbul\u00e8t\u00e8 (\"butterfly\") \u2013 Portuguese: ''borboleta''.\n* kach\u00f3\t(\"dog\") \u2013 Portuguese: ''cachorro''.\n* pretu\t(\"black\") \u2013 Portuguese: ''preto''. \n* forsa (\"power\") - Portuguese: ''for\u00e7a''.\n\nSpanish-origin words:\n* siudat (\"city\") \u2013 Spanish: ''ciudad''\n* sombr\u00e9 (\"hat\") \u2013 Spanish: ''sombrero''\n* karson (\"trousers\") \u2013 Spanish: ''calz\u00f3n''\n* h\u00f2mber (\"man\") \u2013 Spanish: ''hombre''.\n\nDutch-origin words:\n* apel (\"apple\") \u2013 Dutch: ''appel''\n* buki (\"book\") \u2013 Dutch: ''boek''\n* lesa (\"to read\") \u2013 Dutch: ''lezen''\n* mart (\"March\") - Dutch: ''maart''.\n\n'''And some words come from:'''\n\nEnglish-origin words:\n* b\u00e8k - English: ''back''\n* b\u00f2ter - English: ''bottle''\n* baiskel - English: ''bicycle''.\n\nAfrican-origin words:\n* pinda (\"peanut\") - Kongo: ''mpinda'' \n* makamba (\"white man\") - Bantu: ''ma-kamba''\n* yongot\u00e1 (\"to kneel\") - Wolof: ''djongot\u00f3''\n* maribomba (\"wasp\") - Bantu: ''ma-rimbondo''.\n\nNative American-origin words:\n* orkan (\"hurricane\") \u2013 Ta\u00edno: ''jurac\u00e1n''\n* maishi (\"corn\") \u2013 Ta\u00edno: ''mah\u00edz''\n* kunuku (\"farm\") \u2013 Ta\u00edno: ''conuco''\n* mahos (\"ugly\") - Arawak: ''muhusu''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Phrase samples ===\n* Kon ta bai?

Built by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] in 1986 to replace the aging ''Karhu''-class icebreakers, she was the first Finnish post-war icebreaker to be built without bow propellers. ''Otso'' has an identical sister ship, [[Kontio (icebreaker)|''Kontio'']], which was delivered in 1987.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the early 1980s, the [[Finnish National Board of Navigation]] began looking for a replacement for the aging ''Karhu''-class icebreakers [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu|''Karhu'']], [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Sampo (1960 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] which had been built in the late 1950s and were no longer wide enough to escort modern merchant ships.<ref name=\"sws\">Karhu II - A new-generation icebreaker.

The tenth post-war icebreaker of Finland was ordered from [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] on 19 March 1984 with a price of [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 235 million.<ref name=\"sws\" /><ref>Uusi murtaja tilattu.

In January 1987, ''Otso'' was followed by a similarly-named sister ship, ''Kontio'', after which the three ''Karhu''-class icebreakers were decommissioned and sold.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" />\n\nDuring extensive ice trials in the [[Bothnian Bay]] in March 1986, ''Otso'' was put through a series of test to determine her icebreaking capability.

However, the strength of the new icebreaker was put to the ultimate test when she encountered a large pressure ridge reaching all the way to the seafloor some {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} below the surface. After preparations, ''Otso'' was accelerated to a speed of {{convert|14|kn}} and rammed into the ridge at full power. Since the new icebreaker had a smooth inclined [[Stem (ship)|stem]] and lacked the bow propellers of her predecessors, she rode up the ridge and began listing to the port side as the hull rose from the water.

The tenth post-war icebreaker of Finland was ordered from [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] on 19 March 1984 with a price of [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 235 million.<ref name=\"sws\" /><ref>Uusi murtaja tilattu.

Close towing, in which the escorted ship is pulled to the towing notch of the icebreaker, is commonly used for smaller vessels.]]\nBefore ''Otso'' entered service in 1986, the Finnish icebreaker captains were sceptical about the ability of an icebreaker without bow propellers to operate successfully in the shallow Finnish waters characterized by heavy ice ridges. However, after the early [[teething problem]]s and successful ice trials, the opinions changed and the performance of the \"Bubbler of the Bothnian Bay\" was generally deemed to be satisfactory.<ref name=\"smk4-86\" /> Over the years, ''Otso'' and her sister ship ''Kontio'' have proved to be very cost-efficient and for that reason they are the first Finnish state-owned icebreakers to be deployed for icebreaking in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] every winter.<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\nUntil 2015, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' were the last Finnish icebreakers designed solely for escorting merchant ships through ice-infested waters.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" /> In the 1990s, the Finnish Maritime Administration commissioned three multipurpose icebreakers with a secondary role in [[Offshore drilling|offshore]] construction projects during the summer months. However, due to the criticism of the multipurpose icebreakers and Arctic offshore drilling in general, [[Polaris (icebreaker)|the new icebreaker]] that will replace the aging [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] in 2015 will be a traditional one.<ref>[http://www.lvm.fi/web/fi/tiedote/-/view/4118574 Liikenne- ja viestint\u00e4ministeri\u00f6n budjettiehdotus 2,9 miljardia euroa].

The vessel will be upgraded for service in the northern latitudes by increasing her ice strengthening, now adequate for icebreaking in the Baltic Sea, to ''[[Polar Class 4]]'' (PC 4) which is intended for vessels operating year-round in thick first-year ice which may include old ice inclusions. Furthermore, a {{convert|250|m3|cuft|adj=on}} anti-rolling tank will be installed to improve her open water characteristics. Other additions include lifeboats to allow unrestricted worldwide service as well as a new helideck. The modifications, scheduled to be completed by July 2015, will be carried out by [[Rauma Marine Constructions]]. After the summer season in the Arctic, ''Otso'' will return to the Baltic Sea icebreaking duty by November as mandated by the icebreaking contract between Arctia Shipping and the Finnish Transport Agency.<ref>[http://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/otson-kylkiin-terasta-kannelle-helikopterikentta-ja-vesiallas-miehistolle-arktiset-palkanlisat-3474552 Otson kylkiin ter\u00e4st\u00e4, kannelle helikopterikentt\u00e4 ja vesiallas \u2013 miehist\u00f6lle arktiset palkanlis\u00e4t].

He ruled [[Sapadalaksha]], the traditional Chahamana territory, in present-day north-western India. He controlled much of the present-day [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], and [[Delhi]]; and some parts of [[Punjab]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. His capital was located at Ajayameru (modern [[Ajmer]]), although the medieval folk legends describe him as the king of India's political centre Delhi to portray him as a representative of the pre-Islamic Indian power.\n\nEarly in his career, Prithviraj achieved military successes against several neighbouring Hindu kingdoms, most notably against the [[Chandelas of Jejakabhukti|Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]]. He also repulsed the early invasions by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], a ruler of the Muslim [[Ghurid]] dynasty. However, in 1192 CE, the Ghurids defeated Prithviraj at the [[Second battle of Tarain]], and executed him shortly after. His defeat at Tarain is seen as a landmark event in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]], and has been described in several semi-legendary accounts. The most popular of these accounts is ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', which presents him as a \"[[Rajput]]\",he was rajput king..\n\n== Sources of information ==\n\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number, and were not issued by the king himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=38}} Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles. Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval ''[[k\u0101vya|kavya]]''s (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors. These include ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'', ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' and ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]''. These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=37}} ''Prithviraj Raso'', which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by the king's court poet [[Chand Bardai]]. However, it is full of exaggerated accounts many of which are worthless for the purposes of history.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nOther chronicles and texts that mention Prithviraj include ''[[Prabandha-Chintamani]]'', ''[[Prabandha Kosha]]'' and ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]''. These were composed centuries after his death, and contain exaggerations and [[anachronistic]] anecdotes.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Prithviraj has also been mentioned in ''[[Kharatara Gaccha|Kharatara-Gachchha]]-[[Pattavali]]'', a Sanskrit text containing biographies of the Kharatara [[Jainism|Jain]] monks. While the work was completed in 1336 CE, the part that mentions Prithviraj was written around 1250 CE.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} The ''[[Alha-Khand]]a'' (or ''Alha Raso'') of the [[Chandela]] poet Jaganika also provides an exaggerated account of Prithviraj's war against the Chandelas.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}\n\nSome other Indian texts also mention Prithviraj, but do not provide much information of historical value. For example, the Sanskrit poem anthology ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' (1363) contains a verse praising him, and the ''[[Kanhadade Prabandha]]'' (1455) mentions him as an earlier incarnation of the [[Chahamanas of Jalor|Jalore Chahamana]] king [[Viramadeva|Viramade]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=50}}\n\n== Early life ==\nPrithviraj was born to the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] king [[Someshvara (Chahamana dynasty)|Someshvara]] and queen Karpuradevi (a [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] princess).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} Both Prithviraj and his younger brother [[Hariraja]] were born in [[Gujarat]], where their father Someshvara was brought up at the [[Chaulukya]] court by his maternal relatives.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the [[Jyeshtha (month)|Jyeshtha month]]. The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the [[horoscope|astrological planetary positions]] at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious. Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, [[Dasharatha Sharma]] calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=18}}\n\nThe medieval biographies of Prithviraj suggest that he was educated well. The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he mastered 6 languages; the ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that he learned 14 languages, which appears to be an exaggeration. The ''Raso'' goes on to claim that he became well-versed in a number of subjects, including history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy ([[mimamsa]]), and theology. Both the texts state that he was particularly proficient in [[archery]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=161}}\n\n== Early reign ==\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of [[Prithviraja II]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=156}} Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old. The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year. Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the [[regent]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then [[Vanaprastha|retired to the forest]]. However, this is doubtful.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nDuring his early years as the king, Prithviraj's mother managed the administration, assisted by a regency council.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nKadambavasa served as the chief minister of the kingdom during this period. He is also known as Kaimasa, Kaimash or Kaimbasa in the folk legends, which describe him as an able administrator and soldier devoted to the young king.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he was responsible for all the military victories during the early years of Prithviraj's reign. According to two different legends, Kadambavasa was later killed by Prithviraj. The ''Prithviraja-Raso'' claims that Prithviraj killed the minister after finding him in the apartment of the king's favourite concubine Karnati. ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' claims that a man named Pratapa-Simha conspired against the minister, and convinced Prithviraj that the minister was responsible for the repeated Muslim invasions. Both these claims appear to be historically inaccurate, as the much more historically reliable ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' does not mention any such incident.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nBhuvanaikamalla, the paternal uncle of Prithviraj's mother, was another important minister during this time.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', he was a valiant general who served Prithviraj as [[Garuda]] serves [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=163}} The text also states that he was \"proficient in the art of subduing ''n\u0101ga''s\". According to the 15th-century historian [[Jonaraja]], \"naga\" here refers to elephants. However, [[Har Bilas Sarda]] interpreted Naga as the name of a tribe, and theorized that Bhuvanaikamalla defeated this tribe.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Prithviraj assumed actual control of the administration in 1180 CE (1237 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\n== Conflicts with Hindu rulers ==\n\n=== Nagarjuna ===\n\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Gu\u1e0dapura; possibly modern [[Gurgaon]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]], and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Nagarjuna rebelled against Prithviraj's authority and occupied the fort of Gudapura.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=164}} Prithviraj besieged Gudapura with a large army comprising [[infantry]], [[camel cavalry|camels]], [[war elephant|elephants]] and [[horse cavalry|horses]]. Nagarjuna fled the fort, but Devabhata (possibly his general) continued to offer resistance. Ultimately, Prithviraj's army emerged victorious, and captured the wife, mother, and followers of Nagarjuna. According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', a garland made of the defeated soldiers' heads was hung across the Ajmer fort gate.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Bhadanakas ===\n\nTwo verses of ''Kharatara-Gachchha-[[Pattavali]]'' mention the victory of Prithviraj over the Bhadanakas, while describing a debate between two [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]. This victory can be dated to sometime before 1182 CE, when the said debate took place.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nAccording to Cynthia Talbot, the Bhadanakas were an obscure dynasty who controlled the area around [[Bayana]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} According to Dasharatha Sharma, the Bhadanaka territory comprised the area around present-day [[Bhiwani district|Bhiwani]], [[Rewari district|Rewari]] and [[Alwar district|Alwar]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Chandelas of Jejakabhukti ===\n\nThe 1182\u201383 CE (1239 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day [[Bundelkhand]]), which was ruled by the [[Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}} Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as ''Prithviraj Raso'', ''Paramal Raso'', and ''[[Alha-Khand|Alha-Raso]]''.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=47}} Other texts such as ''Sarangadhara Paddhati'' and ''Prabandha Chintamani'' also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=168}} The ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a ''digvijaya'' (conquest of all the regions). This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nThe legendary account of Prithviraj's campaign against the Chandelas goes like this: Prithviraj was returning to [[Delhi]] after marrying the daughter of Padamsen, when his contingent was attacked by the \"Turkic\" forces ([[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]]). His army repulsed the attacks, but suffered serious casualties in the process. Amid this chaos, the Chahamana soldiers lost their way, and unknowingly encamped in the Chandela capital [[Mahoba]]. They killed the Chandela royal gardener for objecting to their presence, which led to a skirmish between the two sides. The Chandela king Paramardi asked his general [[Udal of Mahoba|Udal]] to attack Prithviraj's camp, but Udal advised against this move. Paramardi's brother-in-law Mahil Parihar ruled modern-day [[Orai]]; he harboured ill-will against Paramardi, and instigated the king to go ahead with the attack. Prithviraj defeated Udal's contingent, and then left for Delhi. Subsequently, unhappy with Mahil's scheming, Udal and his brother [[Alha]] left the Chandela court. They started serving [[Jaichand]], the [[Gahadavala]] ruler of [[Kannauj]]. Mahil then secretly informed Prithviraj that Chandela kingdom had become weak in absence of its strongest generals. Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom, and besieged Sirsagarh, which was held by Udal's cousin Malkhan. After failing to win over Malkhan through peaceful methods and losing eight generals, Prithviraj captured the fort. The Chandelas then appealed for a truce, and used this time to recall Alha and Udal from Kannauj. In support of the Chandelas, Jaichand dispatched an army led by his best generals, including two of his own sons. The combined Chandela-Gahadavala army attacked Prithviraj's camp, but was defeated. After his victory, Prithviraj sacked Mahoba. He then dispatched his general Chavand Rai to [[Kalinjar Fort]] to capture Paramardi. According to the various legends, Paramardi either died or retired shortly after the attack. Prithviraj returned to Delhi after appointing Pajjun Rai as the governor of Mahoba. Later, Paramardi's son recaptured Mahoba.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=120\u201325}}\n\nThe exact historicity of this legendary narrative is debatable. The Madanpur inscriptions establish that Prithviraj sacked Mahoba, but historical evidence indicates that he did not occupy Mahoba or Kalinjar. It is known that Paramardi did not die or retire immediately after the Chauhan victory; in fact, he continued ruling as a sovereign nearly a decade after Prithviraj's death.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=124\u201326}} It appears that Prithviraj only raided Jejakabhukti, and Paramardi regained control of his kingdom soon after his departure from Mahoba. Prithviraj was not able to annex the Chandela territory to his kingdom.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}}\n\n=== Chaulukyas of Gujarat ===\n\nThe ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and [[Bhima II]], the [[Chaulukya]] (Solanki) king of [[Gujarat]]. This implies that the two kings were previously at war.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]). The [[Veraval]] inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=75}} Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=55}}\n\nThe historically unreliable ''Prithviraj Raso'' provides some details about the Chahamana-Chaulukya struggle.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}} According to it, both Prithviraj and Bhima wanted to marry Ichchhini, the Paramara princess of Abu. Prithviraj's marriage to her led to a rivalry between the two kings. Historian [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|G. H. Ojha]] dismisses this legend as fiction, because it states that Ichchhini was a daughter of Salakha, while Dharavarsha was the Paramara ruler of Abu at the time. Historian R. B. Singh, on the other hand, believes that Salakha was the head of another Paramara branch at Abu.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=170}} The ''Raso'' also mentions that Prithviraj's uncle Kanhadeva had killed seven sons of Bhima's uncle Sarangadeva. To avenge these murders, Bhima invaded the Chahamana kingdom and killed Prithviraj's father Someshvara, capturing [[Nagor]] in the process.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=171}} Prithviraj re-captured Nagor, and defeated and killed Bhima. This is known to be historically false, as the reign of Bhima II lasted nearly half a century after Prithviraj's death. Similarly, historical evidence suggests Bhima II was a child at the time of Someshvara's death, and therefore, could not have killed him.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\nDespite these discrepancies, there is some evidence of a battle between the Chahamanas and the Chaulukyas at Nagor. Two inscriptions found at Charlu village near [[Bikaner]] commemorate the death of [[Mohil]] soldiers at the battle of Nagor in 1184 CE (1241 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]). The Mohils are a branch of the Chauhans (the Chahamanas), and it is possible the inscriptions refer to the battle described in ''Prithviraj Raso''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=76\u201377}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=172\u201373}}\n\nSometime before 1187 CE, Jagaddeva Pratihara signed a peace treaty with Prithviraj. According to ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'', a chief named Abhayada once sought Jagaddeva's permission to attack and rob the wealthy visitors from Sapadalaksha country (the Chahamana territory). In response, Jagaddeva told Abhayada that he had concluded a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty. Jaggadeva then threatened to have Abhayada sewn in a donkey's belly if he harassed the people of Sapadalaksha. Historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]] theorizes that the Chahamana-Chaulukya conflict ended with some advantage for Prithviraj, as Jagaddeva appears to have been very anxious to preserve the treaty.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Paramaras of Abu ===\n\n[[Mount Abu|Abu]] was ruled by the Chaulukya feudatory Dharavarsha, who belonged to a branch of the [[Paramara dynasty]]. ''Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga'' by his younger brother Prahaladana describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu. This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas. It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Gahadavalas of Kannauj ===\n\nThe [[Gahadavala]] kingdom, centered around [[Kannauj]] and headed by another powerful king [[Jaichand|Jayachandra]], was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom. According to a legend mentioned in ''Prithviraj Raso'', Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter [[Samyogita]], leading to a rivalry between the two kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nThe legend goes like this: King Jaichand (Jayachandra) of Kannauj decided to conduct a [[Rajasuya]] ceremony to proclaim his supremacy. Prithviraj refused to participate in this ceremony, and thus, refused to acknowledge Jaichand as the supreme king. Jaichand's daughter Samyogita fell in love with Prithviraj after hearing about his heroic exploits, and declared that she would marry only him. Jaichand arranged a [[swayamvara]] (husband-selection) ceremony for his daughter, but did not invite Prithviraj. Nevertheless, Prithviraj marched to Kannauj with a hundred warriors and eloped with Samyogita. Two-third of his warriors sacrificed their life in fight against the Gahadavala army, allowing him to escape to Delhi with Samyogita. In Delhi, Prithviraj became infatuated with his new wife, and started spending most of his time with her. He started ignoring the state affairs, which ultimately led to his defeat against [[Muhammad of Ghor]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nThis legend is also mentioned in [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and Chandrashekhara's ''Surjana-Charita'' (which names the Gahadavala princess as \"Kantimati\"). ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Prithviraj fell in love with the incarnation of an [[apsara]] [[Tilottama]], although he had never seen this woman and was already married to other women. According to historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]], this is probably a reference to Samyogita. However, this legend is not mentioned in other historical sources such as ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'', ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', ''Prabandha-Kosha'' and ''Hammira-Mahakavya''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=78}} The Gahadavala records are also silent about this event, including the supposed Rajasuya performance by Jayachandra.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=175}}\n\nAccording to Dasharatha Sharma{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=79}} and R. B. Singh,{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=179}} there might be some historical truth in this legend, as it is mentioned in three different sources. All three sources place the event sometime before Prithviraj's final confrontation with [[Muhammad of Ghor]] in 1192 CE.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=80}}\n\n=== Other rulers ===\n[[File:Qila Rai Pithora 10.jpg|thumb|A statue at [[Qila Rai Pithora]] in Delhi]]\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction. No historical records suggest existence of these persons.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nThe construction of the now-ruined [[Qila Rai Pithora]] fort in [[Delhi]] is attributed to Prithviraj.{{sfn|Konstantin S Nossov|2012|p=53}} According to ''Prithviraj Raso'', Delhi's ruler [[Anangpal Tomar]] gave the city to his son-in-law Prithviraj, and was defeated when he wanted it back. This is historically inaccurate, as Delhi was annexed to the Chahamana territory by Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} In addition, historical evidence suggests that Anangpal Tomar died before the birth of Prithviraj. The claim about his daughter's marriage to Prithviraj appears to have been concocted at a later date.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=57}}\n\n== War with the Ghurids ==\n{{main article|First Battle of Tarain|Second Battle of Tarain}}\n\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the 12th century.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=33\u201334}} By the late 12th century, the [[Ghazna]]-based [[Ghurid dynasty]] controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom. While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor]] crossed the [[Indus River]] and captured [[Multan]]. In 1178 CE, he invaded [[Gujarat]], which was ruled by the [[Chaulukya]]s (Solankis). During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the [[Bhati]]-ruled [[Lodhruva]].{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=40\u201342}} The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like [[Rahu]] to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a [[solar eclipse]]). However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}} On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the [[Naddula]] (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]]. Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the [[Battle of Kasahrada]] in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nOver the next few years, Muhammad of Ghor consolidated his power in the territory to the west of the Chahamanas, conquering [[Peshawar]], [[Sindh]], and [[Punjab]]. He shifted his base from Ghazna to Punjab, and made attempts to expand his empire eastwards, which brought him into conflict with Prithviraj.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=183\u201384}}\n\n''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Muhammad of Ghor sent an ambassador to Prithviraj, but does not provide any details.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' (13th century CE) states that Muhammad sent his chief judge ''Qiwam-ul Mulk'' Ruknud Din Hamza to Prithviraj's court. The envoy tried to convince Prithviraj to \"abandon belligerence and pursue the path of rectitude\", but was unsuccessful. As a result, Muhammad decided to wage a war against Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe medieval Muslim writers mention only one or two battles between the two rulers. The ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' and ''[[Firishta|Tarikh-i-Firishta]]'' mention the two Battles of Tarain. ''Jami-ul-Hikaya'' and ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' mention only the second battle of Tarain, in which Prithviraj was defeated. However, the Hindu and Jain writers state that Prithviraj defeated Muhammad multiple times before being killed:{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that after defeating Muhammad for the first time, Prithviraj forced him to apologize to the princes whose territories he had ransacked, before letting him go. Muhammad invaded the Chahamana kingdom seven more times, but was defeated each time. However, his ninth invasion succeeded.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prithviraja Prabandha'' states that the two kings fought 8 battles;{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}} Prithviraj defeated and captured the Ghurid king in the first seven of these, but released him unharmed each time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}}\n* The ''Prabandha Kosha'' claims that Prithviraj captured Muhammad 20 times, but was himself imprisoned during the 21st battle. The ''Surjana Charita'' and ''Prithviraj Raso'' also enumerate 21 battles.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prabandha Chintamani'' gives the number of battles between Muhammad and Prithviraj as 22. It also states that Prithviraj's army defeated the preceding enemy king in a previous battle, in which a subordinate of Prithviraj heroically sacrificed himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=51}}\n\nWhile these accounts seem to exaggerate the number, it is possible that more than two engagements took place between the Ghurids and the Chahamanas during Prithviraj's reign.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=189}} The early victories mentioned by the Hindu and Jain writers probably refer to Prithviraj's successful repulsion of raids by Ghurid generals.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=81}}\n\n=== First battle of Tarain ===\n\nDuring 1190\u20131191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with [[Bathinda]]). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the [[Qadi|Qazi]] of [[Tulak District|Tulak]], supported by 1200 horsemen. When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of [[Delhi]]. According to the 16th-century Muslim historian [[Firishta]], his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}}\n\nMuhammad's original plan was to return to his base after conquering Tabarhindah, but when he heard about Prithviraj's march, he decided to put up a fight. He set out with an army, and encountered Prithviraj's forces at [[Tarain]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}} In the ensuing battle, Prithviraj's army decisively defeated the Ghurids. Muhammad of Ghor was injured and forced to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=82\u201384}}\n\nPrithviraj did not pursue the retreating Ghurid army, not wanting to invade hostile territory or misjudge Ghori's ambition.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} He only besieged the Ghurid garrison at Tabarhindah, which surrendered after 13 months of siege.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\n=== Second battle of Tarain ===\n[[File:The last stan of Rajputs against Muhammadans.jpg|thumb|A 19th century [[artist's impression|artist's imagination]] of the Second battle of Tarain]]\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight. This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor. According to ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad of Ghor returned to [[Ghazna]], and made preparations to avenge his defeat. According to ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'', he gathered a well-equipped army of 120,000 select [[Afghans|Afghan]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] horsemen over the next few months. He then marched towards the Chahamana kingdom via [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], aided by Vijayaraja of [[Jammu]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\nPrithviraj had been left without any allies as a result of his wars against the neighbouring Hindu kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=88}} Nevertheless, he managed to gather a large army to counter the Ghurids. The 16th century Muslim historian [[Firishta]] estimated the strength of Prithviraj's army as 300,000 horses and 3,000 elephants, in addition to a large infantry.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}} This is most likely a gross exaggeration, aimed at emphasizing the scale of the Ghurid victory.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} Prithviraj's camp, which comprised 150 feudatory chiefs, wrote a letter to Muhammad of Ghor, promising him no harm if he decided to return to his own country. Muhammad insisted that he needed time to confer his [[Ghazna]]-based brother [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad|Ghiyath al-Din]]. According to Firishta, he agreed to a truce until he received an answer from his brother. However, he planned an attack against the Chahamanas.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]'', Muhammad assigned a few men to keep the fires in his camp burning at night, while he marched off in another direction with the rest of his army. This gave the Chahamanas an impression that the Ghurid army was still encamped, observing the truce. After reaching several miles away, Muhammad formed four divisions, with 10,000 archers each. He kept the rest of his army in reserve. He ordered the four divisions to launch an attack on the Chahamana camp, and then pretend a retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAt dawn, the four divisions of the Ghurid army attacked the Chahamana camp, while Prithviraj was still asleep. After a brief fight, the Ghurid divisions pretended to retreat in accordance with Muhammad's strategy. Prithviraj was thus lured into chasing them, and by the afternoon, the Chahamana army was exhausted as a result of this pursuit. At this point, Muhammad led his reserve force and attacked the Chahamanas, decisively defeating them. According to ''Taj-ul-Maasir'', Prithviraj's camp lost 100,000 men (including Govindaraja of Delhi) in this debacle. Prithviraj himself tried to escape on a horse, but was pursued and caught near the Sarasvati fort (possibly modern [[Sirsa]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=86}} Subsequently, Muhammad of Ghor captured Ajmer after killing several thousand defenders, enslaved many more, and destroyed the city's temples.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n=== Jain accounts of Prithviraj's downfall ===\n\n''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' by the 14th century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge. Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured. {{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\n''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' by the 15th century Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri states that after his initial defeat, the Ghurid king raised a fresh army with the support of a neighboring king, and marched to Delhi. Before the battle, he bribed Prithviraj's master of horses and musicians with gold coins. The master of horses had trained Prithviraj's horse to prance to drumbeats. The Ghurids attacked the Chahamana camp just before dawn, when Prithviraj was sleeping. Prithviraj tried to escape on his horse, but his musicians sounded the drums. The horse started prancing, and the invaders easily captured Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\nAccording to another Jain text, ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]'', Prithviraj's minister Kaimbasa and his spear-bearer Pratapasimha were not on good terms. Kaimbasa once complained to king against Pratapasimha, who convinced the king that Kaimbasa was aiding the Ghurids. An angry Prithviraj attempted to kill Kaimbasa with an arrow one night, but ended up killing another man. When his bard Chand Baliddika admonished him, the king dismissed both the bard and the minister.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}} At the time of Ghurid invasion of Delhi, Prithviraj had been sleeping for ten days. When the Ghurids came close, his sister woke him up: Prithviraj tried to flee on a horse, but Kaimbasa helped the Ghurids capture him by telling them about a certain sound that caused his horse to prance.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Pritviraj Chauhan coins.jpg|thumb|Coins of Prithviraj Chauhan]]\n\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital [[Ajmer]], where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid [[vassal]]. Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}} This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}} although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince [[Govindaraja IV|Govindaraja]] on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}}\n\nThe various sources differ on the exact circumstances:{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n* The contemporary Muslim historian Hasan Nizami states that Prithviraj was caught conspiring against Muhammad, prompting the Ghurid king to order his beheading. Nizami does not describe the nature of this conspiracy.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* According to ''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' (c. 1304), Muhammad took him to Ajmer, intending to let him rule as a vassal. However, in Ajmer, he saw paintings depicting Muslims being killed by pigs in the Chahamana gallery. Enraged, he beheaded Prithviraj with an axe.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n* ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' states that Prithviraj refused to eat food after being captured. The noblemen of the Ghurid king suggested that he release Prithviraj, just like the Chahamana king had done to him in the past. But Muhammad ignored their advice, and Prithviraj died in captivity.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' (dated 15th century or earlier) states the Ghurids placed Prithviraj in gold chains, and brought him to Delhi. Prithviraj reproached the Ghurid king for not following his example of releasing the captured enemy. Some days later, while imprisoned in Ajmer, Prithviraj asked his ex-minister Kaimbasa for his bow-and-arrows to kill Muhammad in the court, which was held in front of the house where he was imprisoned. The treacherous minister supplied him the bow-and-arrows, but secretly informed Muhammad of his plan. As a result, Muhammad did not sit at his usual place, and instead kept a metal statue there. Prithviraj fired an arrow at the statue, breaking it into two. As a punishment, Muhammad had him cast into a pit and [[stoning|stoned]] to death.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=54}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=206-207}}\n\nThe 13th-century Persian historian [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]] states that Prithviraj was \"sent to hell\" after being captured. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] also supports this account.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} According to historian [[Satish Chandra]], Minhaj's account suggests that Prithviraj was executed immediately after his defeat,{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=26}} but R. B. Singh believes that no such conclusion can be drawn from Minhaj's writings.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} ''Viruddha-Vidhi Vidhvansa'' by the Hindu writer Lakshmidhara claims that Prithviraj was killed on the battlefield.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that Prithviraj was taken to Ghazna as a prisoner, and blinded. On hearing this, the poet [[Chand Bardai]] traveled to Ghazna and tricked Muhammad of Ghor into watching an archery performance by the blind Prithviraj. During this performance, Prithviraj shot the arrow in the direction of Muhammad's voice and killed him.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}} Shortly after, Prithviraj and Chand Bardai killed each other.<ref>Krishnadatt Paliwal (1988) \"Epic (Hindi)\" ''In'' Datta, Amaresh (1988) ''The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature: Volume Two: Devraj to Jyoti'', Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, India, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1178 page 1178], {{ISBN|81-260-1194-7}}</ref> This is a fictional narrative, not supported by historical evidence: Muhammad of Ghor continued to rule for more than a decade after Prithviraj's death.<ref name=\"Kaviraj\">Kaviraj Syamaldas (1886) \"The Antiquity, Authenticity and Genuineness of the epic called the Prithviraj Rasa and commonly ascribed to Chand Bardai\" Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. 55, pt.1,</ref>{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\nAfter Prithviraj's death, the Ghurids appointed his son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer as their vassal.

Govindaraja moved to Ranastambhapura (modern [[Ranthambore Fort|Ranthambore]]), where he established a [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|new Chahamana branch]] of vassal rulers.

In contrast, the ''Hammira Mahakavya'', also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed. The ''Hammira Mahakavya'', which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two ''Prabandha'' texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', a legendary text patronized largely by the [[Rajput]] courts,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=13}} portrays Prithviraj as a great hero.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=32}} Prithviraj's dynasty was classified as one of the Rajput clans in the later period, including in ''Prithviraj Raso'', although the \"Rajput\" identity did not exist during his time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=33, 121}}\n\nOver time, Prithviraj came to be portrayed as a patriotic Hindu warrior who fought against Muslim enemies.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=24}} He is remembered as a king whose reign separated the two major epochs of Indian history.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=5}} The convention of portraying Prithviraj as a Hindu king defeated as part of the Islamic conquest of India appears to have started with [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' (early 13th century). Nizami presents his narrative as a description of \"war with enemies of the faith\" and of how \"the Islamic way of life was established in the land of the Hindus.\"{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' as well as well as the later text ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' (c. 1260) present the Ghurid victory over Prithviraj as an important milestone leading to the establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=49}}\n\nThe 16th century legends describe him as the ruler of India's political centre [[Delhi]] (rather than [[Ajmer]], which was his actual capital).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=6\u20137}} For example, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' does not associate the Chahamana dynasty with Ajmer at all.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=73}} Prithviraj's association with Delhi in these legends further strengthened his status as a symbol of pre-Islamic Indian power.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=26}}\n\nPrithviraj has been described as \"the last Hindu emperor\" in eulogies. This designation is inaccurate, as several stronger Hindu rulers flourished in [[South India]] after him, and even some contemporary Hindu rulers in northern India were at least as powerful as him. Nevertheless, the 19th century British officer [[James Tod]] repeatedly used this term to describe Prithviraj in his ''Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han''. Tod was influenced by the medieval [[Persian language]] Muslim accounts, which present Prithviraj as a major ruler and portray his defeat as a major milestone in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]]. After Tod, several narratives continued to describe Prithviraj as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=3}} For example, the inscriptions at the Ajmer memorial (''smarak'') to Prithviraj also honour him as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=16}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=265}} A number of movies and television serials have been made on his life.

He ruled [[Sapadalaksha]], the traditional Chahamana territory, in present-day north-western India. He controlled much of the present-day [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], and [[Delhi]]; and some parts of [[Punjab]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. His capital was located at Ajayameru (modern [[Ajmer]]), although the medieval folk legends describe him as the king of India's political centre Delhi to portray him as a representative of the pre-Islamic Indian power.\n\nEarly in his career, Prithviraj achieved military successes against several neighbouring Hindu kingdoms, most notably against the [[Chandelas of Jejakabhukti|Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]]. He also repulsed the early invasions by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], a ruler of the Muslim [[Ghurid]] dynasty. However, in 1192 CE, the Ghurids defeated Prithviraj at the [[Second battle of Tarain]], and executed him shortly after. His defeat at Tarain is seen as a landmark event in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]], and has been described in several semi-legendary accounts. The most popular of these accounts is ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', which presents him as a \"[[Rajput]]\", although the Rajput identity did not exist during his time.\n\n== Sources of information ==\n\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number, and were not issued by the king himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=38}} Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles. Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval ''[[k\u0101vya|kavya]]''s (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors. These include ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'', ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' and ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]''. These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=37}} ''Prithviraj Raso'', which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by the king's court poet [[Chand Bardai]]. However, it is full of exaggerated accounts many of which are worthless for the purposes of history.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nOther chronicles and texts that mention Prithviraj include ''[[Prabandha-Chintamani]]'', ''[[Prabandha Kosha]]'' and ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]''. These were composed centuries after his death, and contain exaggerations and [[anachronistic]] anecdotes.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Prithviraj has also been mentioned in ''[[Kharatara Gaccha|Kharatara-Gachchha]]-[[Pattavali]]'', a Sanskrit text containing biographies of the Kharatara [[Jainism|Jain]] monks. While the work was completed in 1336 CE, the part that mentions Prithviraj was written around 1250 CE.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} The ''[[Alha-Khand]]a'' (or ''Alha Raso'') of the [[Chandela]] poet Jaganika also provides an exaggerated account of Prithviraj's war against the Chandelas.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}\n\nSome other Indian texts also mention Prithviraj, but do not provide much information of historical value. For example, the Sanskrit poem anthology ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' (1363) contains a verse praising him, and the ''[[Kanhadade Prabandha]]'' (1455) mentions him as an earlier incarnation of the [[Chahamanas of Jalor|Jalore Chahamana]] king [[Viramadeva|Viramade]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=50}}\n\n== Early life ==\nPrithviraj was born to the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] king [[Someshvara (Chahamana dynasty)|Someshvara]] and queen Karpuradevi (a [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] princess).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} Both Prithviraj and his younger brother [[Hariraja]] were born in [[Gujarat]], where their father Someshvara was brought up at the [[Chaulukya]] court by his maternal relatives.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the [[Jyeshtha (month)|Jyeshtha month]]. The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the [[horoscope|astrological planetary positions]] at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious. Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, [[Dasharatha Sharma]] calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=18}}\n\nThe medieval biographies of Prithviraj suggest that he was educated well. The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he mastered 6 languages; the ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that he learned 14 languages, which appears to be an exaggeration. The ''Raso'' goes on to claim that he became well-versed in a number of subjects, including history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy ([[mimamsa]]), and theology. Both the texts state that he was particularly proficient in [[archery]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=161}}\n\n== Early reign ==\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of [[Prithviraja II]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=156}} Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old. The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year. Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the [[regent]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then [[Vanaprastha|retired to the forest]]. However, this is doubtful.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nDuring his early years as the king, Prithviraj's mother managed the administration, assisted by a regency council.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nKadambavasa served as the chief minister of the kingdom during this period. He is also known as Kaimasa, Kaimash or Kaimbasa in the folk legends, which describe him as an able administrator and soldier devoted to the young king.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he was responsible for all the military victories during the early years of Prithviraj's reign. According to two different legends, Kadambavasa was later killed by Prithviraj. The ''Prithviraja-Raso'' claims that Prithviraj killed the minister after finding him in the apartment of the king's favourite concubine Karnati. ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' claims that a man named Pratapa-Simha conspired against the minister, and convinced Prithviraj that the minister was responsible for the repeated Muslim invasions. Both these claims appear to be historically inaccurate, as the much more historically reliable ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' does not mention any such incident.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nBhuvanaikamalla, the paternal uncle of Prithviraj's mother, was another important minister during this time.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', he was a valiant general who served Prithviraj as [[Garuda]] serves [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=163}} The text also states that he was \"proficient in the art of subduing ''n\u0101ga''s\". According to the 15th-century historian [[Jonaraja]], \"naga\" here refers to elephants. However, [[Har Bilas Sarda]] interpreted Naga as the name of a tribe, and theorized that Bhuvanaikamalla defeated this tribe.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Prithviraj assumed actual control of the administration in 1180 CE (1237 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\n== Conflicts with Hindu rulers ==\n\n=== Nagarjuna ===\n\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Gu\u1e0dapura; possibly modern [[Gurgaon]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]], and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Nagarjuna rebelled against Prithviraj's authority and occupied the fort of Gudapura.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=164}} Prithviraj besieged Gudapura with a large army comprising [[infantry]], [[camel cavalry|camels]], [[war elephant|elephants]] and [[horse cavalry|horses]]. Nagarjuna fled the fort, but Devabhata (possibly his general) continued to offer resistance. Ultimately, Prithviraj's army emerged victorious, and captured the wife, mother, and followers of Nagarjuna. According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', a garland made of the defeated soldiers' heads was hung across the Ajmer fort gate.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Bhadanakas ===\n\nTwo verses of ''Kharatara-Gachchha-[[Pattavali]]'' mention the victory of Prithviraj over the Bhadanakas, while describing a debate between two [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]. This victory can be dated to sometime before 1182 CE, when the said debate took place.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nAccording to Cynthia Talbot, the Bhadanakas were an obscure dynasty who controlled the area around [[Bayana]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} According to Dasharatha Sharma, the Bhadanaka territory comprised the area around present-day [[Bhiwani district|Bhiwani]], [[Rewari district|Rewari]] and [[Alwar district|Alwar]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Chandelas of Jejakabhukti ===\n\nThe 1182\u201383 CE (1239 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day [[Bundelkhand]]), which was ruled by the [[Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}} Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as ''Prithviraj Raso'', ''Paramal Raso'', and ''[[Alha-Khand|Alha-Raso]]''.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=47}} Other texts such as ''Sarangadhara Paddhati'' and ''Prabandha Chintamani'' also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=168}} The ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a ''digvijaya'' (conquest of all the regions). This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nThe legendary account of Prithviraj's campaign against the Chandelas goes like this: Prithviraj was returning to [[Delhi]] after marrying the daughter of Padamsen, when his contingent was attacked by the \"Turkic\" forces ([[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]]). His army repulsed the attacks, but suffered serious casualties in the process. Amid this chaos, the Chahamana soldiers lost their way, and unknowingly encamped in the Chandela capital [[Mahoba]]. They killed the Chandela royal gardener for objecting to their presence, which led to a skirmish between the two sides. The Chandela king Paramardi asked his general [[Udal of Mahoba|Udal]] to attack Prithviraj's camp, but Udal advised against this move. Paramardi's brother-in-law Mahil Parihar ruled modern-day [[Orai]]; he harboured ill-will against Paramardi, and instigated the king to go ahead with the attack. Prithviraj defeated Udal's contingent, and then left for Delhi. Subsequently, unhappy with Mahil's scheming, Udal and his brother [[Alha]] left the Chandela court. They started serving [[Jaichand]], the [[Gahadavala]] ruler of [[Kannauj]]. Mahil then secretly informed Prithviraj that Chandela kingdom had become weak in absence of its strongest generals. Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom, and besieged Sirsagarh, which was held by Udal's cousin Malkhan. After failing to win over Malkhan through peaceful methods and losing eight generals, Prithviraj captured the fort. The Chandelas then appealed for a truce, and used this time to recall Alha and Udal from Kannauj. In support of the Chandelas, Jaichand dispatched an army led by his best generals, including two of his own sons. The combined Chandela-Gahadavala army attacked Prithviraj's camp, but was defeated. After his victory, Prithviraj sacked Mahoba. He then dispatched his general Chavand Rai to [[Kalinjar Fort]] to capture Paramardi. According to the various legends, Paramardi either died or retired shortly after the attack. Prithviraj returned to Delhi after appointing Pajjun Rai as the governor of Mahoba. Later, Paramardi's son recaptured Mahoba.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=120\u201325}}\n\nThe exact historicity of this legendary narrative is debatable. The Madanpur inscriptions establish that Prithviraj sacked Mahoba, but historical evidence indicates that he did not occupy Mahoba or Kalinjar. It is known that Paramardi did not die or retire immediately after the Chauhan victory; in fact, he continued ruling as a sovereign nearly a decade after Prithviraj's death.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=124\u201326}} It appears that Prithviraj only raided Jejakabhukti, and Paramardi regained control of his kingdom soon after his departure from Mahoba. Prithviraj was not able to annex the Chandela territory to his kingdom.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}}\n\n=== Chaulukyas of Gujarat ===\n\nThe ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and [[Bhima II]], the [[Chaulukya]] (Solanki) king of [[Gujarat]]. This implies that the two kings were previously at war.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]). The [[Veraval]] inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=75}} Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=55}}\n\nThe historically unreliable ''Prithviraj Raso'' provides some details about the Chahamana-Chaulukya struggle.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}} According to it, both Prithviraj and Bhima wanted to marry Ichchhini, the Paramara princess of Abu. Prithviraj's marriage to her led to a rivalry between the two kings. Historian [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|G. H. Ojha]] dismisses this legend as fiction, because it states that Ichchhini was a daughter of Salakha, while Dharavarsha was the Paramara ruler of Abu at the time. Historian R. B. Singh, on the other hand, believes that Salakha was the head of another Paramara branch at Abu.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=170}} The ''Raso'' also mentions that Prithviraj's uncle Kanhadeva had killed seven sons of Bhima's uncle Sarangadeva. To avenge these murders, Bhima invaded the Chahamana kingdom and killed Prithviraj's father Someshvara, capturing [[Nagor]] in the process.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=171}} Prithviraj re-captured Nagor, and defeated and killed Bhima. This is known to be historically false, as the reign of Bhima II lasted nearly half a century after Prithviraj's death. Similarly, historical evidence suggests Bhima II was a child at the time of Someshvara's death, and therefore, could not have killed him.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\nDespite these discrepancies, there is some evidence of a battle between the Chahamanas and the Chaulukyas at Nagor. Two inscriptions found at Charlu village near [[Bikaner]] commemorate the death of [[Mohil]] soldiers at the battle of Nagor in 1184 CE (1241 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]). The Mohils are a branch of the Chauhans (the Chahamanas), and it is possible the inscriptions refer to the battle described in ''Prithviraj Raso''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=76\u201377}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=172\u201373}}\n\nSometime before 1187 CE, Jagaddeva Pratihara signed a peace treaty with Prithviraj. According to ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'', a chief named Abhayada once sought Jagaddeva's permission to attack and rob the wealthy visitors from Sapadalaksha country (the Chahamana territory). In response, Jagaddeva told Abhayada that he had concluded a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty. Jaggadeva then threatened to have Abhayada sewn in a donkey's belly if he harassed the people of Sapadalaksha. Historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]] theorizes that the Chahamana-Chaulukya conflict ended with some advantage for Prithviraj, as Jagaddeva appears to have been very anxious to preserve the treaty.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Paramaras of Abu ===\n\n[[Mount Abu|Abu]] was ruled by the Chaulukya feudatory Dharavarsha, who belonged to a branch of the [[Paramara dynasty]]. ''Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga'' by his younger brother Prahaladana describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu. This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas. It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Gahadavalas of Kannauj ===\n\nThe [[Gahadavala]] kingdom, centered around [[Kannauj]] and headed by another powerful king [[Jaichand|Jayachandra]], was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom. According to a legend mentioned in ''Prithviraj Raso'', Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter [[Samyogita]], leading to a rivalry between the two kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nThe legend goes like this: King Jaichand (Jayachandra) of Kannauj decided to conduct a [[Rajasuya]] ceremony to proclaim his supremacy. Prithviraj refused to participate in this ceremony, and thus, refused to acknowledge Jaichand as the supreme king. Jaichand's daughter Samyogita fell in love with Prithviraj after hearing about his heroic exploits, and declared that she would marry only him. Jaichand arranged a [[swayamvara]] (husband-selection) ceremony for his daughter, but did not invite Prithviraj. Nevertheless, Prithviraj marched to Kannauj with a hundred warriors and eloped with Samyogita. Two-third of his warriors sacrificed their life in fight against the Gahadavala army, allowing him to escape to Delhi with Samyogita. In Delhi, Prithviraj became infatuated with his new wife, and started spending most of his time with her. He started ignoring the state affairs, which ultimately led to his defeat against [[Muhammad of Ghor]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nThis legend is also mentioned in [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and Chandrashekhara's ''Surjana-Charita'' (which names the Gahadavala princess as \"Kantimati\"). ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Prithviraj fell in love with the incarnation of an [[apsara]] [[Tilottama]], although he had never seen this woman and was already married to other women. According to historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]], this is probably a reference to Samyogita. However, this legend is not mentioned in other historical sources such as ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'', ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', ''Prabandha-Kosha'' and ''Hammira-Mahakavya''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=78}} The Gahadavala records are also silent about this event, including the supposed Rajasuya performance by Jayachandra.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=175}}\n\nAccording to Dasharatha Sharma{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=79}} and R. B. Singh,{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=179}} there might be some historical truth in this legend, as it is mentioned in three different sources. All three sources place the event sometime before Prithviraj's final confrontation with [[Muhammad of Ghor]] in 1192 CE.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=80}}\n\n=== Other rulers ===\n[[File:Qila Rai Pithora 10.jpg|thumb|A statue at [[Qila Rai Pithora]] in Delhi]]\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction. No historical records suggest existence of these persons.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nThe construction of the now-ruined [[Qila Rai Pithora]] fort in [[Delhi]] is attributed to Prithviraj.{{sfn|Konstantin S Nossov|2012|p=53}} According to ''Prithviraj Raso'', Delhi's ruler [[Anangpal Tomar]] gave the city to his son-in-law Prithviraj, and was defeated when he wanted it back. This is historically inaccurate, as Delhi was annexed to the Chahamana territory by Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} In addition, historical evidence suggests that Anangpal Tomar died before the birth of Prithviraj. The claim about his daughter's marriage to Prithviraj appears to have been concocted at a later date.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=57}}\n\n== War with the Ghurids ==\n{{main article|First Battle of Tarain|Second Battle of Tarain}}\n\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the 12th century.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=33\u201334}} By the late 12th century, the [[Ghazna]]-based [[Ghurid dynasty]] controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom. While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor]] crossed the [[Indus River]] and captured [[Multan]]. In 1178 CE, he invaded [[Gujarat]], which was ruled by the [[Chaulukya]]s (Solankis). During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the [[Bhati]]-ruled [[Lodhruva]].{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=40\u201342}} The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like [[Rahu]] to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a [[solar eclipse]]). However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}} On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the [[Naddula]] (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]]. Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the [[Battle of Kasahrada]] in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nOver the next few years, Muhammad of Ghor consolidated his power in the territory to the west of the Chahamanas, conquering [[Peshawar]], [[Sindh]], and [[Punjab]]. He shifted his base from Ghazna to Punjab, and made attempts to expand his empire eastwards, which brought him into conflict with Prithviraj.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=183\u201384}}\n\n''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Muhammad of Ghor sent an ambassador to Prithviraj, but does not provide any details.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' (13th century CE) states that Muhammad sent his chief judge ''Qiwam-ul Mulk'' Ruknud Din Hamza to Prithviraj's court. The envoy tried to convince Prithviraj to \"abandon belligerence and pursue the path of rectitude\", but was unsuccessful. As a result, Muhammad decided to wage a war against Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe medieval Muslim writers mention only one or two battles between the two rulers. The ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' and ''[[Firishta|Tarikh-i-Firishta]]'' mention the two Battles of Tarain. ''Jami-ul-Hikaya'' and ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' mention only the second battle of Tarain, in which Prithviraj was defeated. However, the Hindu and Jain writers state that Prithviraj defeated Muhammad multiple times before being killed:{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that after defeating Muhammad for the first time, Prithviraj forced him to apologize to the princes whose territories he had ransacked, before letting him go. Muhammad invaded the Chahamana kingdom seven more times, but was defeated each time. However, his ninth invasion succeeded.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prithviraja Prabandha'' states that the two kings fought 8 battles;{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}} Prithviraj defeated and captured the Ghurid king in the first seven of these, but released him unharmed each time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}}\n* The ''Prabandha Kosha'' claims that Prithviraj captured Muhammad 20 times, but was himself imprisoned during the 21st battle. The ''Surjana Charita'' and ''Prithviraj Raso'' also enumerate 21 battles.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prabandha Chintamani'' gives the number of battles between Muhammad and Prithviraj as 22. It also states that Prithviraj's army defeated the preceding enemy king in a previous battle, in which a subordinate of Prithviraj heroically sacrificed himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=51}}\n\nWhile these accounts seem to exaggerate the number, it is possible that more than two engagements took place between the Ghurids and the Chahamanas during Prithviraj's reign.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=189}} The early victories mentioned by the Hindu and Jain writers probably refer to Prithviraj's successful repulsion of raids by Ghurid generals.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=81}}\n\n=== First battle of Tarain ===\n\nDuring 1190\u20131191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with [[Bathinda]]). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the [[Qadi|Qazi]] of [[Tulak District|Tulak]], supported by 1200 horsemen. When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of [[Delhi]]. According to the 16th-century Muslim historian [[Firishta]], his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}}\n\nMuhammad's original plan was to return to his base after conquering Tabarhindah, but when he heard about Prithviraj's march, he decided to put up a fight. He set out with an army, and encountered Prithviraj's forces at [[Tarain]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}} In the ensuing battle, Prithviraj's army decisively defeated the Ghurids. Muhammad of Ghor was injured and forced to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=82\u201384}}\n\nPrithviraj did not pursue the retreating Ghurid army, not wanting to invade hostile territory or misjudge Ghori's ambition.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} He only besieged the Ghurid garrison at Tabarhindah, which surrendered after 13 months of siege.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\n=== Second battle of Tarain ===\n[[File:The last stan of Rajputs against Muhammadans.jpg|thumb|A 19th century [[artist's impression|artist's imagination]] of the Second battle of Tarain]]\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight. This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor. According to ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad of Ghor returned to [[Ghazna]], and made preparations to avenge his defeat. According to ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'', he gathered a well-equipped army of 120,000 select [[Afghans|Afghan]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] horsemen over the next few months. He then marched towards the Chahamana kingdom via [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], aided by Vijayaraja of [[Jammu]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\nPrithviraj had been left without any allies as a result of his wars against the neighbouring Hindu kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=88}} Nevertheless, he managed to gather a large army to counter the Ghurids. The 16th century Muslim historian [[Firishta]] estimated the strength of Prithviraj's army as 300,000 horses and 3,000 elephants, in addition to a large infantry.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}} This is most likely a gross exaggeration, aimed at emphasizing the scale of the Ghurid victory.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} Prithviraj's camp, which comprised 150 feudatory chiefs, wrote a letter to Muhammad of Ghor, promising him no harm if he decided to return to his own country. Muhammad insisted that he needed time to confer his [[Ghazna]]-based brother [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad|Ghiyath al-Din]]. According to Firishta, he agreed to a truce until he received an answer from his brother. However, he planned an attack against the Chahamanas.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]'', Muhammad assigned a few men to keep the fires in his camp burning at night, while he marched off in another direction with the rest of his army. This gave the Chahamanas an impression that the Ghurid army was still encamped, observing the truce. After reaching several miles away, Muhammad formed four divisions, with 10,000 archers each. He kept the rest of his army in reserve. He ordered the four divisions to launch an attack on the Chahamana camp, and then pretend a retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAt dawn, the four divisions of the Ghurid army attacked the Chahamana camp, while Prithviraj was still asleep. After a brief fight, the Ghurid divisions pretended to retreat in accordance with Muhammad's strategy. Prithviraj was thus lured into chasing them, and by the afternoon, the Chahamana army was exhausted as a result of this pursuit. At this point, Muhammad led his reserve force and attacked the Chahamanas, decisively defeating them. According to ''Taj-ul-Maasir'', Prithviraj's camp lost 100,000 men (including Govindaraja of Delhi) in this debacle. Prithviraj himself tried to escape on a horse, but was pursued and caught near the Sarasvati fort (possibly modern [[Sirsa]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=86}} Subsequently, Muhammad of Ghor captured Ajmer after killing several thousand defenders, enslaved many more, and destroyed the city's temples.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n=== Jain accounts of Prithviraj's downfall ===\n\n''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' by the 14th century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge. Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured. {{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\n''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' by the 15th century Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri states that after his initial defeat, the Ghurid king raised a fresh army with the support of a neighboring king, and marched to Delhi. Before the battle, he bribed Prithviraj's master of horses and musicians with gold coins. The master of horses had trained Prithviraj's horse to prance to drumbeats. The Ghurids attacked the Chahamana camp just before dawn, when Prithviraj was sleeping. Prithviraj tried to escape on his horse, but his musicians sounded the drums. The horse started prancing, and the invaders easily captured Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\nAccording to another Jain text, ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]'', Prithviraj's minister Kaimbasa and his spear-bearer Pratapasimha were not on good terms. Kaimbasa once complained to king against Pratapasimha, who convinced the king that Kaimbasa was aiding the Ghurids. An angry Prithviraj attempted to kill Kaimbasa with an arrow one night, but ended up killing another man. When his bard Chand Baliddika admonished him, the king dismissed both the bard and the minister.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}} At the time of Ghurid invasion of Delhi, Prithviraj had been sleeping for ten days. When the Ghurids came close, his sister woke him up: Prithviraj tried to flee on a horse, but Kaimbasa helped the Ghurids capture him by telling them about a certain sound that caused his horse to prance.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Pritviraj Chauhan coins.jpg|thumb|Coins of Prithviraj Chauhan]]\n\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital [[Ajmer]], where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid [[vassal]]. Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}} This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}} although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince [[Govindaraja IV|Govindaraja]] on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}}\n\nThe various sources differ on the exact circumstances:{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n* The contemporary Muslim historian Hasan Nizami states that Prithviraj was caught conspiring against Muhammad, prompting the Ghurid king to order his beheading. Nizami does not describe the nature of this conspiracy.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* According to ''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' (c. 1304), Muhammad took him to Ajmer, intending to let him rule as a vassal. However, in Ajmer, he saw paintings depicting Muslims being killed by pigs in the Chahamana gallery. Enraged, he beheaded Prithviraj with an axe.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n* ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' states that Prithviraj refused to eat food after being captured. The noblemen of the Ghurid king suggested that he release Prithviraj, just like the Chahamana king had done to him in the past. But Muhammad ignored their advice, and Prithviraj died in captivity.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' (dated 15th century or earlier) states the Ghurids placed Prithviraj in gold chains, and brought him to Delhi. Prithviraj reproached the Ghurid king for not following his example of releasing the captured enemy. Some days later, while imprisoned in Ajmer, Prithviraj asked his ex-minister Kaimbasa for his bow-and-arrows to kill Muhammad in the court, which was held in front of the house where he was imprisoned. The treacherous minister supplied him the bow-and-arrows, but secretly informed Muhammad of his plan. As a result, Muhammad did not sit at his usual place, and instead kept a metal statue there. Prithviraj fired an arrow at the statue, breaking it into two. As a punishment, Muhammad had him cast into a pit and [[stoning|stoned]] to death.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=54}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=206-207}}\n\nThe 13th-century Persian historian [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]] states that Prithviraj was \"sent to hell\" after being captured. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] also supports this account.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} According to historian [[Satish Chandra]], Minhaj's account suggests that Prithviraj was executed immediately after his defeat,{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=26}} but R. B. Singh believes that no such conclusion can be drawn from Minhaj's writings.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} ''Viruddha-Vidhi Vidhvansa'' by the Hindu writer Lakshmidhara claims that Prithviraj was killed on the battlefield.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that Prithviraj was taken to Ghazna as a prisoner, and blinded. On hearing this, the poet [[Chand Bardai]] traveled to Ghazna and tricked Muhammad of Ghor into watching an archery performance by the blind Prithviraj. During this performance, Prithviraj shot the arrow in the direction of Muhammad's voice and killed him.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}} Shortly after, Prithviraj and Chand Bardai killed each other.<ref>Krishnadatt Paliwal (1988) \"Epic (Hindi)\" ''In'' Datta, Amaresh (1988) ''The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature: Volume Two: Devraj to Jyoti'', Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, India, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1178 page 1178], {{ISBN|81-260-1194-7}}</ref> This is a fictional narrative, not supported by historical evidence: Muhammad of Ghor continued to rule for more than a decade after Prithviraj's death.<ref name=\"Kaviraj\">Kaviraj Syamaldas (1886) \"The Antiquity, Authenticity and Genuineness of the epic called the Prithviraj Rasa and commonly ascribed to Chand Bardai\" Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. 55, pt.1,</ref>{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\nAfter Prithviraj's death, the Ghurids appointed his son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer as their vassal. In 1192 CE, Prithviraj's younger brother [[Hariraja]] dethroned Govindaraja, and recaptured a part of his ancestral kingdom. Govindaraja moved to Ranastambhapura (modern [[Ranthambore Fort|Ranthambore]]), where he established a [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|new Chahamana branch]] of vassal rulers. Hariraja was later defeated by the Ghurid general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=100\u201301}}\n\n== Cultural activities ==\n\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for [[pandit]]s (scholars) and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha. His court had a number of poets and scholars, including:{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=88}}\n* Jayanaka, a poet-historian who wrote ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]''\n* Vidyapati Gauda\n* Vagisvara Janardana\n* Vishvarupa, a poet\n* Prithvibhata, a royal bard (identified as [[Chand Bardai]] by some scholars)\n\n''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions a debate that took place between the [[Jain]] monks Jinapati Suri and Padmaprabha at Naranayana (modern Narena near Ajmer). Prithviraj had encamped there at the time. Jinapati was later invited to Ajmer by a rich Jain merchant. There, Prithviraj issued him a ''jaya-patra'' (certificate of victory).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Inscriptions ===\n<mapframe text=\"Find-spots of inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign, in present-day India\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"5\" longitude=\"74.84\" latitude=\"25.98\">\n{\n\t\"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n\t\"features\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"Feature\",\n\t\t\t\"properties\": { \"marker-symbol\": \"star\", \"title\": \"[[Ajmer]]\", \"description\": \"Ajayameru (modern Ajmer) was the capital of Prithviraj.

In contrast, the ''Hammira Mahakavya'', also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed. The ''Hammira Mahakavya'', which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two ''Prabandha'' texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', a legendary text patronized largely by the [[Rajput]] courts,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=13}} portrays Prithviraj as a great hero.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=32}} Prithviraj's dynasty was classified as one of the Rajput clans in the later period, including in ''Prithviraj Raso'', although the \"Rajput\" identity did not exist during his time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=33, 121}}\n\nOver time, Prithviraj came to be portrayed as a patriotic Hindu warrior who fought against Muslim enemies.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=24}} He is remembered as a king whose reign separated the two major epochs of Indian history.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=5}} The convention of portraying Prithviraj as a Hindu king defeated as part of the Islamic conquest of India appears to have started with [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' (early 13th century). Nizami presents his narrative as a description of \"war with enemies of the faith\" and of how \"the Islamic way of life was established in the land of the Hindus.\"{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' as well as well as the later text ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' (c. 1260) present the Ghurid victory over Prithviraj as an important milestone leading to the establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=49}}\n\nThe 16th century legends describe him as the ruler of India's political centre [[Delhi]] (rather than [[Ajmer]], which was his actual capital).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=6\u20137}} For example, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' does not associate the Chahamana dynasty with Ajmer at all.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=73}} Prithviraj's association with Delhi in these legends further strengthened his status as a symbol of pre-Islamic Indian power.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=26}}\n\nPrithviraj has been described as \"the last Hindu emperor\" in eulogies. This designation is inaccurate, as several stronger Hindu rulers flourished in [[South India]] after him, and even some contemporary Hindu rulers in northern India were at least as powerful as him. Nevertheless, the 19th century British officer [[James Tod]] repeatedly used this term to describe Prithviraj in his ''Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han''. Tod was influenced by the medieval [[Persian language]] Muslim accounts, which present Prithviraj as a major ruler and portray his defeat as a major milestone in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]]. After Tod, several narratives continued to describe Prithviraj as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=3}} For example, the inscriptions at the Ajmer memorial (''smarak'') to Prithviraj also honour him as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=16}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=265}} A number of movies and television serials have been made on his life.
