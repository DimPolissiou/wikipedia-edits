The film was inspired by the [[California Water Wars]], a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century, by which Los Angeles interests secured water rights in the [[Owens Valley]].<ref>[https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/the-water-fight-that-inspired-chinatown/?searchResultPosition=8 Barringer, Felicity.

The [[Golden Globe Award]]s honored it for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. The [[American Film Institute]] placed it second among its [[AFI's 10 Top 10|top ten mystery films]] in 2008.\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Two Jakes]]'', was released in 1990, again starring Nicholson, who also directed, with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay. The film failed to generate the acclaim of its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1937, a woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires [[private investigator]] J. J. \"Jake\" Gittes to follow her husband, Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer for the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]]. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly refuse to create a new reservoir that would be unsafe, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman, which are published on the front page of the following day's paper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray and that he can expect a lawsuit.\n\nRealizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Hollis Mulwray is the real target. Before he can question him, Lieutenant Lou Escobar fishes Mulwray, drowned, from a reservoir. Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray, Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that although there is a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman who slashes one of Gittes' nostrils. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries.\n\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes' fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply.\n\nGittes deduces that the water department is drying up the land so it can be bought at a reduced price and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan. He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley's new landowners who seemingly purchased the property a week after his death. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the home and confirm that the real-estate deals were surreptitiously completed in the names of several of the home's residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious retirement-home director, who has called Mulvihill.\n\nAfter fleeing Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. During the night, Evelyn gets a phone call and must leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows Evelyn's car to a house, where he spies her through the windows comforting Mulwray's mistress, Katherine. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman against her will, but she says Katherine is her sister.\n\nThe next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions' apartment, where he finds her murdered and Escobar waiting for Gittes' arrival. Escobar tells him the coroner's report found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the fresh water of the reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At Evelyn's mansion, Gittes finds her servants packing her things. He realizes her garden pond is salt water and discovers a pair of [[bifocals]] in it. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. After Gittes slaps her, she tells him that Katherine is her sister ''and'' her daughter; her father raped her when she was 15. She says that the glasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\n\nGittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]]. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to annex the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray. Cross has Mulvihill take the bifocals at gunpoint, and they force Gittes to drive them to the women. When they reach the Chinatown address, the police are already there and detain Gittes. When Cross approaches Katherine, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and starts to drive away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released. Lawrence Walsh, one of Gittes's associates, tells him: \"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as J.

It taught me to look at the place where I was born, and convinced me to write about it.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Prophet: The Life and Work of Carey McWilliams|last=Richardson|first=Peter|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0472115242|location=Ann Arbor|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanprophetl00rich/page/260 260]|url=https://archive.org/details/americanprophetl00rich/page/260}}</ref>\n\nTowne wrote the screenplay with [[Jack Nicholson]] in mind.<ref name=\"dvd\" /> He took the title (and the exchange, \"What did you do in Chinatown?\" / \"As little as possible\") from a Hungarian [[vice cop]] who had worked in Chinatown and explained to the writer that the complicated array of dialects and gangs in Los Angeles's Chinatown made it impossible for the police to know whether their interventions were helping victims or furthering their exploitation.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nPolanski learned of the script through Nicholson, with whom he had been searching for a suitable joint project. Producer Robert Evans wanted Polanski to direct for his European vision of the United States, which Evans believed would be darker and more cynical. Polanski, a few years removed from the [[Tate murders|murder of his pregnant wife]], [[Sharon Tate]], in Los Angeles, was initially reluctant to return but was persuaded on the strength of the script.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nTowne wanted Cross to die and Evelyn Mulwray to survive. The screenwriter and director argued over it, with Polanski insisting on a tragic end. \"I knew that if ''Chinatown'' was to be special,\" Polanski said, \"not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die.\"<ref name=\"TCM\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=154968%7C28063&name=Chinatown \"Chinatown\"]. Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved August 22, 2012.</ref> They parted ways over this dispute and Polanski wrote the final scene a few days before it was shot.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nThe original script was more than 180 pages and included a narration by Gittes; Polanski cut that and reordered the story so the audience and Gittes unraveled the mysteries at the same time.\n\n===Characters and casting===\n* \"J. J. Gittes\" was named after Nicholson's friend, producer Harry Gittes.\n* \"Evelyn Mulwray\" is, according to Towne, intended to initially seem the classic \"black widow\" character typical of lead female characters in [[film noir]], yet is eventually made the only selfless character in the film. [[Jane Fonda]] was strongly considered for the role, but Polanski insisted on Dunaway.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n* \"Noah Cross\": Towne said that Huston was, after Nicholson, the second-best-cast actor in the film and that he made the Cross character menacing, through his courtly performance.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n* Polanski appears in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes' nose. The effect was accomplished with a special knife which indeed could have cut Nicholson's nose if Polanski had not held it correctly.\n\n===Filming===\n[[William A. Fraker]] accepted the cinematographer position from Polanski when Paramount agreed. He had worked with the studio previously on Polanski's ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. Robert Evans, never consulted about the decision, insisted that the offer be rescinded since he felt pairing Polanski and Fraker again would create a team with too much control over the project and complicate the production. Fraker was replaced by [[John A. Alonzo]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6owDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|last=Beach|first=Christopher|date=May 2015|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520284357|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with a technique Polanski attributes to [[Raymond Chandler]], all of the events of the film are seen subjectively through the main character's eyes; for example, when Gittes is knocked unconscious, the film fades to black and fades in when he awakens. Gittes appears in every scene of the film.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nOn set, Polanksi and Dunaway had well-documented conflict:<blockquote>...mediating pitched battles between the abrupt, abrasive Polanski and the temperamental, histrionic Dunaway was a challenge. \"She demonstrated certifiable proof of insanity,\" said Jack [Nicholson].\n\nHis favorite illustration of this was the parable of the hair. [Robert] Evans had flown in [[Ara Gallant]] from New York to streak Dunaway's coiffure for the movie, and in the course of one of Polanski's more complicated lighting setups, an errant hair escaped. During a scene set inside the Brown Derby restaurant, Polanski tried to shoot past the loose strand in what would otherwise have been a perfect 1930's [[Marcel wave|marcel]]: tight, blonde, and lacquered against her skull \u00e0 la [[Jean Harlow]]. But the vagrant hair glowed like a stalk of wild wheat in the [[klieg light]]s and Polanski sidled up and plucked it from Dunaway's scalp. She shrieked like a rape victim. \"Don't you dare ''ever'' do that sort of thing to me again!\" Dunaway remembered howling before she raced back to her trailer in tears. Polanski remembered it as: \"I just don't believe it! That motherfucker pulled my hair out!\"\n\nIt took a summit meeting in Evans's Paramount office before Dunaway returned to work. Polanski fanned the incident in the press as a perfect example of American star hysterics, while Dunaway insisted her hair wasn't the point. \"It was not the hair\", she said. \"It was the incessant cruelty that I felt, the constant sarcasm, the never-ending need to humiliate me.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=McDougal, Dennis.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/122261646|title=Five easy decades : how Jack Nicholson became the biggest movie star in modern times|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-72246-5|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=122261646}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Chinatown\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 1974\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Jazz]], [[soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n[[Jerry Goldsmith]] composed and recorded the film's score in ten days, after producer Robert Evans rejected Phillip Lambro's original effort at the last minute.

''Chinatown'' isn't a docudrama, it's a fiction. The water project it depicts isn't the construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]], engineered by [[William Mulholland]] before the First World War. ''Chinatown'' is set in 1938, not 1905. The Mullholland-like figure\u2014\"Hollis Mulwray\"\u2014isn't the chief architect of the project, but rather its strongest opponent, who must be discredited and murdered.  Mulwray is against the \"Alto Vallejo Dam\" because it's unsafe, not because it's stealing water from somebody else.... But there are echoes of Mullholland's aqueduct project in ''Chinatown''.... Mullholland's project enriched its promoters through insider land deals in the [[San Fernando Valley]], just like the dam project in ''Chinatown''. The disgruntled San Fernando Valley farmers of ''Chinatown'', forced to sell off their land at bargain prices because of an artificial drought, seem like stand-ins for the Owens Valley settlers whose homesteads turned to dust when Los Angeles took the water that irrigated them. The \"Van Der Lip Dam\" disaster, which Hollis Mulwray cites to explain his opposition to the proposed dam, is an obvious reference to the collapse of the [[Saint Francis Dam]] in 1928. Mullholland built this dam after completing the aqueduct and its failure was the greatest man-made disaster in the history of California.

The film failed to generate the acclaim of its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1937, a woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires [[private investigator]] J. J. \"Jake\" Gittes to follow her husband, Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer for the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]]. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly refuse to create a new reservoir that would be unsafe, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman, which are published on the front page of the following day's paper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray and that he can expect a lawsuit.\n\nRealizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Hollis Mulwray is the real target. Before he can question him, Lieutenant Lou Escobar fishes Mulwray, drowned, from a reservoir. Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray, Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that although there is a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman who slashes one of Gittes' nostrils. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries.\n\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes' fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply.\n\nGittes deduces that the water department is drying up the land so it can be bought at a reduced price and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan. He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley's new landowners who seemingly purchased the property a week after his death. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the home and confirm that the real-estate deals were surreptitiously completed in the names of several of the home's residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious retirement-home director, who has called Mulvihill.\n\nAfter fleeing Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. During the night, Evelyn gets a phone call and must leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows Evelyn's car to a house, where he spies her through the windows comforting Mulwray's mistress, Katherine. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman against her will, but she says Katherine is her sister.\n\nThe next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions' apartment, where he finds her murdered and Escobar waiting for Gittes' arrival. Escobar tells him the coroner's report found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the fresh water of the reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At Evelyn's mansion, Gittes finds her servants packing her things. He realizes her garden pond is salt water and discovers a pair of [[bifocals]] in it. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. After Gittes slaps her, she tells him that Katherine is her sister ''and'' her daughter; her father raped her when she was 15. She says that the glasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\n\nGittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]]. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to annex the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray. Cross has Mulvihill take the bifocals at gunpoint, and they force Gittes to drive them to the women. When they reach the Chinatown address, the police are already there and detain Gittes. When Cross approaches Katherine, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and starts to drive away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released. Lawrence Walsh, one of Gittes's associates, tells him: \"Forget it, Jake.

It taught me to look at the place where I was born, and convinced me to write about it.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Prophet: The Life and Work of Carey McWilliams|last=Richardson|first=Peter|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0472115242|location=Ann Arbor|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanprophetl00rich/page/260 260]|url=https://archive.org/details/americanprophetl00rich/page/260}}</ref>\n\nTowne wrote the screenplay with [[Jack Nicholson]] in mind.<ref name=\"dvd\" /> He took the title (and the exchange, \"What did you do in Chinatown?\" / \"As little as possible\") from a Hungarian [[vice cop]] who had worked in Chinatown and explained to the writer that the complicated array of dialects and gangs in Los Angeles's Chinatown made it impossible for the police to know whether their interventions were helping victims or furthering their exploitation.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nPolanski learned of the script through Nicholson, with whom he had been searching for a suitable joint project. Producer Robert Evans wanted Polanski to direct for his European vision of the United States, which Evans believed would be darker and more cynical. Polanski, a few years removed from the [[Tate murders|murder of his pregnant wife]], [[Sharon Tate]], in Los Angeles, was initially reluctant to return but was persuaded on the strength of the script.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nTowne wanted Cross to die and Evelyn Mulwray to survive. The screenwriter and director argued over it, with Polanski insisting on a tragic end. \"I knew that if ''Chinatown'' was to be special,\" Polanski said, \"not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die.\"<ref name=\"TCM\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=154968%7C28063&name=Chinatown \"Chinatown\"]. Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved August 22, 2012.</ref> They parted ways over this dispute and Polanski wrote the final scene a few days before it was shot.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nThe original script was more than 180 pages and included a narration by Gittes; Polanski cut that and reordered the story so the audience and Gittes unraveled the mysteries at the same time.\n\n===Characters and casting===\n* \"J. J. Gittes\" was named after Nicholson's friend, producer Harry Gittes.\n* \"Evelyn Mulwray\" is, according to Towne, intended to initially seem the classic \"black widow\" character typical of lead female characters in [[film noir]], yet is eventually made the only selfless character in the film. [[Jane Fonda]] was strongly considered for the role, but Polanski insisted on Dunaway.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n* \"Noah Cross\": Towne said that Huston was, after Nicholson, the second-best-cast actor in the film and that he made the Cross character menacing, through his courtly performance.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n* Polanski appears in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes' nose. The effect was accomplished with a special knife which indeed could have cut Nicholson's nose if Polanski had not held it correctly.\n\n===Filming===\n[[William A. Fraker]] accepted the cinematographer position from Polanski when Paramount agreed. He had worked with the studio previously on Polanski's ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. Robert Evans, never consulted about the decision, insisted that the offer be rescinded since he felt pairing Polanski and Fraker again would create a team with too much control over the project and complicate the production. Fraker was replaced by [[John A. Alonzo]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6owDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|last=Beach|first=Christopher|date=May 2015|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520284357|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with a technique Polanski attributes to [[Raymond Chandler]], all of the events of the film are seen subjectively through the main character's eyes; for example, when Gittes is knocked unconscious, the film fades to black and fades in when he awakens. Gittes appears in every scene of the film.<ref name=\"dvd\" />\n\nOn set, Polanksi and Dunaway had well-documented conflict:<blockquote>...mediating pitched battles between the abrupt, abrasive Polanski and the temperamental, histrionic Dunaway was a challenge. \"She demonstrated certifiable proof of insanity,\" said Jack [Nicholson].\n\nHis favorite illustration of this was the parable of the hair. [Robert] Evans had flown in Ara Gallant from New York to streak Dunaway's coiffure for the movie, and in the course of one of Polanski's more complicated lighting setups, an errant hair escaped. During a scene set inside the Brown Derby restaurant, Polanski tried to shoot past the loose strand in what would otherwise have been a perfect 1930's [[Marcel wave|marcel]]: tight, blonde, and lacquered against her skull \u00e0 la [[Jean Harlow]]. But the vagrant hair glowed like a stalk of wild wheat in the [[klieg light]]s and Polanski sidled up and plucked it from Dunaway's scalp. She shrieked like a rape victim. \"Don't you dare ''ever'' do that sort of thing to me again!\" Dunaway remembered howling before she raced back to her trailer in tears. Polanski remembered it as: \"I just don't believe it! That motherfucker pulled my hair out!\"\n\nIt took a summit meeting in Evans's Paramount office before Dunaway returned to work. Polanski fanned the incident in the press as a perfect example of American star hysterics, while Dunaway insisted her hair wasn't the point. \"It was not the hair\", she said. \"It was the incessant cruelty that I felt, the constant sarcasm, the never-ending need to humiliate me.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=McDougal, Dennis.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/122261646|title=Five easy decades : how Jack Nicholson became the biggest movie star in modern times|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-72246-5|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=122261646}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Chinatown\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 1974\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Jazz]], [[soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n[[Jerry Goldsmith]] composed and recorded the film's score in ten days, after producer Robert Evans rejected Phillip Lambro's original effort at the last minute.

''Chinatown'' isn't a docudrama, it's a fiction. The water project it depicts isn't the construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]], engineered by [[William Mulholland]] before the First World War. ''Chinatown'' is set in 1938, not 1905. The Mullholland-like figure\u2014\"Hollis Mulwray\"\u2014isn't the chief architect of the project, but rather its strongest opponent, who must be discredited and murdered.  Mulwray is against the \"Alto Vallejo Dam\" because it's unsafe, not because it's stealing water from somebody else.... But there are echoes of Mullholland's aqueduct project in ''Chinatown''.... Mullholland's project enriched its promoters through insider land deals in the [[San Fernando Valley]], just like the dam project in ''Chinatown''. The disgruntled San Fernando Valley farmers of ''Chinatown'', forced to sell off their land at bargain prices because of an artificial drought, seem like stand-ins for the Owens Valley settlers whose homesteads turned to dust when Los Angeles took the water that irrigated them. The \"Van Der Lip Dam\" disaster, which Hollis Mulwray cites to explain his opposition to the proposed dam, is an obvious reference to the collapse of the [[Saint Francis Dam]] in 1928. Mullholland built this dam after completing the aqueduct and its failure was the greatest man-made disaster in the history of California. These echoes have led many viewers to regard ''Chinatown'', not only as docudrama, but as truth\u2014the real secret history of how Los Angeles got its water. And it has become a ruling metaphor of the non-fictional critiques of Los Angeles development.<ref>Andersen, Thom (writer, director), voiceover narration in ''[[Los Angeles Plays Itself]]'' (2004), released (2014) by [[The Cinema Guild]].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}\nThe film earned $29 million at the North American box office.<ref name=BOM/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Chinatown'' holds an approval rating of 99% and an average rating of 9.31/10, with 66 out of 67 reviews being positive.
