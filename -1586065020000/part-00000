In 1338 the first permanent bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg was completed. In 1678 the city was taken over by [[France]], as it was considered to be part of the defence system of Strasbourg.

This annexation was recognised by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697, but all right-bank territories were restored to the Empire, leading to Kehl's cession to the [[Margraviate of Baden]] the following year.\n\nOn May 7, 1770, [[Marie Antoinette]] was officially handed over by [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] to France on an island on the Rhine near Kehl.

The village was badly damaged during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], especially during the [[Rhine Campaign of 1796]], during the [[Battle of Kehl (1796)|first]] and [[Second Battle of Kehl (1796)|second]] battles of Kehl, and it was [[Siege of Kehl (1796&ndash;97)|besieged]] by the Austrians in late 1796 until its surrender on 9 January 1797.  During the [[First French Empire]], Kehl was reunited with Strasbourg under the [[French First Republic]], before being restored to Baden ([[Electorate of Baden|now raised to an Electorate]]) in 1803.

It is located south of Tunisia. It is the capital of the [[Kebili Governorate]].\n\n== History ==\n\nKebili is one of the oldest oases in Tunisia and North Africa. It holds the earliest hard evidence of human habitation in [[Tunisia]] (found near the town) and dates back about 200,000 years.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eyewitness|first=D. K.|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=xGIpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22kebili%22+early+humans&source=bl&ots=dsH6hAA3ig&sig=ACfU3U1DQebIeASyOpogrQlBab-T18DjIA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi15N6rkc_nAhWEoXEKHSZXC-UQ6AEwD3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22kebili%22%20early%20humans&f=false|title=DK Eyewitness Tunisia|date=2016-06-01|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=978-0-241-24915-4|language=en}}</ref> Kebili, along with many other Tunisian cities, became part of the [[Roman Empire]] after the [[Punic Wars]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nKebili's population is more diverse compared to other Tunisian governorates. The population traces its roots to three main groups:\n\n*[[Berber people|Berbers]]: The native inhabitants of [[Tunisia]] and North Africa.\n*[[Arabs]]: They came to Kebili in the early days of the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest]]. Most came from the Southern Arabian Peninsula (modern day [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]). They still hold the tribal names of their ancestors.\n*[[Black people|Black Africans]]: They were brought to the city when it was a slavery trade center. See [[#Economy|the Economy section below]].\n\n== Language and religion ==\n\nWhile [[Arabic]] is the dominant language in the region, several differences set it apart from the [[Tunisian Arabic]] spoken elsewhere in the country. Most notably, the letter ''q\u0101f'' {{lang|ar|\u0642}} is pronounced as a {{IPAblink|g}} rather than the guttural {{IPAblink|q}}. Additionally, some villages use the feminine plural pronouns {{lang|ar|antunna}} {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646\u062a\u0646}} (plural you) and {{lang|ar|hunna}} {{lang|ar|\u0647\u0646}} (they). These pronouns are very rare throughout the Arab world and are usually replaced by their masculine counterparts {{lang|ar|antum}} {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646\u062a\u0645}} and {{lang|ar|hum}} {{lang|ar|\u0647\u0645}}. Bedouin vocabulary and expressions have declined in usage among the new generations.\n\n[[Islam]] is the dominant religion. Kebili, as many other Tunisian towns, holds a great number of Soofiat Maqams (Saleheen).{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; If true, which period? The majority of kebilian are Sunni|date=January 2012}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Kebili has seen diverse orientations throughout its history. Kebili was one of the main hubs of the African slavery trade to satisfy European needs. Slaves were taken to Europe through the port of [[Gab\u00e8s]]. Nowadays, Kebili relies heavily on agriculture and tourism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Kebili-village.JPG|thumb|right|Kebili village.]]\nThe main agricultural product in the region are [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] or \"deglets\". Kebili produces a very high quality date, exported all around the world and contributing significantly to the local and national economy.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nSince national independence, the government of Tunisia has encouraged tourism projects and resorts in the Saharan region. Of these [[Douz]], south of Kebili, is the most famous Saharian destination of Tunisia (known as the Sahara Gate).\n\n==Climate==\n\nTemperature records have been kept here from 1901\u20131939, 1949\u20131953, and 2000\u20132012. The French colonial authorities of the ''Service m\u00e9t\u00e9orologique de Tunis'' maintained the older records. A portion of the original data logs for this early period is in the [[National Climatic Data Center|NCDC]] archives and at the POR of 1907 to 1932. Like Azizia{{where|date=January 2016}}, Kebili is subject to the [[Foehn wind|foehn]]-like wind phenomena known as a Ghibili.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|location =

''{{audio|help=no|Gbili.wav|Gbill\u012b}}'') is a town in the south of [[Tunisia]] and one of the main cities in the [[Nefzaoua]] region. It is located south of Tunisia. It is the capital of the [[Kebili Governorate]].\n\n== History ==\n\nKebili is one of the oldest oases in Tunisia and North Africa. It holds the earliest hard evidence of human habitation in [[Tunisia]] (found near the town) and dates back about 200,000 years<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eyewitness|first=D. K.|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=xGIpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22kebili%22+early+humans&source=bl&ots=dsH6hAA3ig&sig=ACfU3U1DQebIeASyOpogrQlBab-T18DjIA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi15N6rkc_nAhWEoXEKHSZXC-UQ6AEwD3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22kebili%22%20early%20humans&f=false|title=DK Eyewitness Tunisia|date=2016-06-01|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=978-0-241-24915-4|language=en}}</ref>. Kebili, along with many other Tunisian cities, became part of the [[Roman Empire]] after the [[Punic Wars]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nKebili's population is more diverse compared to other Tunisian governorates. The population traces its roots to three main groups:\n\n*[[Berber people|Berbers]]: The native inhabitants of [[Tunisia]] and North Africa.\n*[[Arabs]]: They came to Kebili in the early days of the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest]]. Most came from the Southern Arabian Peninsula (modern day [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]). They still hold the tribal names of their ancestors.\n*[[Black people|Black Africans]]: They were brought to the city when it was a slavery trade center. See [[#Economy|the Economy section below]].\n\n== Language and religion ==\n\nWhile [[Arabic]] is the dominant language in the region, several differences set it apart from the [[Tunisian Arabic]] spoken elsewhere in the country. Most notably, the letter ''q\u0101f'' {{lang|ar|\u0642}} is pronounced as a {{IPAblink|g}} rather than the guttural {{IPAblink|q}}. Additionally, some villages use the feminine plural pronouns {{lang|ar|antunna}} {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646\u062a\u0646}} (plural you) and {{lang|ar|hunna}} {{lang|ar|\u0647\u0646}} (they). These pronouns are very rare throughout the Arab world and are usually replaced by their masculine counterparts {{lang|ar|antum}} {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0646\u062a\u0645}} and {{lang|ar|hum}} {{lang|ar|\u0647\u0645}}. Bedouin vocabulary and expressions have declined in usage among the new generations.\n\n[[Islam]] is the dominant religion. Kebili, as many other Tunisian towns, holds a great number of Soofiat Maqams (Saleheen).{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; If true, which period? The majority of kebilian are Sunni|date=January 2012}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Kebili has seen diverse orientations throughout its history. Kebili was one of the main hubs of the African slavery trade to satisfy European needs. Slaves were taken to Europe through the port of [[Gab\u00e8s]]. Nowadays, Kebili relies heavily on agriculture and tourism.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n[[File:Kebili-village.JPG|thumb|right|Kebili village.]]\nThe main agricultural product in the region are [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] or \"deglets\". Kebili produces a very high quality date, exported all around the world and contributing significantly to the local and national economy.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nSince national independence, the government of Tunisia has encouraged tourism projects and resorts in the Saharan region. Of these [[Douz]], south of Kebili, is the most famous Saharian destination of Tunisia (known as the Sahara Gate).\n\n==Climate==\n\nTemperature records have been kept here from 1901\u20131939, 1949\u20131953, and 2000\u20132012. The French colonial authorities of the ''Service m\u00e9t\u00e9orologique de Tunis'' maintained the older records. A portion of the original data logs for this early period is in the [[National Climatic Data Center|NCDC]] archives and at the POR of 1907 to 1932. Like Azizia{{where|date=January 2016}}, Kebili is subject to the [[Foehn wind|foehn]]-like wind phenomena known as a Ghibili.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|location =

The fraternity was founded as a result of friendships made while some of the founders fought in [[World War I]] in [[France]].<ref name=heritage35>Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 35. A Chain of Honor, 2nd Edition.</ref>\n\nThe fraternity went on to create new chapters on the campuses surrounding teachers' colleges (at the time also called \"[[normal school]]s\"). Since the Fraternity's beginnings in 1920, they have since spread to more than 175 [[university]] campuses across the United States.<ref name=chapter120>Bernier, William P. \"Chapter Roll\" page 120.

Parsons commented that in founding the Fraternity they wanted to sustain a \"sense of service, responsibility, and affection for their companions.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} These four, together with Allen Ross Nieman, Edward Henry McCune, Carl Nelson Chapman, Buell Wright McDaniel, George Eugene Hartrick, A. Barney Cott, Chiles Edward Hoffman, Rodney Edward Herndon, William Edward Billings, Clarence Willard Salter, Frank H.

Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, 20th Edition: 1991.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the founders were members of the [[College literary societies|Irving Literary Society]], but they wanted to create a new fraternity including members of other literary societies. On the morning of June 28, 1920, \"at an unusually early hour\" according to the original minutes, a list containing the names of about thirty men was posted on the college bulletin board by Emmett Ellis with a request to meet that afternoon.<ref name=heritage35/>\n\nAccording to the minutes, \"the notice had the proper effect and, as requested, there appeared a goodly number of men to learn what was in store for them.\" Founder Nieman, who had become familiar with fraternities while attending [[William Jewell College]], was the principal organizer of the meeting. He explained the purpose of the meeting and told them what such an organization could mean to the men of the college. The men elected Leland Hoback temporary Chairman and Emmett Ellis temporary Secretary. They agreed to begin crafting the organization and adjourned until July 7, 1920.\n\nThe founders were accompanied by Dr. Wilson C. Morris to present their petition to the faculty, who had been part of [[Sigma Nu]] in his college days. Dr. Morris became the Fraternity's first honorary member and served the alpha chapter at [[University of Central Missouri|Central Missouri]] as patron, counselor, and advisor until his death in 1947.<ref name=\"heritage36\">Bernier, William P. \"Our Heritage\" page 36.

The English word \"conscious\" originally derived from the Latin ''conscius'' (''con-'' \"together\" and [[wikt:scio|''scio'']] \"to know\"), but the Latin word did not have the same meaning as our word\u2014it meant \"knowing with\", in other words, \"having joint or common [[knowledge]] with another\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Studies in words |author =C.

Lewis}}</ref>  There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase ''conscius sibi'', which translates literally as \"knowing with oneself\", or in other words \"sharing knowledge with oneself about something\".  This phrase had the figurative meaning of \"knowing that one knows\", as the modern English word \"conscious\" does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word \"conscious\" retained the meaning of the Latin ''conscius''.  For example, [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: \"Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Leviathan: or, The Matter, Forme & Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill |author=Thomas Hobbes |publisher=University Press |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog/page/n62 39]|author-link=Thomas Hobbes }}</ref>  The Latin phrase ''conscius sibi'', whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as \"conscious to oneself\" or \"conscious unto oneself\".  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of \"being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}</ref>  Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.\n\nA related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]]. In the literal sense, \"conscientia\" means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge.

These have ranged from formal definitions to definitions attempting to capture the less easily captured and more debated meanings and usage of the word.\n\nOne formal definition indicating the range of these related meanings is given in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' stating that ''consciousness'' is:\n# <sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self'' <br/>\n{{spaces|16|thin}}<sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''inward awareness of an external object, state, or fact''<br/>\n{{spaces|16|thin}}<sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''concerned awareness: INTEREST, CONCERN\u2014often used with an attributive noun.''\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>''the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought: mind in the broadest possible sense: something in nature that is distinguished from the physical.''</li>\n<li>''the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span\u2014compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\"''</li></ol>\n\nThe [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines consciousness as \"''the state of understanding and realizing something.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/consciousness|title=CONSCIOUSNESS \u2013 meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref>\nThe [[Oxford Living Dictionary]] defines consciousness as \"''The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.''\", \"''A person's awareness or perception of something.''\" and \"''The fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consciousness|title=consciousness \u2013 Definition of consciousness in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries \u2013 English}}</ref>\n\nMost definitions include awareness, but some include a more general state of being.\n\n==Philosophy of mind==\nThe [[philosophy of mind]] has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness. The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' in 1998 defines consciousness as follows:\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014Philosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.<ref name=Craig>{{cite book |author=Edward Craig |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Consciousness |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18707-7|author-link=Edward Craig (philosopher) }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a more skeptical definition of ''consciousness'', [[Stuart Sutherland]] has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the 1989 version of the ''Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'':\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means.  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with [[self-consciousness]]\u2014to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.<ref name=Sutherland>{{cite book |author=Stuart Sutherland |title=Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology |publisher=Macmillan |chapter=Consciousness |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-38829-7|author-link=Stuart Sutherland }}</ref>}}\n\nMost writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of view, and have organized their material accordingly.  For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for example, Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues.\n\n===The coherence of the concept===\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.<ref name=\"Antony2001\"/>  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people (for instance, the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] versus [[Subjectivism|subjective]] aspects of consciousness), or else it encompasses a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common.<ref name=Velmans2009>{{cite journal |author=Max Velmans |title=How to define consciousness\u2014and how not to define consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2009 |volume=16 |pages=139\u2013156|author-link=Max Velmans }}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Justin Sytsma |author2=Edouard Machery |title=Two conceptions of subjective experience |journal=Philosophical Studies |year=2010 |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013327 |doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004888/01/Two_Conceptions_of_Subjective_Experience.pdf }}</ref> While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,<ref name=Antony2001/> skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions.  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualist]] outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of \"consciousness\" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.<ref name=RyleConsciousness>{{cite book|title=The Concept of Mind |author=Gilbert Ryle |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1949 |pages=156\u2013163|isbn=978-0-226-73296-1|title-link=The Concept of Mind |author-link=Gilbert Ryle }}</ref>  More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.<ref name=Sutherland/>\n\n===Types of consciousness===\n[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editor=N. Block |editor2=O. Flanagan |editor3=G.

These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called [[qualia]].  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,<ref name=\"D375\">{{cite book |author=Daniel Dennett |year=2004 |title=Consciousness Explained |page=375 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7139-9037-9|title-link=Consciousness Explained |author-link=Daniel Dennett }}</ref> others have broadly accepted it.

[[William Lycan]], for example, argued in his book ''Consciousness and Experience'' that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness ''of''; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)\u2014and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Lycan |title=Consciousness and Experience |pages=1\u20134 |year=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-12197-2|author-link=William Lycan }}</ref>\n\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately.  Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a \"zombie\" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding \"I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility.\" <ref>{{cite journal | author = Block N | year = 1995 | title = How many concepts of consciousness? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 272\u2013284 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038486}}</ref>\n\n===Mind\u2013body problem===\n{{main|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n[[Image:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of dualism by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].

Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).

She wrote:\n\n{{quote|It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine.&nbsp;...

His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are.  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols.  In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program.  Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean.  If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve.  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English.  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.<ref name=Searle1990>{{cite journal|author=John R.

The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use of the concept of consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired.

These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |author=Ezequiel Morsella |year=2005 |title=The function of phenomenal states: Supramodular Interaction Theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=112 |pages=1000\u20131021 |pmid=16262477 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.1000}}</ref> Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious.

The components that Tart identified have not, however, been validated by empirical studies.

[[Immanuel Kant]] asserted that the world as we perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental \"intuitions\", which include 'object' (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); 'shape'; 'quality' (color, warmth, etc.); 'space' (distance, direction, and location); and 'time'.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self |author=Andrew Brook |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/#3.2.1|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}  Note: translating Kant's terminology into English is often difficult.</ref> Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear.

The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the [[thalamus]] and then to the [[primary visual cortex]]; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion.<ref name=BennettHacker>{{cite book |title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience |first=M.R. |last=Bennett |editor1=Peter Michael |editor2=Stephan Hacker |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 |pages=121\u2013147}}</ref> Memory comes into play in at least two ways.

Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move.  When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense.  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies:  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him.  An even more striking type of anosognosia is [[Anton\u2013Babinski syndrome]], a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.<ref>{{cite book |editor=George Prigatano |editor2=[[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Anosognosia: possible neuropsychological mechanisms |author=Kenneth M.

According to James, the \"stream of thought\" is governed by five characteristics:  \"(1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. (4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. (5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others\".<ref>{{cite book|author=William James |title=The Principles of Psychology, Volume 1 |year=1890 |publisher=H.

The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour.  The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The purpose of the Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.<ref>{{cite book |title=Losing the Clouds, Gaining the Sky: Buddhism and the Natural Mind |chapter=Taming the mindstream |author=Dzogchen Rinpoche |editor=Doris Wolter |year=2007 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-359-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/losingcloudsgain0000unse/page/81 81\u201392] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/losingcloudsgain0000unse/page/81 }}</ref>\n\n=== Narrative form ===\n\nIn the west, the primary impact of the idea has been on literature rather than science:  [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness as a narrative mode]] means writing in a way that attempts to portray the moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences of a character.

This phrase had the figurative meaning of \"knowing that one knows\", as the modern English word \"conscious\" does.  In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word \"conscious\" retained the meaning of the Latin ''conscius''.  For example, [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' wrote: \"Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said to be Conscious of it one to another.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Leviathan: or, The Matter, Forme & Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civill |author=Thomas Hobbes |publisher=University Press |year=1904 |url=https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/leviathan00hobbgoog/page/n62 39]|author-link=Thomas Hobbes }}</ref>  The Latin phrase ''conscius sibi'', whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as \"conscious to oneself\" or \"conscious unto oneself\".  For example, [[Archbishop Ussher]] wrote in 1613 of \"being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The whole works, Volume 2 |author=[[James Ussher]], [[Charles Richard Elrington]] |page=417 |year=1613 |publisher=Hodges and Smith}}</ref>  Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.\n\nA related word was ''[[:la:conscientia|conscientia]]'', which primarily means [[morality|moral]] [[conscience]].

These have ranged from formal definitions to definitions attempting to capture the less easily captured and more debated meanings and usage of the word.\n\nOne formal definition indicating the range of these related meanings is given in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' stating that ''consciousness'' is:\n# <sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact: intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self'' <br/>\n{{spaces|16|thin}}<sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''inward awareness of an external object, state, or fact''<br/>\n{{spaces|16|thin}}<sub>{{resize|182%|\u2022}}</sub>&thinsp;&thinsp;''concerned awareness: INTEREST, CONCERN\u2014often used with an attributive noun.''\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>''the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought: mind in the broadest possible sense: something in nature that is distinguished from the physical.''</li>\n<li>''the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span\u2014compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\"''</li></ol>\n\nThe [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines consciousness as \"''the state of understanding and realizing something.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/consciousness|title=CONSCIOUSNESS \u2013 meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref>\nThe [[Oxford Living Dictionary]] defines consciousness as \"''The state of being aware of and responsive to one's surroundings.''\", \"''A person's awareness or perception of something.''\" and \"''The fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/consciousness|title=consciousness \u2013 Definition of consciousness in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries \u2013 English}}</ref>\n\nMost definitions include awareness, but some include a more general state of being.\n\n==Philosophy of mind==\nThe [[philosophy of mind]] has given rise to many stances regarding consciousness. The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' in 1998 defines consciousness as follows:\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014Philosophers have used the term 'consciousness' for four main topics: knowledge in general, intentionality, introspection (and the knowledge it specifically generates) and phenomenal experience... Something within one's mind is 'introspectively conscious' just in case one introspects it (or is poised to do so). Introspection is often thought to deliver one's primary knowledge of one's mental life. An experience or other mental entity is 'phenomenally conscious' just in case there is 'something it is like' for one to have it. The clearest examples are: perceptual experience, such as tastings and seeings; bodily-sensational experiences, such as those of pains, tickles and itches; imaginative experiences, such as those of one's own actions or perceptions; and streams of thought, as in the experience of thinking 'in words' or 'in images'. Introspection and phenomenality seem independent, or dissociable, although this is controversial.<ref name=Craig>{{cite book |author=Edward Craig |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Consciousness |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-18707-7|author-link=Edward Craig (philosopher) }}</ref>}}\n\nIn a more skeptical definition of ''consciousness'', [[Stuart Sutherland]] has exemplified some of the difficulties in fully ascertaining all of its cognate meanings in his entry for the 1989 version of the ''Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology'':\n{{quote|'''Consciousness'''\u2014The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means.  Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with [[self-consciousness]]\u2014to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.<ref name=Sutherland>{{cite book |author=Stuart Sutherland |title=Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology |publisher=Macmillan |chapter=Consciousness |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-38829-7|author-link=Stuart Sutherland }}</ref>}}\n\nMost writers on the philosophy of consciousness have been concerned with defending a particular point of view, and have organized their material accordingly.  For surveys, the most common approach is to follow a historical path by associating stances with the philosophers who are most strongly associated with them, for example, Descartes, Locke, Kant, etc. An alternative is to organize philosophical stances according to basic issues.\n\n===The coherence of the concept===\nMany philosophers have argued that consciousness is a unitary concept that is understood intuitively by the majority of people in spite of the difficulty in defining it.<ref name=\"Antony2001\"/>  Others, though, have argued that the level of disagreement about the meaning of the word indicates that it either means different things to different people (for instance, the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] versus [[Subjectivism|subjective]] aspects of consciousness), or else it encompasses a variety of distinct meanings with no simple element in common.<ref name=Velmans2009>{{cite journal |author=Max Velmans |title=How to define consciousness\u2014and how not to define consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |year=2009 |volume=16 |pages=139\u2013156|author-link=Max Velmans }}</ref>\n\nPhilosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Justin Sytsma |author2=Edouard Machery |title=Two conceptions of subjective experience |journal=Philosophical Studies |year=2010 |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013327 |doi=10.1007/s11098-009-9439-x|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00004888/01/Two_Conceptions_of_Subjective_Experience.pdf }}</ref> While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,<ref name=Antony2001/> skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions.  [[Gilbert Ryle]], for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualist]] outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of \"consciousness\" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.<ref name=RyleConsciousness>{{cite book|title=The Concept of Mind |author=Gilbert Ryle |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1949 |pages=156\u2013163|isbn=978-0-226-73296-1|title-link=The Concept of Mind |author-link=Gilbert Ryle }}</ref>  More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.<ref name=Sutherland/>\n\n===Types of consciousness===\n[[Ned Block]] proposed a distinction between two types of consciousness that he called ''phenomenal'' (P-consciousness) and ''access'' (A-consciousness).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editor=N. Block |editor2=O. Flanagan |editor3=G. Guzeldere |chapter=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |author=Ned Block |pages=375\u2013415 |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-262-52210-6 |publisher=MIT Press |chapter-url=http://cogprints.org/231/1/199712004.html|author-link=Ned Block }}</ref>  P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience:  it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called [[qualia]].  A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we [[perception|perceive]], information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we [[introspection|introspect]], information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we [[memory|remember]], information about the past is access conscious, and so on.  Although some philosophers, such as [[Daniel Dennett]], have disputed the validity of this distinction,<ref name=\"D375\">{{cite book |author=Daniel Dennett |year=2004 |title=Consciousness Explained |page=375 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-7139-9037-9|title-link=Consciousness Explained |author-link=Daniel Dennett }}</ref> others have broadly accepted it.  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging:  he calls this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].<ref name=ChalmersHardProblem>{{cite journal|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |author=David Chalmers |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308163649/http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |archivedate=2005-03-08 |df= |author-link=David Chalmers }}</ref>. [[Kong Derick]] has also stated that there are two type of consciousness which are; high level consciousness which he attributes to the mind and low level consciousness which he attributes to the submind.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kong Derick Njikeh |title=Derician Trialism: The Concept of Human Composition into the Mind, Submind and Body Substances/Components |publisher=International Journal of Philosophy |year=2019 |pages=17\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story.  [[William Lycan]], for example, argued in his book ''Consciousness and Experience'' that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness ''of''; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)\u2014and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Lycan |title=Consciousness and Experience |pages=1\u20134 |year=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-12197-2|author-link=William Lycan }}</ref>\n\nThere is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately.  Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a \"zombie\" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding \"I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility.\" <ref>{{cite journal | author = Block N | year = 1995 | title = How many concepts of consciousness? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 272\u2013284 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038486}}</ref>\n\n===Mind\u2013body problem===\n{{main|Mind\u2013body problem}}\n[[Image:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of dualism by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].

Descartes proposed that consciousness resides within an immaterial domain he called [[mental substance|res cogitans]] (the realm of thought), in contrast to the domain of material things, which he called [[res extensa]] (the realm of extension).<ref>{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Man: selected readings|last=Dy, Jr.|first=Manuel B.|publisher=Goodwill Trading Co.|year=2001|isbn=978-971-12-0245-3|page=97}}</ref>  He suggested that the interaction between these two domains occurs inside the brain, perhaps in a small midline structure called the [[pineal gland]].<ref name=\"Stanford_pineal\">{{cite web|title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland|publisher=Stanford University|date=November 5, 2008|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pineal-gland/|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is widely accepted that Descartes explained the problem cogently, few later philosophers have been happy with his solution, and his ideas about the pineal gland have especially been ridiculed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Descartes and the pineal gland |author=Gert-Jan Lokhorst |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N.

Proposed solutions can be divided broadly into two categories:  [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] solutions that maintain Descartes' rigid distinction between the realm of consciousness and the realm of matter but give different answers for how the two realms relate to each other; and [[monism|monist]] solutions that maintain that there is really only one realm of being, of which consciousness and matter are both aspects.  Each of these categories itself contains numerous variants.  The two main types of dualism are [[substance dualism]] (which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics) and [[property dualism]] (which holds that the laws of physics are universally valid but cannot be used to explain the mind).  The three main types of monism are [[physicalism]] (which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way), [[idealism]] (which holds that only thought or experience truly exists, and matter is merely an illusion), and [[neutral monism]] (which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them).  There are also, however, a large number of idiosyncratic theories that cannot cleanly be assigned to any of these schools of thought.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Jaworski |title=Philosophy of Mind: A Comprehensive Introduction |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4443-3367-1 |pages=5\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSince the dawn of Newtonian science with its vision of simple mechanical principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted by the idea that consciousness could be explained in purely physical terms. The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]], in his book ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''L'homme machine'').

His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are.  To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols.  In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program.  Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean.  If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve.  Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English.  Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.<ref name=Searle1990>{{cite journal|author=John R.

These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |author=Ezequiel Morsella |year=2005 |title=The function of phenomenal states: Supramodular Interaction Theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=112 |pages=1000\u20131021 |pmid=16262477 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.4.1000}}</ref> Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious.

David Chalmers has called this the [[hard problem of consciousness]].<ref name=ChalmersHardProblem /> Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities (\"[[qualia]]\") are [[ineffability|ineffable]]; that is, they are \"raw feels\", incapable of being analyzed into component processes.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=On leaving out what it's like |author=Joseph Levine |title=The Nature of Consciousness: Philosophical Debates |editor=N.

For example, research on [[ideasthesia]] shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network.

The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple types of information from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the [[thalamus]] and then to the [[primary visual cortex]]; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion.<ref name=BennettHacker>{{cite book |title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience |first=M.R. |last=Bennett |editor1=Peter Michael |editor2=Stephan Hacker |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 |pages=121\u2013147}}</ref> Memory comes into play in at least two ways.

It derives from a need to treat people whose brain function has been impaired as a result of disease, brain damage, toxins, or drugs.  In medicine, conceptual distinctions are considered useful to the degree that they can help to guide treatments.   Whereas the philosophical approach to consciousness focuses on its fundamental nature and its contents, the medical approach focuses on the amount of consciousness a person has:  in medicine, consciousness is assessed as a \"level\" ranging from coma and brain death at the low end, to full alertness and purposeful responsiveness at the high end.<ref name=Blumenfeld>{{cite book |title=The Neurology of Consciousness: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropathology |editor=Steven Laureys |editor2=Giulio Tononi |chapter=The neurological examination of consciousness |author=Hal Blumenfeld |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-374168-4}}</ref>\n\nConsciousness is of concern to patients and physicians, especially [[neurology|neurologists]] and [[anesthesia|anesthesiologists]].

The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli.  If so, the next question is whether the patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands.  If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.  A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be \"alert and oriented times four\" (sometimes denoted \"A&Ox4\" on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.<ref>{{cite book |title=Essentials of Abnormal Psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780495806134 |url-access=registration |author=V.

A formal neurological examination runs through a precisely delineated series of tests, beginning with tests for basic sensorimotor reflexes, and culminating with tests for sophisticated use of language.  The outcome may be summarized using the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], which yields a number in the range 3\u201315, with a score of 3 to 8 indicating coma, and 15 indicating full consciousness.  The Glasgow Coma Scale has three subscales, measuring the best motor response (ranging from \"no motor response\" to \"obeys commands\"), the best eye response (ranging from \"no eye opening\" to \"eyes opening spontaneously\") and the best verbal response (ranging from \"no verbal response\" to \"fully oriented\").

Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move.  When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense.  Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies:  one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him.  An even more striking type of anosognosia is [[Anton\u2013Babinski syndrome]], a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.<ref>{{cite book |editor=George Prigatano |editor2=[[Daniel Schacter]]|title=Awareness of Deficit After Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |chapter=Anosognosia: possible neuropsychological mechanisms |author=Kenneth M.

According to James, the \"stream of thought\" is governed by five characteristics:  \"(1) Every thought tends to be part of a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous.
