Mason]] to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" automakers ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]]). The merger was intended to be the first step of amalgamating the Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard marques into a single company. The plan was for Nash to acquire Hudson and for Packard to acquire Studebaker, then merge the four marques into one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/amc/|title=The Spirit Is Still Alive: American Motors Corporation 1954-1987|website=allpar.com|author=Chad Quella}}</ref> Mason had first discussed the possibility of a merger with Packard president [[James J.

Barit]] retired to become an AMC board member. Mason selected long-time Nash associate and future governor of Michigan, [[George W. Romney]] as Vice president. [[Roy Abernethy]], ex Vice president of Sales for [[Willys]], was hired to be Vice president of Sales for AMC.\n\nFollowing Mason's sudden death on October 8, 1954, Romney took over, reorganizing the company and focusing AMC's future on a new small car line.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861782,00.html|url-access=subscription|title=Gamble on the Rambler|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 19, 1955|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> Mason's death also allowed Romney to put an end to any further discussions for a merger between AMC and [[Studebaker-Packard]].\n\nBy the end of 1957, the legacy Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out, replaced with the [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] and [[Nash Metropolitan|Metropolitan]] brands. The company struggled at first, but under Abernethy, Rambler sales took off. A Rambler won the 1959 [[Mobil Economy Run]] and by 1960, was the third most popular brand of automobile in the United States, behind Ford and Chevrolet.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864627,00.html|url-access=subscription|title=Autos: Victory for Rambler|magazine=Time|date=April 20, 1959|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm|title=1965\u20131966 Rambler Ambassador|authors=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com|date=October 23, 2007|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGeorge Romney left AMC in 1962 to run for governor in Michigan and was replaced as CEO by Roy Abernethy. After two model years (1963 and 1964) of only producing compact cars, Abernethy shifted the focus of AMC back to larger and more profitable cars like the Ambassador line from the perceived negative of the Rambler's [[economy car]] image. Ambassador sales jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965. In 1966 they went to more than 71,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autos.ca/classic-cars/motoring-memories-amc-ambassador-1965-1966/|author=Bill Vance|title=Motoring Memories: AMC Ambassador, 1965-1966|publisher=Autos Canada|date=17 March 2006|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> However, the huge costs of developing the new cars and engines meant AMC now had problems in securing [[working capital]] to keep the company going.

While prices and costs were cut, new and more sporty automobiles were introduced, and from 1968 AMC became known for the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] and [[AMC AMX|AMX]] [[muscle car]]s.\n\nAMC purchased [[Kaiser Jeep|Kaiser]]'s [[Jeep]] utility vehicle operations in 1970 to complement its existing passenger car business. Beginning in the early 1970s, the company moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]], including the Hornet itself and the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]. Other new models in the 1970s included the [[AMC Matador|Matador]] and [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]]. Sagging sales and tight finances resulted in the elimination of the Matador line in the 1979 model year and the Pacer line in 1980, leaving AMC to focus almost exclusively on its Hornet [[automobile platform|platform]] based cars and the Jeep line. Hornet derivatives of the late 1970s included the [[AMC Spirit|Spirit]] and [[AMC Concord|Concord]], while the innovative 4-wheel-drive [[AMC Eagle]] introduced in 1979 was one of the first true [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]].\n\nFrom 1980, AMC partnered with France's [[Renault]] to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. By 1983 Renault had a controlling interest in AMC. After the 1983 model year, the AMC brand focused entirely on [[all wheel drive|AWD]] autos; the company stopped producing two-wheel drive cars. AMC facilities were used to produce the Renault-branded Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars. In 1985 Chrysler entered an agreement with AMC to produce Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Furys as well as Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in AMC's [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], plant. At the time, AMC had excess manufacturing capacity, thus contract manufacturing for Chrysler made sense. In 1987, after further new vehicle development that included the [[Eagle Medallion|Medallion]] (a re-badged [[Renault 21]]) and [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]'s Italdesign new [[full-size car|full-size]] [[front-wheel drive|front-drive]] sedan that became the [[Eagle Premier]],<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Jim Dunne|title=Inside Detroit|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=June 1986|volume=163|issue=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42|page=42|accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Business Week|date=April 28, 1986|title=Can American Motors shed its sad-sack image?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUw1AAAAMAAJ&q=A+two-+door+coupe,+the+X-59,+debuts+in+1988|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref> Renault sold its 47% ownership stake in AMC to [[Chrysler]]. Chrysler made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of AMC stock on the NYSE. Renault left the US market completely as a brand in 1987. The Renault Medallion was sold through the newly formed Jeep Eagle Division of Chrysler as an Eagle, not a Renault. AMC's badge would be used on the Eagle Sports Wagon through the 1988 model year, then be eliminated entirely. The [[Jeep-Eagle|Jeep/Eagle]] division of Chrysler Corporation was formed from the AMC Jeep Renault dealer network. The [[Jeep]] and [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] vehicles were marketed primarily by former AMC [[Car dealership|dealers]]. Ultimately, the Eagle Brand of car would be phased out like Chrysler's [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], Plymouth, and Imperial by 1998.\n\n== 1954 creation ==\n\nIn January 1954, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation began acquisition of the Hudson Motor Car Company (in what was called a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]]). The new corporation would be called American Motors Corporation. (An earlier corporation with the same name, co-founded by [[Louis Chevrolet]], had existed in New Jersey from 1916 through 1922 before merging into the Bessemer\u2013American Motors Corporation.)\n\nThe Nash-Kelvinator/Hudson deal was a straight [[stock transfer agent|stock transfer]] (three shares of Hudson listed at 11\u215b, for two shares of AMC and one share of Nash-Kelvinator listed at 17\u215c, for one share of AMC) and finalized in the spring of 1954, forming the fourth-biggest auto company in the U.S. with [[asset]]s of US$355&nbsp;million and more than $100&nbsp;million in [[working capital]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823270,00.html|url-access=subscription|title=Answer from the Hustlers|magazine=Time|date=January 25, 1954|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> The new company retained Hudson CEO [[A.E.

The separate Nash and Hudson dealer networks were retained. The Hudsons were redesigned to bring them in harmony with Nash body styles.\n\nThe fast-selling Rambler model was sold as both a Nash and a Hudson in 1955 and 1956. These [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] Ramblers, along with similar Metropolitans, were identical save for hubcaps, nameplates, and other minor trim details.\n\nThe pre-existing full-size Nash product line was continued and the [[Nash Statesman]] and Ambassador were restyled as the \"new\" [[Hudson Wasp]] and [[Hudson Hornet]]. Although the cars shared the same body shell, they were at least as different from one another as Chevrolet and Pontiac. Hudsons and Nashes each used their own engines as they had previously: the Hudson Hornet continued to offer the {{convert|308|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 that had powered the ([[NASCAR]]) champion during the early 1950s; the Wasp now used the former engine of the Hudson Jet.\n\nThe Nash Ambassador and Statesman continued with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, dash panels and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy owing to the lighter unitized Nash body.\n\nFor the 1958 model year, the Nash and Hudson brands were dropped. [[Rambler (car)|Rambler]] became a marque in its own right and the mainstay of the company. The popular British-built Metropolitan subcompact continued as a standalone brand until it was discontinued in 1961. The prototype 1958 [[Nash Ambassador]] / [[Hudson Hornet]], built on a stretched Rambler platform, was renamed at the last minute as \"Ambassador by Rambler\". To round out the model line AMC reintroduced the old 1955, {{convert|100|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase [[Nash Rambler]] as the new [[Rambler American]] with only a few modifications. This gave Rambler a compact lineup with {{convert|100|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} American, {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], as well as the {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Ambassador wheelbase vehicles.\n\n=== The \"dinosaur-fighter\" ===\nSales of Ramblers soared in the late 1950s in part because of American Motors' focus on the compact car and its marketing efforts. These included sponsoring the hugely popular [[Walt Disney anthology television series]] and as an exhibitor at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. George Romney himself pitched the Rambler product in the television commercials.\n\nWhile the \"Big Three\" introduced ever-larger cars, AMC followed a \"dinosaur-fighter\" strategy. [[George W. Romney]]'s leadership focused the company on the compact car, a fuel-efficient vehicle 20 years before there was a real need for them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gerald C.

Two core [[Critical success factor|strategic factors]] came into play: (1) the use of shared components in AMC products and (2) a refusal to participate in the Big Three's restyling race.

Innovative marketing ideas included making [[air conditioning]] standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a delete option). This made AMC the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]], and [[Cadillac]].\n\nThe company introduced exciting entries for the decade's [[muscle car]] boom, most notably the [[AMC AMX|AMX]], while the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] served as the company's entrant into the sporty \"pony car\" market created by the [[Ford Mustang]]. Additional operating cash was derived in 1968 through the sale of [[Kelvinator]] Appliance, once one of the firm's core operating units. The Kelvinator divestiture left AMC a downsized company solely manufacturing automobiles.\n\nThe Rambler brand was completely dropped after the 1969 model year in North America, although it continued to be used in several overseas markets as either a model or brand name, with the last use in [[Mexico]] in 1983. From 1970, AMC was the brand used for all American Motors passenger cars; and all vehicles from that date bore the AMC name and the new corporate logo. However, the names American Motors and AMC were used interchangeably in corporate literature well into the 1980s. The branding issue was further complicated when the company's [[AMC Eagle|Eagle]] [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] passenger cars were marketed as the American Eagle in the 1980s.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== 1970s product developments ==\n[[File:1972 AMC Gremlin X green 5-litre V8 Nashville.jpg|thumb|1972 Gremlin X]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop (26912016752).jpg|thumb|right|1971 Ambassador hardtop with \"Brougham\" trim]]\n[[File:1975 AMC Matador base sedan in Fawn Beige 03.jpg|thumb|right|1975 Matador sedan]]\n[[File:Portland AM General bus in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|AM General transit bus]]\n[[File:Matador1.JPG|thumb|right|1974 Matador X Coupe]]\n[[File:1975 AMC Pacer base model frontrightside.jpg|thumb|right|1975 AMC Pacer]]\n[[File:1976 AMC Hornet Sportabout.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Hornet Sportabout]]\n[[File:Jeep Cherokee SJ Chief S f.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee (SJ) Chief S]]\n[[File:1979 AMC Spirit GT V8 Russet FR.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Spirit GT]]\n\n'''Jeep'''\n\nIn the late 1960s [[Kaiser Jeep]] Corporation (formerly [[Willys]]-Overland) decided to leave the automotive industry and sought a buyer for its money-losing [[Jeep]] division. AMC's Vice President for Manufacturing, [[Gerald C. Meyers]] headed the team sent to evaluate Kaiser's Jeep factories. Although opposed by AMC top management, Chapin made a major decision in February 1970 to purchase Kaiser's Jeep operations for $70 million. Although it was a gamble Chapin believed that Jeep vehicles would complement AMC's passenger car business. The Jeep market was also a market in which the Big Three had no presence, and therefore there was no competition. AMC gained the iconic Jeep brand of light trucks and SUVs, as well as Kaiser-Jeep's government contracts \u2013 notably the [[M151]] line of military Jeeps and the [[Jeep DJ|DJ-Series]] [[United States Postal Service|postal]] Jeeps. AMC also expanded their international network. The military and special products business was reconstituted as American Motors General Products Division, later reorganized as [[AM General]].\n\n'''Hornet and Gremlin'''\n\nIn 1970, AMC consolidated all passenger cars under one distinct brand identity and debuted the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]] range of compact cars. The Hornet and the later [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]] shared [[Automobile platform|platforms]]. The Gremlin, the first North American-built subcompact, sold more than 670,000 units from 1970 to 1978. The Hornet became AMC's best-selling passenger car since the Rambler Classic, with more than 860,000 units sold by the time production ended in 1977. The Hornet platform continued to be built under a variety of models through 1987.\n\nFor a time, both the Hornet and Gremlin could be ordered with [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] denim interiors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/these-vintage-hornets-prove-even-cars-were-hit-by-the-blue-jeans-craze-of-the-1970s|title=Even AMC cars were hit by the blue jeans craze of the 1970s|last=|first=|date=|website=ME-TV Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Matador'''\n\nThe new facelifted, mid-sized [[AMC Matador]] replaced the Rebel in 1971, using an advertising campaign that asked, \"What's a Matador?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.javelinamx.com/JavHome/articles/matx-rt.htm|title=Road Test: American Motors Matador X from ''Road & Track''|date=March 1974|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184149/http://www.javelinamx.com/JavHome/articles/matx-rt.htm|archivedate=May 11, 2008|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}</ref> In 1972, AMC won the tender for [[Los Angeles Police Department]] cruisers, and Matadors were used by the department from 1972 to 1975, replacing the [[Plymouth Satellite]]. American Motors supplied [[Mark VII Limited]] owner [[Jack Webb]] with two Matadors, a sedan and a wagon, for use in his popular television series ''[[Adam-12]]'', increasing the cars' public profile.\n\nIn 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with [[Curtiss-Wright]] to build [[Wankel engine]]s for cars and Jeeps.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_15/|author=Ward's Auto World Staff|title=Rearview mirror|magazine=Ward's Auto World|date=February 1, 2000|accessdate=August 31, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105205047/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_15/|archivedate=November 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1974, the Matador sedan and station wagon were mildly refreshed, with new boxier front and rear ends.

The additional length was due to a new front end design and stronger energy-absorbing bumpers required of all automobiles sold in the U.S.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Jan P.

The full-sized Ambassador was discontinued as AMC's flagship line after the 1974 model year, leaving only the Matador as AMC's full-size offering. Nash and AMC made Ambassadors from 1927 to 1974, the longest use of the same model name for any AMC product and, at the time, the longest continuously used nameplate in the industry.\n\n'''Metropolitan Buses'''\n\nIn 1974, AMC's AM General subsidiary began building urban transit buses in cooperation with [[New Flyer Industries|Flyer Industries]] of [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. The ''Metropolitan'' coach had sold 5,212 units when production ceased in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omot.org/roster/buses/amg.html|title=Coach Manufacturer History \u2013 AM General|publisher=Ohio Museum of Transportation|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''Pacer'''\n\nThe [[AMC Pacer]], an innovative all-new model introduced in March 1975 and marketed as \"the first wide small car\", was a subcompact designed to provide the comfort of a full-sized car. Its pre-production development coincided tightened U.S. Federal passenger [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] and [[Car safety|auto safety]] regulations.\n\nWith the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of 1973, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] aborted the [[Wankel rotary engine]] around which the Pacer had been designed, as its fuel consumption exceeded that of conventional engines with similar power. Therefore, AMC's existing {{convert|258|and|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine]]s were used in the Pacer instead. Fuel economy was better than a rotary but still relatively poor in light of the new focus on energy efficiency. Also, as the Pacer shared few components other than drivetrain with other AMC cars, it was expensive to make and the cost increased when sales fell steeply after the first two years.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nDevelopment and production costs for the Pacer and Matador Coupe drained capital which might otherwise have been invested in updating the more popular Hornet and Gremlin lines so that toward the end of the 1970s the company faced the growing energy crisis with aged products that were uncompetitive in hotly contested markets. However, \"AMC used cars, as far back as 1967, had the advantage of good warranty coverage \u2026 so most owners were conscious of low-cost car maintenance \u2026 AMC units [became] some of the very best buys on the used car market\" by 1975.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Buying a Used Car|magazine=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|date=January 1975|volume=29|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27|accessdate=January 16, 2011|page=27|authors=Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc}}</ref>\n\nThe 1977 Gremlin had redesigned headlights, grille, rear hatch and fascia. For economy in the fuel crisis, AMC offered the car with a more fuel-efficient [[Volkswagen]]-designed [[Audi]] 4-cylinder engine {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was expensive for AMC to build and the Gremlin retained the less costly but also less economical {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} as standard equipment.\n\nThe [[AMC AMX|AMX]] nameplate was revived in 1977.

Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with opera windows, and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.\n\n'''Concord'''\n\nFor 1978, the Hornet [[automobile platform|platform]] was redesigned with an adaptation of the new Gremlin front-end design and renamed [[AMC Concord]]. AMC targeted it at the emerging \"premium compact\" market segment, paying particular attention to ride and handling, standard equipment, trim, and interior luxury.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Rich Ceppos|title=AMC for '78 \u2013 a V-8 for the Pacer, and now there's Concord|magazine=Popular Science|page=98|date=October 1977|volume=211|issue=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA98|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGremlins borrowed the Concord instrument panel, as well as a Hornet AMX-inspired GT sports appearance package and a new striping treatment for X models.\n\nThe AMC Pacer hood was modified to clear a V8 engine, and a Sports package replaced the former X package. With falling sales of Matador Coupes, sedans and wagons, their {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was dropped, leaving only the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Inline-6 (standard on coupes and sedans) and the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (optional on coupes and sedans, standard on wagons). The two-tone Barcelona luxury package was offered on Matador sedans, and two-tone red paint introduced as an additional Barcelona option. Matador production ceased at the end of the model year with total sales of 10,576 units. The Matador was no longer attractive as automakers struggled to overcome economic woes including continuing fuel price increases and double-digit domestic inflation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas J.

This development effectively ended AMC's run as a truly American car company.\n\nNew ownership and new management heralded a new product venture for AMC: a line of modern [[front-wheel drive]] cars, designed by Renault, to be produced at Kenosha.\n\n== 1980s product developments ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== AMC Eagle ===\n[[File:AMC Eagle wagon.jpg|right|thumb|1981 AMC Eagle Wagon.]]\nIn August 1979, for the 1980 model year, AMC introduced four-wheel drive versions of the [[AMC Spirit|Spirit]] and [[AMC Concord|Concord]], calling the collective line the [[AMC Eagle]]. Eagles rapidly became one of the company's best-known products and is considered one of the first \"[[crossover SUV]]s\".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Eagles used the 2-wheel drive body shells mounted on an all-new platform developed by American Motors in the late 1970s. Featuring an innovative full-time four-wheel drive system, it sold best in snow-prone areas. Sales started strongly but declined over time. While the two-wheel drive Spirit and Concord were both discontinued after 1983 as the company concentrated on its new [[Renault Alliance]], the Eagle survived for five years longer, albeit only in station wagon form, into the 1988 model year. This meant the four-wheel drive Eagle was the lone representative of the AMC brand from 1984 to 1988. All the company's remaining output was branded Renault or Jeep. The last AMC Eagle was built on December 14, 1987.\n\n=== Renault Alliance, Encore & GTA ===\n[[File:Alliance retrav.jpg|thumb|right|The Renault Alliance, based on the Renault 9, was built by American Motors Corporation from 1983 to 1987]]\nThe Renault Alliance was the first joint product of the AMC-Renault partnership. Introduced in 1983, the Alliance was a front-wheel drive [[Renault 9]] compact car slightly restyled for the American market by [[Richard Teague]] mostly to comply with American safety standards and produced by AMC at Kenosha. The car was badged as a Renault and some cars also carried AMC badges. It was available as a sedan with two or four doors and later as a convertible. The [[hatchback]], introduced in 1984 and badged as the [[Renault Encore]], was basically the same as the European Renault 11 model. For the final 1987 model year, a higher-performance version of the Alliance 2 door sedan and convertible was sold as the Renault GTA.<ref>[https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2015/09/29/the-one-to-watch-1987-renault-gta-brochure/ The One To Watch: 1987 Renault GTA brochure, www.hemmings.com] Retrieved 24 April 2018</ref> This version had a Renault two liter engine that was exclusive to it and not shared with the European Renault 9 and 11 models.\n\nThe new model, introduced at a time of increased interest in small cars, won several awards including [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]]. ''Motor Trend'' declared: \"The Alliance may well be the best-assembled first-year car we\u2019ve ever seen. Way to go Renault!\" The Alliance was listed as number one on ''[[Car and Driver]]'s'' list of [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best cars]] for 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=1983 10 Best Cars: AMC/Renault Alliance \u2013 An Alliance Builds an Alliance|magazine=Car and Driver|date=January 1983|volume=28|issue=7|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/archive/1983_10best_cars-10best_cars/an_alliance_builds_an_alliance_page_2|accessdate=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917091637/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/archive/1983_10best_cars-10best_cars/an_alliance_builds_an_alliance_page_2|archivedate=September 17, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The positive reception and sales of 200,000 Alliances by 1984 was hindered by the availability of only two body styles. The Alliance was a European-designed car and not fully suited to U.S. market demands. The distribution network was also not well supported, which led to lower quality delivered by dealerships with \"disastrous consequences\" for the image of the automobiles, as well as high warranty costs because of quality failings which greatly impacted sales from 1985 to the end of production in 1987.<ref name=\"foreign\">{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Lina G\u00e1lvez-Mu\u00f1oz|title=Foreign multinationals in the United States: management and performance|chapter=6|year=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-25055-9|pages=110\u2013112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AnsvkPyJPiAC&pg=PA110&dq=Renault+Alliance|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Encore models were renamed Alliance Hatchback in 1987. Alliance and GTA production ended in June of that year while the Renault 9 and 11 models continued through the 1988 model year in Europe, being replaced by the all new Renault 19.\n\n=== Jeeps ===\n[[File:Jeep Cherokee XJ 4D Laredo burgundy SOP rr.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee Laredo]]\n[[File:Jeep Comanche Pioneer white MD r.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Comanche Pioneer]]\nMore beneficial to AMC's future was the introduction of an all-new line of compact [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] and [[Jeep Wagoneer|Wagoneer]] models in the autumn of 1983 for the 1984 model year. The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV). They initially used the AMC 150 C.I.D. (2.5L) [[AMC Straight-4 engine|OHV four-cylinder engine]] with a [[carburetor]], and a General Motors-built {{convert|2.8|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5&nbsp;L I4 engines. A Renault {{convert|2.1|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} Turbo-Diesel I4 [[Diesel engine|diesel]] was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a {{convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} I6 engine, derived from the older {{convert|258|CID|L|abbr=on}} I6 with a new head design and an electronic [[fuel injection]] system, replaced the [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] V6. American Motors' \"new\" engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix ([[Renix]]) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design continued to be improved and refined until its discontinuation at the end of the 2006 model year. The 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding {{convert|300000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The XJ Cherokee itself was built by Chrysler until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China.\n\nThree other designs continued to be used after the Chrysler buyout: the Grand Wagoneer full-size luxury SUV, the full-sized J-series pickups, built on the same chassis as the earlier SJ model Wagoneers and Cherokees that dated from 1963 with the AMC {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and the [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ) compact pickup, which debuted in 1986. Unlike most sport-utility vehicles which are based on adapted pickup truck designs, the Cherokee XJ SUV came first and the Comanche was designed as a later pickup truck version.\n\nProduction of the full-sized pickups ceased after 1987. The Grand Wagoneer and 360 V8 engine were dropped after 1991 (the last American-made vehicle whose engine used a [[carburetor]] for fuel delivery), and the Comanche bowed after 1992.\n\n== 1985 and the final buyout ==\n\n=== Marketplace and management changes ===\nThere were significant changes in 1985 as the market moved away from AMC's small models. With fuel relatively cheap again, buyers turned to larger more powerful automobiles and AMC was unprepared for this development. Even the venerable Jeep CJ-5 was dropped after a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' TV news magazine expos\u00e9 of rollover tendencies under extreme conditions. AMC also confronted an angry workforce. Labor was taking revenge, and reports circulated about sabotage of vehicles on the assembly lines because of the failure to receive promised wage increases{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}. There were rumors that the aging Kenosha plant was to be shut down. At the same time, Chrysler was having trouble meeting the demand for its M-body rear-drive models ([[Dodge Diplomat]], [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]]). Because they were assembled using the old \"gate and buck system\" and the tooling could be easily moved, Chrysler could supply the components and control the quality, while AMC assembled the car. Therefore, Lee Iacocca and Joe Cappy reached an agreement to use some of AMC's idle plant capacity in Kenosha.<ref name=sharf>{{cite magazine|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_lee_iacocca_knew/index.html|author=Stephan Sharf|title=Lee Iacocca as I knew him; he was certainly the right man at the right time..|magazine=Ward's AutoWorld|date=May 1, 1996|accessdate=August 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081658/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_lee_iacocca_knew/index.html|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese problems came in the midst of a transfer of power at AMC from Paul Tippet to a French executive, Pierre Semerena. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care [[Wheel Horse]] Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People's Republic of China. [[The Pentagon]] had problems with [[AM General]], a significant [[defense contractor]], being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a significant portion of an important defense supplier.<ref>{{cite book |author=Byron Olsen|author2=Barney Olsen|author3=Joseph Cabadas|title=The American Auto Factory|year=2002|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-1059-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iZJzb91qsE4C&pg=PA127|accessdate=November 24, 2010|page=127}}</ref> As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold. Another milestone was the departure of [[Richard A. Teague|Dick Teague]]: AMC's design vice president for 26 years, he was responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs including the Rambler American, Javelin, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, and Matador coupe.\n\n=== Problems at Renault and assassination ===\nAmerican Motors' major stockholder, Renault, was itself experiencing financial trouble in France. The investment in AMC (including the construction of a new Canadian assembly plant in [[Brampton]], Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass [[layoff]]s. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare AMC officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) They could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived AMC as a bottomless pit; or (3) AMC could be put up for sale and the French could get back part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, [[Georges Besse]], continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as [[Brampton Assembly|Bramalea Assembly]], as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0&nbsp;L and 2.5&nbsp;L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that AMC was on course for profitability.\n\nHowever, on November 17, 1986, [[Georges Besse]], who had a high-profile among French capitalists, was assassinated by a member of a militant extremist group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164838/Direct-Action|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Direct Action|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Chrysler purchases AMC Stock ===\nUnder pressure from Renault executives following Besse's death, Renault's new president, Raymond Levy set out to repair employee relations and [[Divestment|divest]] the company of its investment in American Motors.

According to the head of manufacturing for Chrysler at the time, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with AMC producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations.<ref name=sharf/>\n\n[[File:1st Jeep Grand Cherokee .jpg|thumb|The [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was the driving force behind Chrysler's buyout of AMC; Lee Iacocca wanted the design.

It was the Jeep brand that Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] really wanted \u2013 in particular the ZJ [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]], then under development by Jeep engineers, which ultimately proved highly profitable for Chrysler (the nameplate remains in production today). However, the buyout included other attractive deal sweeteners for Chrysler. Among them was the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in [[Bramalea, Ontario]], which offered Iacocca an unprecedented opportunity to increase his company's [[Capacity utilization|production capacity]] at a fire-sale price. AMC had designed and built the plant in anticipation of building the [[Renault 25]] based [[Eagle Premier]]. Additional profitable acquisitions were the AMC dealer network (the addition of which strengthened Chrysler's retail distribution \u2013 many AMC dealers switched to selling Chrysler products); and AMC's underrated organization and management talent \u2013 which Chrysler quickly assimilated (numerous leading Chrysler engineers and executives were ex-AMC).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html|title=DaimlerChrysler: The 'What Ifs?'|magazine=Ward's AutoWorld|4=|date=June 1, 1998|accessdate=August 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081757/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> AMC was renamed Jeep Eagle Corporation (a Chrysler subsidiary) August 25, 1988, and was fully merged as of March 29, 1990.<ref name=cofs.lara.state.mi.us/>\n\nThe sale came at a time when the automotive press was enthusiastic about the proposed 1988 lineup of Renault, Eagle and Jeep vehicles, and reports that the financial outlook for the tiny automaker was improving.

The lessons learned from this experience were integrated into the company that bought AMC. The organization, strategies, as well as several key executives,  allowed Chrysler to gain an edge on the competition. Even today, the lessons gained from the AMC experience continue to provide benefits to other firms in the industry. There are a number of legacies from AMC's [[Strategic management|business strategies]].\n\nAMC had an ability to formulate strategies that were often evaluated by industry critics as \"strokes of brilliance\".<ref name=Higgins>{{cite news|author=James V. Higgins|title=Roy Chapin Jr. mastered how to survive in auto industry|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=August 12, 2001}}</ref> According to [[Roy D.

This approach was finally accepted within the U.S. [[auto industry]], but only after each of the Big Three experienced the failure of attempting to be self-sufficient.\n\nThe smallest domestic automaker did not have \"the massive R&D budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors \u2026 [thus] AMC placed R&D emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps).\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpAoAQAAMAAJ&q=AMC|title=R&D Decision Area|author1=John A.

AMC was also effective in other areas such as marketing by introducing low rate financing. AMC's four-wheel drive vehicles established the foundation for the modern SUV market segments, and \"classic\" Jeep models continue to be the benchmark in this field. Roy D. Chapin drew on his experiences as a hunter and fisherman and marketed the Jeep brand successfully to people with like interests. The brand developed a cult appeal that continues.<ref name=Fracassa>{{cite news|author=Hawke Fracassa|title=Roy D. Chapin Jr., ex-AMC chairman gambled to save Jeep|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=August 7, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe purchase of AMC was instrumental in reviving Chrysler. According to [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]], former President of Chrysler, the AMC acquisition was a big and risky undertaking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lutz|first=Robert A.|year=1999|title=Guts: The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler the World's Hottest Car Company|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-35765-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gutssevenlawsofb00lutz}}</ref> The purchase was part of Chrysler's strategic \"retreat-cum-diversification\" plan that he states did not have the right focus. Initially, the goal was to obtain the world-renowned Jeep brand. However, Lutz discovered that the decision to buy AMC turned out to be a gold mine for Chrysler.<ref>Lutz, p. 16.</ref> At that time, Chrysler's management was attempting to find a model to improve structure and operations, ''\"something that would help get our minds unstuck and thinking beyond the old paradigms that we were so familiar with''\".<ref name=\"lutz-31\">Lutz, p. 31.</ref> In this transformation, ''\"Chrysler's acquisition of AMC was one of the all-time great moments in corporate serendipity''\" according to Lutz ''\"that most definitely played a key role in demonstrating how to accomplish change''\".<ref name=\"lutz-31\"/>\n\nAccording to Lutz (1993), while AMC had its share of problems, it was far from being a bunch of \"brain-dead losers\". He describes the \"troops\" at AMC as more like the [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island Marines]] in battle, \"with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products\".<ref name=\"lutz-33\">Lutz, p. 33.</ref> After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by AMC, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former AMC units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, AMC's lead engineer, [[Fran\u00e7ois Castaing]], was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place, AMC's \"[[Automobile platform|platform team]]\" was implemented. These were close-knit cross-functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as \"the engineering company\" was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action was going to change that.<ref name=\"lutz-33\"/> In summary, Chrysler's purchase of AMC laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.\n\nTop managers at Chrysler after the AMC buyout appeared to have made errors similar to those by AMC. For example, Chrysler invested heavily in new untested models while not keeping up its profitable high-volume lines.\n\nThe AMC influence also continued at [[General Motors]]. GM recruited a new executive team to turn itself from near bankruptcy in the early 2000s. Among the new strategists at GM was Lutz who brought an understanding of the importance of passion in the product design. Lutz implemented a new thinking at GM that incorporated the systems and structures that originated from AMC's lean and focused operations.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Alex Taylor III|title=Finally GM is looking good|magazine=Fortune|volume=145|issue=7|date=April 1, 2002|pages=69\u201374|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/04/01/320620/index.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRenault implemented the lessons it learned from its investment in AMC.

The deal was immediately compared to the AMC-Renault deal; some commentators noted the irony in that Chrysler now faced the same fate that AMC faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there were key differences between the two:\n*Fiat CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] became CEO of Chrysler as part of the deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler's assets and product lines;\n*the Fiat-Chrysler merger did not face the political opposition the AMC-Renault deal did since Fiat is led by a family group with significant equity and the US government supported the merger;\n*while AMC proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and has since become an important source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the [[European debt crisis]].\n\nThe two firms would later fully merge to create [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]]|location=London, UK|title=Fiat says merger into Dutch-registered FCA effective October 12|date=7 October 2014|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/07/us-fiat-spa-chrysler-idUSKCN0HW0CZ20141007}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy of products ==\n\n=== Passenger automobiles ===\n[[File:Eagle Premier.jpg|thumb|right|Eagle Premier]]\nChrysler revived the \"Spirit\" name dropped by AMC after 1983 for use on one of its [[Chrysler A platform|A platform]] cars, (the [[Dodge Spirit]]) from 1989 to 1995. The planned [[Renault Medallion]] was sold as the [[Eagle Medallion]] in 1988 and 1989. The planned all-new 1988 Renault Premier, a joint development effort between American Motors and Renault, and for which the [[Brampton Assembly]] plant ([[Brampton]], Ontario\u2014originally called the Bramalea Plant) was built, was sold by Chrysler as the 1988\u20131992 [[Eagle Premier]], with a rebadged [[Dodge Monaco]] variant available from 1990 to 1992. The [[Full-size car|full-sized]] Premier's platform was far more advanced than anything Chrysler was building at the time. After some re-engineering and a re-designation to Chrysler [[Chrysler LH platform|code LH]], the Eagle Premier went on to form the backbone of Chrysler's passenger car lineup during the 1990s as the [[Chrysler Concorde]] (a revived model name that was briefly used by [[Plymouth Concord|Plymouth]] in 1951 and 1952), [[Chrysler New Yorker]], [[Chrysler LHS]], [[Dodge Intrepid]], and [[Eagle Vision]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=John A. Hailig|title=To the Edge and Back: Re-Emergence in the Eighties|magazine=Automobile Quarterly|volume=32|issue=4|page=104}}</ref> Plymouth almost received their own rendition of the LH platform, which was to be called the Accolade, but Chrysler decided to nix this idea not long before LH production started. The [[Chrysler 300M]] was likewise a Premier/LH-derived car and was initially to have been the next-generation Eagle Vision, until the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand was dropped after 1998. The LH Platform was subsequently re-engineered, using [[Mercedes-Benz]] components, into the [[Chrysler LX Platform]] which remains in production today underpinning the [[Chrysler 300]], [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] and [[Dodge Challenger]].\n\n=== Jeep vehicles ===\n[[File:Jeep Comanche Chief.jpg|thumb|Jeep Comanche]]\nChrysler marketed the SJ [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]] until 1991, leaving it almost entirely unaltered from the final AMC rendition before the buyout. The [[Jeep Comanche]] pickup truck remained until 1992, while the Cherokee remained until 2001 in the U.S. (the XJ Cherokee was produced in China through 2006 as the Cherokee 2500<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007112_737100.htm|last=Dunne|first=Timothy|title=Can Chrysler Rebound in China?|magazine=Business Week|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105074509/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007112_737100.htm|archivedate=November 5, 2007}}</ref> [2.5L] and Cherokee 4000 [4.0L]). Although it was not introduced until 1993, the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was initially an AMC-developed vehicle.\n\nTraces of AMC remained within. AMC's Toledo, Ohio, plants continued to manufacture the Jeep Wrangler and [[Jeep Liberty|Liberty]], as well as parts and components for Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles (although Toledo Machining and Forge was closed in 2005). AMC's main plant in Wisconsin, albeit heavily downsized, operated as the [[Kenosha Engine]] Plant, producing engines for several Chrysler Group products including the Wrangler. The plant was closed as part of the post-bailout restructuring of Chrysler in October 2010. The {{convert|242|cuin|L|1|order=flip}} engine was used until the 2006 model year by [[DaimlerChrysler]] in the [[Jeep Wrangler]]. AMC's technologically advanced Bramalea Assembly and Stamping Plants in [[Brampton]], Ontario, later produced the [[Chrysler LX platform|LX-cars]] \u2013 the [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] and the [[Chrysler 300]], and the now discontinued [[Dodge Magnum]].\n\nIn terms of AMC-related parts, some were used as late as 2006, when the [[Jeep Wrangler]] (the last new product introduced by AMC before the Chrysler deal) was still using the [[AMC Straight-6 engine]] in some models, as well as the recessed \"paddle\" door handles that were used since the 1968 model year by AMC. Both were retired when the Wrangler was completely redesigned for the 2007 model year.\n\n[[AM General]], sold by American Motors in 1982, is still in business building the American Motors-designed [[Humvee]] for American and allied militaries. AM General also built the now-discontinued civilian variant \u2013 the H1 \u2013 and manufactured a [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]-derived companion, the H2, under contract to GM, who acquired the rights to the civilian Hummer brand in 1999. GM was forced to phase out the Hummer brand in early 2010 as a part of its bankruptcy restructuring after offering it for sale, but failing to find a suitable buyer.\n\nAlthough Chrysler introduced new logos for its brands in the 1990s and again in 2010 after the [[Fiat]] Group took control of the company, Jeep still uses the AMC-era logo introduced shortly after AMC's purchase of the brand in 1970. Until the Chrysler purchase, Jeep's logo also featured the AMC emblem.\n\n== International legacy ==\n\nBeginning in 1960, AMC's executive vice president of international operations Roy D. Chapin Jr., embarked on a strong international campaign to set up importation and local assembly operations of AMC vehicles around the world.\n\nOver the next few years, Chapin was successful in establishing or re-establishing vehicle assembly operations in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]] (via Renault of France), [[Costa Rica]], [[Germany]], [[Iran]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Venezuela]]. He also strengthened import operations into the [[United Kingdom]], which had already a long history of importing and assembling Hudson and Essex/[[Terraplane]] motor vehicles prior to the merger. The Rambler Classic would even become the basis of Argentina's future national car, the [[IKA-Renault Torino|Torino]]. With AMC's acquisition of Jeep in 1970, AMC inherited all existing international Jeep operations which helped sustain AMC during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nWhile the Rambler marque had been dropped in the United States after 1967, all export markets retained the Rambler name, with the longest to retain it being Mexico up until 1983.\n\n'''Argentina'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Ambassador, Classic'' (from 1964), ''Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Ambassador, Classic'' (1962-1963)<ref>http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm</ref>\n\n'''Australia'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Ambassador'' (1961-1963), ''Classic, American, Rebel'' (sedan and wagon), ''Matador'' (sedan and wagon), ''Javelin, AMX'' (1969 model only), ''Hornet'' (sedan), ''Matador Coupe X, Jeep'' (1980-1984.)<ref>https://cj3b.info/World/AustraliaHistory.html</ref> \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Classic'' (hardtop), ''Ambassador'' (1970 only.)\n\n'''Canada'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six'' (1957 only), ''Classic, American, Ambassador, Rebel, Hornet, Gremlin, Concord, Jeep, Eagle, Spirit.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Metropolitan'' (from U.K), ''Matador, Javelin, AMX.''\n\n'''Costa Rica'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Classic'' (from 1965), ''American'' (from 1965), ''Ambassador'' (from 1965), ''Rebel, Matador, Javelin, Hornet, Sportabout, Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Ambassador'' (until 1965), ''Classic'' (until 1965), ''American'' (until 1965.)\n\n'''France''' (Belgium)\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Classic, Rebel'' (1967 only.)\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Pacer.''\n\n'''Germany'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Javelin.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''Iran'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''American, Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''Mexico'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Ambassador'' (1959 only), ''American, Classic, Rebel'' (sedan), ''Matador, Javelin, AMX, Hornet, Matador Coupe X, Gremlin, Pacer, Spirit, Jeep.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six'' (1957-1958), ''Rambler V8'' (1957-1958.)\n\n'''New Zealand'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Classic, Rebel'' (sedan), ''Jeep.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Metropolitan, Rebel'' (wagon), ''Rebel'' (hardtop), ''Ambassador'' (1970 only.)\n\n'''Philippines'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Classic, American, Javelin.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''South Africa'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''American, Hornet\u2019\u2019<ref>http://motor-assemblies.blogspot.com/2012/01/motor-assemblies-limited.html?m=1#appendixb</ref>\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''Venezuela'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Javelin, Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''United Kingdom'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Metropolitan'' (by Austin.)\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Classic, Rebel, Ambassador, Matador, Javelin, Pacer'' (locally converted to RHD), ''Gremlin'' (locally converted to RHD.)\n\n== Legacy of divisions and facilities ==\n\n=== Former divisions ===\nDuring its history, American Motors bought or created, then later sold and divested itself of several specialized divisions, some which continue to exist today:\n\n''[[Kelvinator]]'', the subdivision of Nash-Kelvinator, was sold by American Motors in 1968 to [[White Sewing Machine Company|White Consolidated Industries]] and subsequently became part of [[Electrolux]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.chhistory.org/FeatureStories.php?Story=KelvinHome |last=Hubbert |first=Christopher J. |title=The Kelvin Home: Cleveland Heights Leads the Way to: 'a New and Better Way of Living |publisher=Cleveland Heights Historical Society |year=2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref> The Kelvinator Company is still in business.\n\n''[[Jeep]]'' is now a brand of the [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].

In 1975, AMC moved its headquarters from the facility on Plymouth Road to a newly constructed building on Northwestern Highway in Southfield, Michigan, known as the [[American Center]].\n\nThe initial building had been built in 1926\u201327 by the Electric Refrigeration Corporation (subsequently [[Nash-Kelvinator]]) with design by Amedeo Leoni, industrial layout by Wallace McKenzie, and tower enclosure and industrial units by William E. Kapp, of SHG. The original {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} three-story factory and four-story administration building had been headquarters to Nash-Kelvinator from 1937 to 1954 as well as a factory for refrigerators, electric ranges, and commercial refrigeration\u2014as well as airplane propellers for the U.S. military effort during World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, the U.S. [[United States Department of War|War Department]] contracted with Nash-Kelvinator to produce 900 [[Sikorsky R-6]] model [[helicopters]]. As part of that contract, a {{convert|4.5|acre|abbr=on}} site north of the factory was used as the smallest airport in the world{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as a [[flight testing]] base. Nash-Kelvinator produced about fifty R-6s a month during the war. When the contract was terminated at the end of the war, a total of 262 helicopters had been constructed.\n\nDuring Chrysler's occupancy of the complex, it was known Jeep and (Dodge) Truck Engineering (JTE), including facilities for Body on Frame (BoF) work as well as testing facilities and labs.

Holmes had its main office and [[foundry]] at 200 Exmouth Street, [[Sarnia, Ontario]], Canada. Holmes was established in 1918, by Mr. J. S. Blunt, and was called Holmes Blunt Limited. In the early years, [[Ford Motor Company]] contracted the plant for a steady supply of engine casting blocks. This factory had a reputation locally as a dirty, dangerous place to work. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, AMC contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply AMC with [[cylinder block]] castings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/my/HolmesFoundry/|title=Holmes Foundry: Sarnia, Ontario|publisher=Holmes Foundry|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966. In July 1970, AMC acquired 100% of Holmes Foundry through an exchange of shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=American Newsletter|magazine=The Foundry|publisher=Institute of British Foundrymen|volume=129|year=1970}}</ref> However, it was not until October 1981 that Holmes Foundry finally became a Division of American Motors, Canada. As part of its acquisition of AMC in 1987, Chrysler Corporation took ownership of the Holmes facility and its manufacturing business but closed the operation on September 16, 1988. The industrial facilities were cleaned of their [[environmental contaminant]]s in 2005, in preparation for a new [[Interchange (road)|highway interchange]] to be built on the site.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Glenn Stokes|title=Dump trailer liners used in decommissioned foundry clean-up project|magazine=Environmental Science & Engineering|url=https://esemag.com/archive/1105/hqn.html|date=November 2005|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>\n* '''Kenosha \"Lakefront\" (Kenosha, Wisconsin) Plant''' \u2013 The AMC plant in downtown Kenosha along Lake Michigan was razed, and after reclamation the land was used for new development. At the company's inception in 1954, the plant covered {{convert|3195000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and together with the Milwaukee plant had an annual production capacity of 350,000 cars.<ref name=Ward>{{cite book|author=James Arthur Ward|title=The Fall of the Packard Motor Car Company|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1995|page=124|isbn=978-0-8047-2457-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7D11a-EPzwMC&pg=PA124|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>\n* '''Milwaukee Body (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) Plant''' \u2013 AMC inherited a {{convert|1600000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}<ref name=Ward/> body plant in Milwaukee from Nash. The plant was the main body plant for Seaman Body Company, which did a lot of business with Nash and other makers assembling bodies of various designs. For AMC, the plant was sometimes an internal headache. For instance, in late 1961, George Romney himself stormed through the plant and threatened to close it and eliminate its 9,000 jobs due to labor problems.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Management: Crackdown in Milwaukee|magazine=Time|date=December 1, 1961|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938842,00.html|url-access=subscription|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> The plant survived until the Chrysler buyout. Chrysler later decided to dispose of the factory. Upon closure, the site was named as a Superfund site. The factory was demolished and the site rehabilitated and redeveloped.\n* '''Danforth Ave (Toronto, Ontario) Plant''' \u2013 Inherited from Nash. This plant was purchased by Nash from Ford of Canada in 1946. The first Canadian-built Nash rolled off the line in April, 1950. Upon the formation of American Motors in 1954, the plant assembled 1955 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Ramblers]] (2- and 4-door sedans); as well as [[Nash Statesman|Nash Canadian Statesman]] and [[Hudson Wasp]] (4 door sedans). In 1956, the plant continued to assemble Nash and Hudson Rambler (4-door sedans and wagons) and the Nash Canadian Statesman (4-door sedan); but The Hudson Wasp was imported. That same year, American Motors Sales (Canada) Limited was formed \u2013 taking over Nash Motors of Canada Limited and Hudson Motors of Canada Limited. In 1957, AMC assembled the [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel]] V8 at the Danforth plant; but in July 1957, AMC closed the plant and imported Ramblers into Canada until 1961. The structure remains today as the [[Shoppers World Danforth]] [[Lowe's]] store.\n* '''[[Tilbury, Ontario]] Assembly Plant''' \u2013 Another plant AMC inherited from the 1954 merger; this one via Hudson. Specifically, it was a contract with CHATCO Steel Products which actually owned the plant. American Motors ceased Hudson production at the Tilbury plant in 1955.\n* '''Brampton Assembly Plant''' \u2013 AMC opened a plant in 1960 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. It was part of American Motors Canada, Inc. Rambler Drive, a small street just west of this plant, still exists and leads into a residential subdivision that was built in the 1960s. In 1987, with the Chrysler buyout, the division and the plant were absorbed as well, becoming part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant was closed in 1994 and sold to Wal-Mart for use as their Canadian warehouse. This plant/warehouse was demolished in 2004 and redeveloped in 2007 with multiple smaller commercial buildings now onsite; a new Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse now takes up the largest section of this commercial development. Note that this is a separate facility from the current [[Brampton Assembly|Brampton (formerly Bramalea) Assembly]] and Satellite Stamping Plants nearby.\n* '''South Charleston Stamping Plant''' \u2013 A [[South Charleston, West Virginia]], facility. While AMC leased it, the plant stamped steel automotive parts.

Mason]] to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" automakers ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler]]). The merger was intended to be the first step of amalgamating the Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard marques into a single company. The plan was for Nash to acquire Hudson and for Packard to acquire Studebaker, then merge the four marques into one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/amc/|title=The Spirit Is Still Alive: American Motors Corporation 1954-1987|website=allpar.com|author=Chad Quella}}</ref> Mason had first discussed the possibility of a merger with Packard president [[James J.

Barit]] retired to become an AMC board member. Mason selected long-time Nash associate and future governor of Michigan, [[George W. Romney]] as Vice president. [[Roy Abernethy]], ex Vice president of Sales for [[Willys]], was hired to be Vice president of Sales for AMC.\n\nFollowing Mason's sudden death on October 8, 1954, Romney took over, reorganizing the company and focusing AMC's future on a new small car line.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861782,00.html|url-access=subscription|title=Gamble on the Rambler|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 19, 1955|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> Mason's death also allowed Romney to put an end to any further discussions for a merger between AMC and [[Studebaker-Packard]].\n\nBy the end of 1957, the legacy Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out, replaced with the [[Rambler (automobile)|Rambler]] and [[Nash Metropolitan|Metropolitan]] brands. The company struggled at first, but under Abernethy, Rambler sales took off. A Rambler won the 1959 [[Mobil Economy Run]] and by 1960, was the third most popular brand of automobile in the United States, behind Ford and Chevrolet.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864627,00.html|url-access=subscription|title=Autos: Victory for Rambler|magazine=Time|date=April 20, 1959|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm|title=1965\u20131966 Rambler Ambassador|authors=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com|date=October 23, 2007|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGeorge Romney left AMC in 1962 to run for governor in Michigan and was replaced as CEO by Roy Abernethy. After two model years (1963 and 1964) of only producing compact cars, Abernethy shifted the focus of AMC back to larger and more profitable cars like the Ambassador line from the perceived negative of the Rambler's [[economy car]] image. Ambassador sales jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965. In 1966 they went to more than 71,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autos.ca/classic-cars/motoring-memories-amc-ambassador-1965-1966/|author=Bill Vance|title=Motoring Memories: AMC Ambassador, 1965-1966|publisher=Autos Canada|date=17 March 2006|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> However, the huge costs of developing the new cars and engines meant AMC now had problems in securing [[working capital]] to keep the company going. AMC sales dropped twenty percent in the first half of 1966, and the firm reported a fiscal six-month loss of $4.2 million on sales of $479 million. Consequently, [[Robert B. Evans]] invested more than [[United States dollar|US$]]2 million because AMC's stock was selling for only 60 percent of the company's [[net worth]]; thus he became its largest [[stockholder]] and was named its chairman on June 6, 1966, replacing Richard E.

Smathers Libraries]] at the [[University of Florida]]}}</ref>\n\nChapin took charge to revitalize the company, and designer [[Richard A. Teague]] economized by developing several vehicles from common stampings. While prices and costs were cut, new and more sporty automobiles were introduced, and from 1968 AMC became known for the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] and [[AMC AMX|AMX]] [[muscle car]]s.\n\nAMC purchased [[Kaiser Jeep|Kaiser]]'s [[Jeep]] utility vehicle operations in 1970 to complement its existing passenger car business. Beginning in the early 1970s, the company moved towards all-new compact car designs based on the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]], including the Hornet itself and the [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]]. Other new models in the 1970s included the [[AMC Matador|Matador]] and [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]]. Sagging sales and tight finances resulted in the elimination of the Matador line in the 1979 model year and the Pacer line in 1980, leaving AMC to focus almost exclusively on its Hornet [[automobile platform|platform]] based cars and the Jeep line. Hornet derivatives of the late 1970s included the [[AMC Spirit|Spirit]] and [[AMC Concord|Concord]], while the innovative 4-wheel-drive [[AMC Eagle]] introduced in 1979 was one of the first true [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]].\n\nFrom 1980, AMC partnered with France's [[Renault]] to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. By 1983 Renault had a controlling interest in AMC. After the 1983 model year, the AMC brand focused entirely on [[all wheel drive|AWD]] autos; the company stopped producing two-wheel drive cars. AMC facilities were used to produce the Renault-branded Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars. In 1985 Chrysler entered an agreement with AMC to produce Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Furys as well as Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in AMC's [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], plant. At the time, AMC had excess manufacturing capacity, thus contract manufacturing for Chrysler made sense. In 1987, after further new vehicle development that included the [[Eagle Medallion|Medallion]] (a re-badged [[Renault 21]]) and [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]'s Italdesign new [[full-size car|full-size]] [[front-wheel drive|front-drive]] sedan that became the [[Eagle Premier]],<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Jim Dunne|title=Inside Detroit|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=June 1986|volume=163|issue=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42|page=42|accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Business Week|date=April 28, 1986|title=Can American Motors shed its sad-sack image?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUw1AAAAMAAJ&q=A+two-+door+coupe,+the+X-59,+debuts+in+1988|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref> Renault sold its 47% ownership stake in AMC to [[Chrysler]]. Chrysler made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of AMC stock on the NYSE. Renault left the US market completely as a brand in 1987. The Renault Medallion was sold through the newly formed Jeep Eagle Division of Chrysler as an Eagle, not a Renault. AMC's badge would be used on the Eagle Sports Wagon through the 1988 model year, then be eliminated entirely. The [[Jeep-Eagle|Jeep/Eagle]] division of Chrysler Corporation was formed from the AMC Jeep Renault dealer network. The [[Jeep]] and [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] vehicles were marketed primarily by former AMC [[Car dealership|dealers]]. Ultimately, the Eagle Brand of car would be phased out like Chrysler's [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], Plymouth, and Imperial by 1998.\n\n== 1954 creation ==\n\nIn January 1954, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation began acquisition of the Hudson Motor Car Company (in what was called a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]]). The new corporation would be called American Motors Corporation. (An earlier corporation with the same name, co-founded by [[Louis Chevrolet]], had existed in New Jersey from 1916 through 1922 before merging into the Bessemer\u2013American Motors Corporation.)\n\nThe Nash-Kelvinator/Hudson deal was a straight [[stock transfer agent|stock transfer]] (three shares of Hudson listed at 11\u215b, for two shares of AMC and one share of Nash-Kelvinator listed at 17\u215c, for one share of AMC) and finalized in the spring of 1954, forming the fourth-biggest auto company in the U.S. with [[asset]]s of US$355&nbsp;million and more than $100&nbsp;million in [[working capital]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,823270,00.html|url-access=subscription|title=Answer from the Hustlers|magazine=Time|date=January 25, 1954|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> The new company retained Hudson CEO [[A.E.

The separate Nash and Hudson dealer networks were retained. The Hudsons were redesigned to bring them in harmony with Nash body styles.\n\nThe fast-selling Rambler model was sold as both a Nash and a Hudson in 1955 and 1956. These [[Badge engineering|badge-engineered]] Ramblers, along with similar Metropolitans, were identical save for hubcaps, nameplates, and other minor trim details.\n\nThe pre-existing full-size Nash product line was continued and the [[Nash Statesman]] and Ambassador were restyled as the \"new\" [[Hudson Wasp]] and [[Hudson Hornet]]. Although the cars shared the same body shell, they were at least as different from one another as Chevrolet and Pontiac. Hudsons and Nashes each used their own engines as they had previously: the Hudson Hornet continued to offer the {{convert|308|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 that had powered the ([[NASCAR]]) champion during the early 1950s; the Wasp now used the former engine of the Hudson Jet.\n\nThe Nash Ambassador and Statesman continued with overhead- valve and L-head sixes respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable but other body panels, rear window glass, dash panels and braking systems were different. The Hudson Hornet and Wasp, and their Nash counterparts, had improved ride and visibility; also better fuel economy owing to the lighter unitized Nash body.\n\nFor the 1958 model year, the Nash and Hudson brands were dropped. [[Rambler (car)|Rambler]] became a marque in its own right and the mainstay of the company. The popular British-built Metropolitan subcompact continued as a standalone brand until it was discontinued in 1961. The prototype 1958 [[Nash Ambassador]] / [[Hudson Hornet]], built on a stretched Rambler platform, was renamed at the last minute as \"Ambassador by Rambler\". To round out the model line AMC reintroduced the old 1955, {{convert|100|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase [[Nash Rambler]] as the new [[Rambler American]] with only a few modifications. This gave Rambler a compact lineup with {{convert|100|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} American, {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], as well as the {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Ambassador wheelbase vehicles.\n\n=== The \"dinosaur-fighter\" ===\nSales of Ramblers soared in the late 1950s in part because of American Motors' focus on the compact car and its marketing efforts. These included sponsoring the hugely popular [[Walt Disney anthology television series]] and as an exhibitor at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. George Romney himself pitched the Rambler product in the television commercials.\n\nWhile the \"Big Three\" introduced ever-larger cars, AMC followed a \"dinosaur-fighter\" strategy. [[George W. Romney]]'s leadership focused the company on the compact car, a fuel-efficient vehicle 20 years before there was a real need for them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gerald C.

Two core [[Critical success factor|strategic factors]] came into play: (1) the use of shared components in AMC products and (2) a refusal to participate in the Big Three's restyling race. This cost-control policy helped Rambler develop a reputation as solid economy cars.

Abernethy also called for the de-emphasis of the Rambler brand, because he believed the public associated it too strongly with economy cars, and that it was hindering the sale of AMC's other models at a time when mid and luxury car sales was very strong. As a result, he ordered that for 1966, the Ambassador and Marlin were to be badged purely as a product of American Motors Corporation.<ref>http://wildaboutcarsonline.com/cgi-bin/pub9990262549620.cgi?itemid=9990287407543&categoryid=9990287330870</ref> This was followed by the 1968 [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel]].

Innovative marketing ideas included making [[air conditioning]] standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a delete option). This made AMC the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]], and [[Cadillac]].\n\nThe company introduced exciting entries for the decade's [[muscle car]] boom, most notably the [[AMC AMX|AMX]], while the [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]] served as the company's entrant into the sporty \"pony car\" market created by the [[Ford Mustang]]. Additional operating cash was derived in 1968 through the sale of [[Kelvinator]] Appliance, once one of the firm's core operating units. The Kelvinator divestiture left AMC a downsized company solely manufacturing automobiles.\n\nThe Rambler brand was completely dropped after the 1969 model year in North America, although it continued to be used in several overseas markets as either a model or brand name, with the last use in [[Mexico]] in 1983. From 1970, AMC was the brand used for all American Motors passenger cars; and all vehicles from that date bore the AMC name and the new corporate logo. However, the names American Motors and AMC were used interchangeably in corporate literature well into the 1980s. The branding issue was further complicated when the company's [[AMC Eagle|Eagle]] [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] passenger cars were marketed as the American Eagle in the 1980s.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== 1970s product developments ==\n[[File:1972 AMC Gremlin X green 5-litre V8 Nashville.jpg|thumb|1972 Gremlin X]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop (26912016752).jpg|thumb|right|1971 Ambassador hardtop with \"Brougham\" trim]]\n[[File:1975 AMC Matador base sedan in Fawn Beige 03.jpg|thumb|right|1975 Matador sedan]]\n[[File:Portland AM General bus in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|AM General transit bus]]\n[[File:Matador1.JPG|thumb|right|1974 Matador X Coupe]]\n[[File:1975 AMC Pacer base model frontrightside.jpg|thumb|right|1975 AMC Pacer]]\n[[File:1976 AMC Hornet Sportabout.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Hornet Sportabout]]\n[[File:Jeep Cherokee SJ Chief S f.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee (SJ) Chief S]]\n[[File:1979 AMC Spirit GT V8 Russet FR.jpg|thumb|right|1979 Spirit GT]]\n\n'''Jeep'''\n\nIn the late 1960s [[Kaiser Jeep]] Corporation (formerly [[Willys]]-Overland) decided to leave the automotive industry and sought a buyer for its money-losing [[Jeep]] division. AMC's Vice President for Manufacturing, [[Gerald C. Meyers]] headed the team sent to evaluate Kaiser's Jeep factories. Although opposed by AMC top management, Chapin made a major decision in February 1970 to purchase Kaiser's Jeep operations for $70 million. Although it was a gamble Chapin believed that Jeep vehicles would complement AMC's passenger car business. The Jeep market was also a market in which the Big Three had no presence, and therefore there was no competition. AMC gained the iconic Jeep brand of light trucks and SUVs, as well as Kaiser-Jeep's government contracts \u2013 notably the [[M151]] line of military Jeeps and the [[Jeep DJ|DJ-Series]] [[United States Postal Service|postal]] Jeeps. AMC also expanded their international network. The military and special products business was reconstituted as American Motors General Products Division, later reorganized as [[AM General]].\n\n'''Hornet and Gremlin'''\n\nIn 1970, AMC consolidated all passenger cars under one distinct brand identity and debuted the [[AMC Hornet|Hornet]] range of compact cars. The Hornet and the later [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]] shared [[Automobile platform|platforms]]. The Gremlin, the first North American-built subcompact, sold more than 670,000 units from 1970 to 1978. The Hornet became AMC's best-selling passenger car since the Rambler Classic, with more than 860,000 units sold by the time production ended in 1977. The Hornet platform continued to be built under a variety of models through 1987.\n\nFor a time, both the Hornet and Gremlin could be ordered with [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] denim interiors. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/these-vintage-hornets-prove-even-cars-were-hit-by-the-blue-jeans-craze-of-the-1970s|title=Even AMC cars were hit by the blue jeans craze of the 1970s|last=|first=|date=|website=ME-TV Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Matador'''\n\nThe new facelifted, mid-sized [[AMC Matador]] replaced the Rebel in 1971, using an advertising campaign that asked, \"What's a Matador?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.javelinamx.com/JavHome/articles/matx-rt.htm|title=Road Test: American Motors Matador X from ''Road & Track''|date=March 1974|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184149/http://www.javelinamx.com/JavHome/articles/matx-rt.htm|archivedate=May 11, 2008|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}</ref> In 1972, AMC won the tender for [[Los Angeles Police Department]] cruisers, and Matadors were used by the department from 1972 to 1975, replacing the [[Plymouth Satellite]]. American Motors supplied [[Mark VII Limited]] owner [[Jack Webb]] with two Matadors, a sedan and a wagon, for use in his popular television series ''[[Adam-12]]'', increasing the cars' public profile.\n\nIn 1973, AMC signed a licensing agreement with [[Curtiss-Wright]] to build [[Wankel engine]]s for cars and Jeeps.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_15/|author=Ward's Auto World Staff|title=Rearview mirror|magazine=Ward's Auto World|date=February 1, 2000|accessdate=August 31, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105205047/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_rearview_mirror_15/|archivedate=November 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \n\nStarting in 1974, the Matador sedan and station wagon were mildly refreshed, with new boxier front and rear ends.

The additional length was due to a new front end design and stronger energy-absorbing bumpers required of all automobiles sold in the U.S.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Jan P.

The full-sized Ambassador was discontinued as AMC's flagship line after the 1974 model year, leaving only the Matador as AMC's full-size offering. Nash and AMC made Ambassadors from 1927 to 1974, the longest use of the same model name for any AMC product and, at the time, the longest continuously used nameplate in the industry.\n\n'''Metropolitan Buses'''\n\nIn 1974, AMC's AM General subsidiary began building urban transit buses in cooperation with [[New Flyer Industries|Flyer Industries]] of [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. The ''Metropolitan'' coach had sold 5,212 units when production ceased in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omot.org/roster/buses/amg.html|title=Coach Manufacturer History \u2013 AM General|publisher=Ohio Museum of Transportation|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''Pacer'''\n\nThe [[AMC Pacer]], an innovative all-new model introduced in March 1975 and marketed as \"the first wide small car\", was a subcompact designed to provide the comfort of a full-sized car. Its pre-production development coincided tightened U.S. Federal passenger [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] and [[Car safety|auto safety]] regulations.\n\nWith the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of 1973, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] aborted the [[Wankel rotary engine]] around which the Pacer had been designed, as its fuel consumption exceeded that of conventional engines with similar power. Therefore, AMC's existing {{convert|258|and|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine]]s were used in the Pacer instead. Fuel economy was better than a rotary but still relatively poor in light of the new focus on energy efficiency. Also, as the Pacer shared few components other than drivetrain with other AMC cars, it was expensive to make and the cost increased when sales fell steeply after the first two years.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nDevelopment and production costs for the Pacer and Matador Coupe drained capital which might otherwise have been invested in updating the more popular Hornet and Gremlin lines so that toward the end of the 1970s the company faced the growing energy crisis with aged products that were uncompetitive in hotly contested markets. However, \"AMC used cars, as far back as 1967, had the advantage of good warranty coverage \u2026 so most owners were conscious of low-cost car maintenance \u2026 AMC units [became] some of the very best buys on the used car market\" by 1975.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Buying a Used Car|magazine=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|date=January 1975|volume=29|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27|accessdate=January 16, 2011|page=27|authors=Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc}}</ref>\n\nThe 1977 Gremlin had redesigned headlights, grille, rear hatch and fascia. For economy in the fuel crisis, AMC offered the car with a more fuel-efficient [[Volkswagen]]-designed [[Audi]] 4-cylinder engine {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}. The engine was expensive for AMC to build and the Gremlin retained the less costly but also less economical {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} as standard equipment.\n\nThe [[AMC AMX|AMX]] nameplate was revived in 1977.

Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with opera windows, and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.\n\n'''Concord'''\n\nFor 1978, the Hornet [[automobile platform|platform]] was redesigned with an adaptation of the new Gremlin front-end design and renamed [[AMC Concord]]. AMC targeted it at the emerging \"premium compact\" market segment, paying particular attention to ride and handling, standard equipment, trim, and interior luxury.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Rich Ceppos|title=AMC for '78 \u2013 a V-8 for the Pacer, and now there's Concord|magazine=Popular Science|page=98|date=October 1977|volume=211|issue=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQEAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA98|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGremlins borrowed the Concord instrument panel, as well as a Hornet AMX-inspired GT sports appearance package and a new striping treatment for X models.\n\nThe AMC Pacer hood was modified to clear a V8 engine, and a Sports package replaced the former X package. With falling sales of Matador Coupes, sedans and wagons, their {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was dropped, leaving only the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Inline-6 (standard on coupes and sedans) and the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 (optional on coupes and sedans, standard on wagons). The two-tone Barcelona luxury package was offered on Matador sedans, and two-tone red paint introduced as an additional Barcelona option. Matador production ceased at the end of the model year with total sales of 10,576 units. The Matador was no longer attractive as automakers struggled to overcome economic woes including continuing fuel price increases and double-digit domestic inflation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas J.

The distribution network was also not well supported, which led to lower quality delivered by dealerships with \"disastrous consequences\" for the image of the automobiles, as well as high warranty costs because of quality failings which greatly impacted sales from 1985 to the end of production in 1987.<ref name=\"foreign\">{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|author2=Lina G\u00e1lvez-Mu\u00f1oz|title=Foreign multinationals in the United States: management and performance|chapter=6|year=2001|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-25055-9|pages=110\u2013112|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AnsvkPyJPiAC&pg=PA110&dq=Renault+Alliance|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Encore models were renamed Alliance Hatchback in 1987. Alliance and GTA production ended in June of that year while the Renault 9 and 11 models continued through the 1988 model year in Europe, being replaced by the all new Renault 19.\n\n=== Jeeps ===\n[[File:Jeep Cherokee XJ 4D Laredo burgundy SOP rr.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Cherokee Laredo]]\n[[File:Jeep Comanche Pioneer white MD r.jpg|thumb|right|Jeep Comanche Pioneer]]\nMore beneficial to AMC's future was the introduction of an all-new line of compact [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] and [[Jeep Wagoneer|Wagoneer]] models in the autumn of 1983 for the 1984 model year. The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV). They initially used the AMC 150 C.I.D. (2.5L) [[AMC Straight-4 engine|OHV four-cylinder engine]] with a [[carburetor]], and a General Motors-built {{convert|2.8|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5&nbsp;L I4 engines. A Renault {{convert|2.1|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} Turbo-Diesel I4 [[Diesel engine|diesel]] was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a {{convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} I6 engine, derived from the older {{convert|258|CID|L|abbr=on}} I6 with a new head design and an electronic [[fuel injection]] system, replaced the [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] V6. American Motors' \"new\" engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix ([[Renix]]) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design continued to be improved and refined until its discontinuation at the end of the 2006 model year. The 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding {{convert|300000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The XJ Cherokee itself was built by Chrysler until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China.\n\nThree other designs continued to be used after the Chrysler buyout: the Grand Wagoneer full-size luxury SUV, the full-sized J-series pickups, built on the same chassis as the earlier SJ model Wagoneers and Cherokees that dated from 1963 with the AMC {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, and the [[Jeep Comanche]] (MJ) compact pickup, which debuted in 1986. Unlike most sport-utility vehicles which are based on adapted pickup truck designs, the Cherokee XJ SUV came first and the Comanche was designed as a later pickup truck version.\n\nProduction of the full-sized pickups ceased after 1987. The Grand Wagoneer and 360 V8 engine were dropped after 1991 (the last American-made vehicle whose engine used a [[carburetor]] for fuel delivery), and the Comanche bowed after 1992.\n\n== 1985 and the final buyout ==\n\n=== Marketplace and management changes ===\nThere were significant changes in 1985 as the market moved away from AMC's small models. With fuel relatively cheap again, buyers turned to larger more powerful automobiles and AMC was unprepared for this development. Even the venerable Jeep CJ-5 was dropped after a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' TV news magazine expos\u00e9 of rollover tendencies under extreme conditions. AMC also confronted an angry workforce. Labor was taking revenge, and reports circulated about sabotage of vehicles on the assembly lines because of the failure to receive promised wage increases{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}. There were rumors that the aging Kenosha plant was to be shut down. At the same time, Chrysler was having trouble meeting the demand for its M-body rear-drive models ([[Dodge Diplomat]], [[Plymouth Gran Fury]] and [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]]). Because they were assembled using the old \"gate and buck system\" and the tooling could be easily moved, Chrysler could supply the components and control the quality, while AMC assembled the car. Therefore, Lee Iacocca and Joe Cappy reached an agreement to use some of AMC's idle plant capacity in Kenosha.<ref name=sharf>{{cite magazine|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_lee_iacocca_knew/index.html|author=Stephan Sharf|title=Lee Iacocca as I knew him; he was certainly the right man at the right time..|magazine=Ward's AutoWorld|date=May 1, 1996|accessdate=August 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081658/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_lee_iacocca_knew/index.html|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThese problems came in the midst of a transfer of power at AMC from Paul Tippet to a French executive, Pierre Semerena. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care [[Wheel Horse]] Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People's Republic of China. [[The Pentagon]] had problems with [[AM General]], a significant [[defense contractor]], being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a significant portion of an important defense supplier.<ref>{{cite book |author=Byron Olsen|author2=Barney Olsen|author3=Joseph Cabadas|title=The American Auto Factory|year=2002|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=978-0-7603-1059-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iZJzb91qsE4C&pg=PA127|accessdate=November 24, 2010|page=127}}</ref> As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold. Another milestone was the departure of [[Richard A. Teague|Dick Teague]]: AMC's design vice president for 26 years, he was responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs including the Rambler American, Javelin, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, and Matador coupe.\n\n=== Problems at Renault and assassination ===\nAmerican Motors' major stockholder, Renault, was itself experiencing financial trouble in France. The investment in AMC (including the construction of a new Canadian assembly plant in [[Brampton]], Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass [[layoff]]s. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) They could declare AMC officially bankrupt thereby lose its investment; (2) They could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived AMC as a bottomless pit; or (3) AMC could be put up for sale and the French could get back part of their investment. Against these detractions, Renault's chairman, [[Georges Besse]], continued to champion the French firm's future in the North American market; pointing to the company's completion of the newest and most-advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as [[Brampton Assembly|Bramalea Assembly]], as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0&nbsp;L and 2.5&nbsp;L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that AMC was on course for profitability.\n\nHowever, on November 17, 1986, [[Georges Besse]], who had a high-profile among French capitalists, was assassinated by a member of a militant extremist group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164838/Direct-Action|work=Enyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Direct Action|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Chrysler purchases AMC Stock ===\nUnder pressure from Renault executives following Besse's death, Renault's new president, Raymond Levy set out to repair employee relations and [[Divestment|divest]] the company of its investment in American Motors.

According to the head of manufacturing for Chrysler at the time, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with AMC producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations.<ref name=sharf/>\n\n[[File:1st Jeep Grand Cherokee .jpg|thumb|The [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was the driving force behind Chrysler's buyout of AMC; Lee Iacocca wanted the design. Chrysler completed development and released it to the public in late 1992, and continues to use the nameplate today.]]\n\nOn March 9, 1987, Chrysler agreed to buy Renault's share in AMC, plus all the remaining shares, for about US$1.5&nbsp;billion (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000000|1987}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=holusha/> AMC became the [[Jeep-Eagle]] division of Chrysler. It was the Jeep brand that Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] really wanted \u2013 in particular the ZJ [[Jeep Grand Cherokee|Grand Cherokee]], then under development by Jeep engineers, which ultimately proved highly profitable for Chrysler (the nameplate remains in production today). However, the buyout included other attractive deal sweeteners for Chrysler. Among them was the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in [[Bramalea, Ontario]], which offered Iacocca an unprecedented opportunity to increase his company's [[Capacity utilization|production capacity]] at a fire-sale price. AMC had designed and built the plant in anticipation of building the [[Renault 25]] based [[Eagle Premier]]. Additional profitable acquisitions were the AMC dealer network (the addition of which strengthened Chrysler's retail distribution \u2013 many AMC dealers switched to selling Chrysler products); and AMC's underrated organization and management talent \u2013 which Chrysler quickly assimilated (numerous leading Chrysler engineers and executives were ex-AMC).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html|title=DaimlerChrysler: The 'What Ifs?'|magazine=Ward's AutoWorld|4=|date=June 1, 1998|accessdate=August 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081757/http://wardsautoworld.com/ar/auto_daimlerchrysler_ifs/index.html|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> AMC was renamed Jeep Eagle Corporation (a Chrysler subsidiary) August 25, 1988, and was fully merged as of March 29, 1990.<ref name=cofs.lara.state.mi.us/>\n\nThe sale came at a time when the automotive press was enthusiastic about the proposed 1988 lineup of Renault, Eagle and Jeep vehicles, and reports that the financial outlook for the tiny automaker was improving. AMC quarterly results for all of 1987 were positive, Chrysler purchased AMC at a time the company appeared to be in a very good financial position with its new product line.<ref name=holusha/>\n\n== Business legacy ==\nAmerican Motors was forced to constantly innovate for 33 years until Chrysler absorbed it in 1987. The lessons learned from this experience were integrated into the company that bought AMC. The organization, strategies, as well as several key executives,  allowed Chrysler to gain an edge on the competition. Even today, the lessons gained from the AMC experience continue to provide benefits to other firms in the industry. There are a number of legacies from AMC's [[Strategic management|business strategies]].\n\nAMC had an ability to formulate strategies that were often evaluated by industry critics as \"strokes of brilliance\".<ref name=Higgins>{{cite news|author=James V. Higgins|title=Roy Chapin Jr. mastered how to survive in auto industry|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=August 12, 2001}}</ref> According to [[Roy D.

This approach was finally accepted within the U.S. [[auto industry]], but only after each of the Big Three experienced the failure of attempting to be self-sufficient.\n\nThe smallest domestic automaker did not have \"the massive R&D budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors \u2026 [thus] AMC placed R&D emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps).\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpAoAQAAMAAJ&q=AMC|title=R&D Decision Area|author1=John A.

AMC was also effective in other areas such as marketing by introducing low rate financing. AMC's four-wheel drive vehicles established the foundation for the modern SUV market segments, and \"classic\" Jeep models continue to be the benchmark in this field. Roy D. Chapin drew on his experiences as a hunter and fisherman and marketed the Jeep brand successfully to people with like interests. The brand developed a cult appeal that continues.<ref name=Fracassa>{{cite news|author=Hawke Fracassa|title=Roy D. Chapin Jr., ex-AMC chairman gambled to save Jeep|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=August 7, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe purchase of AMC was instrumental in reviving Chrysler. According to [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Robert Lutz]], former President of Chrysler, the AMC acquisition was a big and risky undertaking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lutz|first=Robert A.|year=1999|title=Guts: The Seven Laws of Business That Made Chrysler the World's Hottest Car Company|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-35765-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gutssevenlawsofb00lutz}}</ref> The purchase was part of Chrysler's strategic \"retreat-cum-diversification\" plan that he states did not have the right focus. Initially, the goal was to obtain the world-renowned Jeep brand. However, Lutz discovered that the decision to buy AMC turned out to be a gold mine for Chrysler.<ref>Lutz, p. 16.</ref> At that time, Chrysler's management was attempting to find a model to improve structure and operations, ''\"something that would help get our minds unstuck and thinking beyond the old paradigms that we were so familiar with''\".<ref name=\"lutz-31\">Lutz, p. 31.</ref> In this transformation, ''\"Chrysler's acquisition of AMC was one of the all-time great moments in corporate serendipity''\" according to Lutz ''\"that most definitely played a key role in demonstrating how to accomplish change''\".<ref name=\"lutz-31\"/>\n\nAccording to Lutz (1993), while AMC had its share of problems, it was far from being a bunch of \"brain-dead losers\". He describes the \"troops\" at AMC as more like the [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island Marines]] in battle, \"with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products\".<ref name=\"lutz-33\">Lutz, p. 33.</ref> After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by AMC, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former AMC units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, AMC's lead engineer, [[Fran\u00e7ois Castaing]], was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place, AMC's \"[[Automobile platform|platform team]]\" was implemented. These were close-knit cross-functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as \"the engineering company\" was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action was going to change that.<ref name=\"lutz-33\"/> In summary, Chrysler's purchase of AMC laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.\n\nTop managers at Chrysler after the AMC buyout appeared to have made errors similar to those by AMC. For example, Chrysler invested heavily in new untested models while not keeping up its profitable high-volume lines.\n\n\nThe AMC influence also continued at [[General Motors]]. GM recruited a new executive team to turn itself from near bankruptcy in the early 2000s. Among the new strategists at GM was Lutz who brought an understanding of the importance of passion in the product design. Lutz implemented a new thinking at GM that incorporated the systems and structures that originated from AMC's lean and focused operations.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Alex Taylor III|title=Finally GM is looking good|magazine=Fortune|volume=145|issue=7|date=April 1, 2002|pages=69\u201374|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/04/01/320620/index.htm|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRenault implemented the lessons it learned from its investment in AMC. The French firm took a parallel approach as it did with its initial ownership of AMC and applied it to resurrect the money-losing [[Nissan]] automaker in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RZ-RuS9VNSgC&pg=PR5|title=Shift: Inside Nissan's Historic Revival\n|year=2007|author=Carlos Ghosn|authorlink=Carlos Ghosn|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780307423818}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, in a deal brokered by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], [[Italy|Italian]] automaker [[Fiat]] initiated a [[White knight (business)|white knight]] takeover of Chrysler to save the struggling automaker from liquidation. The deal was immediately compared to the AMC-Renault deal; some commentators noted the irony in that Chrysler now faced the same fate that AMC faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there were key differences between the two:\n*Fiat CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] became CEO of Chrysler as part of the deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler's assets and product lines;\n*the Fiat-Chrysler merger did not face the political opposition the AMC-Renault deal did since Fiat is led by a family group with significant equity and the US government supported the merger;\n*while AMC proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and has since become an important source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the [[European debt crisis]].\n\nThe two firms would later fully merge to create [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Reuters]]|location=London, UK|title=Fiat says merger into Dutch-registered FCA effective October 12|date=7 October 2014|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/07/us-fiat-spa-chrysler-idUSKCN0HW0CZ20141007}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy of products ==\n\n=== Passenger automobiles ===\n[[File:Eagle Premier.jpg|thumb|right|Eagle Premier]]\nChrysler revived the \"Spirit\" name dropped by AMC after 1983 for use on one of its [[Chrysler A platform|A platform]] cars, (the [[Dodge Spirit]]) from 1989 to 1995. The planned [[Renault Medallion]] was sold as the [[Eagle Medallion]] in 1988 and 1989. The planned all-new 1988 Renault Premier, a joint development effort between American Motors and Renault, and for which the [[Brampton Assembly]] plant ([[Brampton]], Ontario\u2014originally called the Bramalea Plant) was built, was sold by Chrysler as the 1988\u20131992 [[Eagle Premier]], with a rebadged [[Dodge Monaco]] variant available from 1990 to 1992. The [[Full-size car|full-sized]] Premier's platform was far more advanced than anything Chrysler was building at the time. After some re-engineering and a re-designation to Chrysler [[Chrysler LH platform|code LH]], the Eagle Premier went on to form the backbone of Chrysler's passenger car lineup during the 1990s as the [[Chrysler Concorde]] (a revived model name that was briefly used by [[Plymouth Concord|Plymouth]] in 1951 and 1952), [[Chrysler New Yorker]], [[Chrysler LHS]], [[Dodge Intrepid]], and [[Eagle Vision]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=John A. Hailig|title=To the Edge and Back: Re-Emergence in the Eighties|magazine=Automobile Quarterly|volume=32|issue=4|page=104}}</ref> Plymouth almost received their own rendition of the LH platform, which was to be called the Accolade, but Chrysler decided to nix this idea not long before LH production started. The [[Chrysler 300M]] was likewise a Premier/LH-derived car and was initially to have been the next-generation Eagle Vision, until the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand was dropped after 1998. The LH Platform was subsequently re-engineered, using [[Mercedes-Benz]] components, into the [[Chrysler LX Platform]] which remains in production today underpinning the [[Chrysler 300]], [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] and [[Dodge Challenger]].\n\n=== Jeep vehicles ===\n[[File:Jeep Comanche Chief.jpg|thumb|Jeep Comanche]]\nChrysler marketed the SJ [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Grand Wagoneer]] until 1991, leaving it almost entirely unaltered from the final AMC rendition before the buyout. The [[Jeep Comanche]] pickup truck remained until 1992, while the Cherokee remained until 2001 in the U.S. (the XJ Cherokee was produced in China through 2006 as the Cherokee 2500<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007112_737100.htm|last=Dunne|first=Timothy|title=Can Chrysler Rebound in China?|magazine=Business Week|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105074509/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007112_737100.htm|archivedate=November 5, 2007}}</ref> [2.5L] and Cherokee 4000 [4.0L]). Although it was not introduced until 1993, the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] was initially an AMC-developed vehicle.\n\nTraces of AMC remained within. AMC's Toledo, Ohio, plants continued to manufacture the Jeep Wrangler and [[Jeep Liberty|Liberty]], as well as parts and components for Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles (although Toledo Machining and Forge was closed in 2005). AMC's main plant in Wisconsin, albeit heavily downsized, operated as the [[Kenosha Engine]] Plant, producing engines for several Chrysler Group products including the Wrangler. The plant was closed as part of the post-bailout restructuring of Chrysler in October 2010. The {{convert|242|cuin|L|1|order=flip}} engine was used until the 2006 model year by [[DaimlerChrysler]] in the [[Jeep Wrangler]]. AMC's technologically advanced Bramalea Assembly and Stamping Plants in [[Brampton]], Ontario, later produced the [[Chrysler LX platform|LX-cars]] \u2013 the [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Dodge Charger]] and the [[Chrysler 300]], and the now discontinued [[Dodge Magnum]].\n\nIn terms of AMC-related parts, some were used as late as 2006, when the [[Jeep Wrangler]] (the last new product introduced by AMC before the Chrysler deal) was still using the [[AMC Straight-6 engine]] in some models, as well as the recessed \"paddle\" door handles that were used since the 1968 model year by AMC. Both were retired when the Wrangler was completely redesigned for the 2007 model year.\n\n[[AM General]], sold by American Motors in 1982, is still in business building the American Motors-designed [[Humvee]] for American and allied militaries. AM General also built the now-discontinued civilian variant \u2013 the H1 \u2013 and manufactured a [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]-derived companion, the H2, under contract to GM, who acquired the rights to the civilian Hummer brand in 1999. GM was forced to phase out the Hummer brand in early 2010 as a part of its bankruptcy restructuring after offering it for sale, but failing to find a suitable buyer.\n\nAlthough Chrysler introduced new logos for its brands in the 1990s and again in 2010 after the [[Fiat]] Group took control of the company, Jeep still uses the AMC-era logo introduced shortly after AMC's purchase of the brand in 1970. Until the Chrysler purchase, Jeep's logo also featured the AMC emblem.\n\n== International legacy ==\n\nBeginning in 1960, AMC's executive vice president of international operations Roy D. Chapin Jr., embarked on a strong international campaign to set up importation and local assembly operations of AMC vehicles around the world.\n\nOver the next few years, Chapin was successful in establishing or re-establishing vehicle assembly operations in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]] (via Renault of France), [[Costa Rica]], [[Germany]], [[Iran]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Venezuela]]. He also strengthened import operations into the [[United Kingdom]], which had already a long history of importing and assembling Hudson and Essex/[[Terraplane]] motor vehicles prior to the merger. The Rambler Classic would even become the basis of Argentina's future national car, the [[IKA-Renault Torino|Torino]]. With AMC's acquisition of Jeep in 1970, AMC inherited all existing international Jeep operations which helped sustain AMC during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nWhile the Rambler marque had been dropped in the United States after 1967, all export markets retained the Rambler name, with the longest to retain it being Mexico up until 1983.\n\n'''Argentina'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Ambassador, Classic'' (from 1964), ''Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Ambassador, Classic'' (1962-1963)<ref>http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm</ref>\n\n'''Australia'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Ambassador'' (1961-1963), ''Classic, American, Rebel'' (sedan and wagon), ''Matador'' (sedan and wagon), ''Javelin, AMX'' (1969 model only), ''Hornet'' (sedan), ''Matador Coupe X, Jeep'' (1980-1984.)<ref>https://cj3b.info/World/AustraliaHistory.html</ref> \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Classic'' (hardtop), ''Ambassador'' (1970 only.)\n\n'''Canada'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six'' (1957 only), ''Classic, American, Ambassador, Rebel, Hornet, Gremlin, Concord, Jeep, Eagle, Spirit.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Metropolitan'' (from U.K), ''Matador, Javelin, AMX.''\n\n'''Costa Rica'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Classic'' (from 1965), ''American'' (from 1965), ''Ambassador'' (from 1965), ''Rebel, Matador, Javelin, Hornet, Sportabout, Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Ambassador'' (until 1965), ''Classic'' (until 1965), ''American'' (until 1965.)\n\n'''France''' (Belgium)\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Classic, Rebel'' (1967 only.)\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Pacer.''\n\n'''Germany'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Javelin.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''Iran'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''American, Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''Mexico'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Ambassador'' (1959 only), ''American, Classic, Rebel'' (sedan), ''Matador, Javelin, AMX, Hornet, Matador Coupe X, Gremlin, Pacer, Spirit, Jeep.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six'' (1957-1958), ''Rambler V8'' (1957-1958.)\n\n'''New Zealand'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Classic, Rebel'' (sedan), ''Jeep.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Metropolitan, Rebel'' (wagon), ''Rebel'' (hardtop), ''Ambassador'' (1970 only.)\n\n'''Philippines'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Classic, American, Javelin.'' \n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''South Africa'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''American, Hornet\u2019\u2019<ref>http://motor-assemblies.blogspot.com/2012/01/motor-assemblies-limited.html?m=1#appendixb</ref>\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''Venezuela'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Javelin, Jeep.''\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''N/A.''\n\n'''United Kingdom'''\n*AMC vehicles assembled: ''Metropolitan'' (by Austin.)\n*AMC vehicles imported: ''Rambler Six, Rambler V8, Classic, Rebel, Ambassador, Matador, Javelin, Pacer'' (locally converted to RHD), ''Gremlin'' (locally converted to RHD.)\n\n== Legacy of divisions and facilities ==\n\n=== Former divisions ===\nDuring its history, American Motors bought or created, then later sold and divested itself of several specialized divisions, some which continue to exist today:\n\n''[[Kelvinator]]'', the subdivision of Nash-Kelvinator, was sold by American Motors in 1968 to [[White Sewing Machine Company|White Consolidated Industries]] and subsequently became part of [[Electrolux]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.chhistory.org/FeatureStories.php?Story=KelvinHome |last=Hubbert |first=Christopher J. |title=The Kelvin Home: Cleveland Heights Leads the Way to: 'a New and Better Way of Living |publisher=Cleveland Heights Historical Society |year=2006 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}</ref> The Kelvinator Company is still in business.\n\n''[[Jeep]]'' is now a brand of the [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].

In the early years, [[Ford Motor Company]] contracted the plant for a steady supply of engine casting blocks. This factory had a reputation locally as a dirty, dangerous place to work. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, AMC contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply AMC with [[cylinder block]] castings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/my/HolmesFoundry/|title=Holmes Foundry: Sarnia, Ontario|publisher=Holmes Foundry|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966.

Chrysler later decided to dispose of the factory. Upon closure, the site was named as a Superfund site. The factory was demolished and the site rehabilitated and redeveloped.\n* '''Danforth Ave (Toronto, Ontario) Plant''' \u2013 Inherited from Nash. This plant was purchased by Nash from Ford of Canada in 1946. The first Canadian-built Nash rolled off the line in April, 1950. Upon the formation of American Motors in 1954, the plant assembled 1955 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Ramblers]] (2- and 4-door sedans); as well as [[Nash Statesman|Nash Canadian Statesman]] and [[Hudson Wasp]] (4 door sedans). In 1956, the plant continued to assemble Nash and Hudson Rambler (4-door sedans and wagons) and the Nash Canadian Statesman (4-door sedan); but The Hudson Wasp was imported. That same year, American Motors Sales (Canada) Limited was formed \u2013 taking over Nash Motors of Canada Limited and Hudson Motors of Canada Limited. In 1957, AMC assembled the [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel]] V8 at the Danforth plant; but in July 1957, AMC closed the plant and imported Ramblers into Canada until 1961. The structure remains today as the [[Shoppers World Danforth]] [[Lowe's]] store.\n* '''[[Tilbury, Ontario]] Assembly Plant''' \u2013 Another plant AMC inherited from the 1954 merger; this one via Hudson. Specifically, it was a contract with CHATCO Steel Products which actually owned the plant. American Motors ceased Hudson production at the Tilbury plant in 1955.\n* '''Brampton Assembly Plant''' \u2013 AMC opened a plant in 1960 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. It was part of American Motors Canada, Inc. Rambler Drive, a small street just west of this plant, still exists and leads into a residential subdivision that was built in the 1960s. In 1987, with the Chrysler buyout, the division and the plant were absorbed as well, becoming part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant was closed in 1994 and sold to Wal-Mart for use as their Canadian warehouse. This plant/warehouse was demolished in 2004 and redeveloped in 2007 with multiple smaller commercial buildings now onsite; a new Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse now takes up the largest section of this commercial development.

KU is one of three schools [[List of college athletic programs in Kansas|in the state of Kansas]] that participate in [[NCAA Division I]]. The Jayhawks are also a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. KU [[college athletics|athletic]] teams have won eleven NCAA Division I championships: three in men's basketball, one in men's cross country, three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, and one in women's outdoor track and field.\n\nThe name \"Jayhawks\" comes from the Kansas [[Jayhawker]] freedom fighter and anti-slavery movement during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] era of the American Civil War.\n\n==Origins of \"Jayhawk\"==\n{{main|Jayhawker}}\n\nThe origin of the term \"Jayhawk\" (short for \"Jayhawker\") is uncertain. The origin of the term may go back as far as the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], when it was reportedly used to describe a group associated with American patriot [[John Jay]].<ref>''[[The Daily Cleveland Herald]]'', (Cleveland, Ohio) Saturday, December 21, 1861. Issue 301; column B</ref>\n\nThe term became part of the lexicon of the Missouri-Kansas border in about 1858, during the [[Kansas Territory|Kansas territorial]] period. The term was used to describe militant bands nominally associated with the free-state cause. One early Kansas history contained this succinct characterization of the jayhawkers:<ref>Spring, Leverett Wilson. ''Kansas, The Prelude to the War for the Union''. New York: Boston Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1896</ref>\n\n{{quote|Confederated at first for defense against pro-slavery outrages, but ultimately falling more or less completely into the vocation of robbers and assassins, they have received the name \u2013 whatever its origin may be \u2013 of jayhawkers.}}\n\nAnother historian of the territorial period described the jayhawkers as bands of men that were willing to fight, kill, and rob for a variety of motives that included defense against pro-slavery \"Border Ruffians\", abolition, driving pro-[[slavery]] settlers from their claims of land, revenge, and/or plunder and personal profit.<ref>Welch, G. Murlin. ''Border Warfare in Southeast Kansas: 1856\u20131859''. Linn County Publishing Co., Inc. 1977.</ref>\n\nIn September 1861, the town of [[Osceola, Missouri]] was burned to the ground by Jayhawkers during the [[Sacking of Osceola]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brennan|first=Eamonn|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/35412/the-dark-side-of-the-jayhawks-nickname|title=The dark side of the Jayhawks' nickname \u2013 College Basketball Nation Blog \u2013 ESPN|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-09-15|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> On the 150th anniversary of that event in 2011, the town asked the [[University of Kansas]] to remove the Jayhawk as its mascot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.columbiatribune.com/news/local/osceola-urges-kansas-to-drop-jayhawk-name/article_ab835903-4a8c-55aa-b4d7-6cef0b4a075b.html|title=Osceola urges Kansas to drop Jayhawk name|work=Columbia Daily Tribune|access-date=2013-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227092154/http://m.columbiatribune.com/news/local/osceola-urges-kansas-to-drop-jayhawk-name/article_ab835903-4a8c-55aa-b4d7-6cef0b4a075b.html|archive-date=2014-12-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The university refused.\n\nOver time, proud of their state's contributions to the end of slavery and the preservation of the Union, Kansans embraced the \"Jayhawker\" term. The term came to be applied to people or items related to Kansas. When the University of Kansas fielded their first football team in 1890, like many universities at that time, they had no official mascot. They used many different independent mascots, including a pig. Eventually, sometime during the 1890s, the team was referred to as the Jayhawkers by the student body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|title=The Jayhawk \u2022 The University of Kansas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115223928/http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|archivedate=2012-11-15}}</ref> Over time, the name was gradually supplanted by its shorter variant, and KU's sports teams are now almost exclusively known as the Jayhawks. The Jayhawk appears in several Kansas cheers, most notably, the \"[[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk]]\" chant in unison before and during games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/chant.shtml|title=Traditions \u2022 About KU \u2022 The University of Kansas|publisher=Ku.edu|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> In the traditions promoted by KU, the jayhawk is said to be a combination of two birds, \"the blue jay, a noisy, quarrelsome thing known to rob other nests, and the sparrow hawk, a stealthy hunter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2006-03-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115223928/http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|archivedate=2012-11-15}}. Accessed 1/28/11.</ref>\n\nThe link between the term \"Jayhawkers\" and any specific kind of mythical bird, if it ever existed, had been lost or at least obscured by the time KU's bird mascot was invented in 1912. The originator of the bird mascot, Henry Maloy, struggled for over two years to create a pictorial symbol for the team, until hitting upon the bird idea. As explained by Mr. Maloy, \"the term \u2018jayhawk\u2019 in the school yell was a verb and the term \u2018jayhawkers\u2019 was the noun.\"<ref>Kirke Mechem. The Mythical Jayhawk. Kansas Historical Quarterly, February 1944 (Vol. 13, No. 1), pages 1 to 15.</ref> KU's current Jayhawk tradition largely springs from Frank W. Blackmar, a KU professor. In his 1926 address on the origin of the Jayhawk, Blackmar specifically referenced the blue jay and sparrow hawk. Blackmar's address served to soften the link between KU's athletic team moniker and the Jayhawkers of the Kansas territorial period, and helped explain the relatively recently invented Jayhawk pictorial symbol with a myth that appears to have been of even more recent fabrication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.union.ku.edu/legend.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902021658/http://www.union.ku.edu/legend.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-09-02|title=KU History and Traditions \u2013 The Legend of the Jayhawk \u2013 Origin of the Jayhawk|last1=Blackmar|first1=Dr. F.

In the opening year of the war, six Missouri towns (the largest being [[Osceola, Missouri|Osceola]]) and large swaths of the western Missouri country side were plundered and burned by guerrilla \"Jayhawkers\" from Kansas. The [[Sacking of Osceola]] led to a retaliatory raid on Lawrence, Kansas two years later known as the [[Lawrence Massacre]] killing between 185 and 200 men and boys, which in turn led to the infamous [[General Order No. 11 (1863)]], the forced depopulation of several western Missouri counties.<ref name=Spurgeon>Spurgeon, Ian (2009), ''Man of Douglas, man of Lincoln: the political odyssey of James Henry Lane'', University of Missouri Press, pp. 185\u201388</ref> The raid on Lawrence was led by [[William Quantrill]], a Confederate guerrilla born in Ohio who had formed his [[bushwhacker]] group at the end of 1861. At the time the Civil War broke out, Quantrill was a resident of Lawrence, Kansas teaching school.<ref>Petersen, Paul R. (2003), ''Quantrill of Missouri: The Making of a Guerrilla Warrior \u2013 The Man, the Myth, the Soldier'',</ref>\n\nThe athletic rivalry began with a football game on October 31, 1891. Currently it is the second longest played series in Division I football and has been described as one of the most intense in the nation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/the_bonus/11/20/kansas.mizzou/|work=CNN|title=SI.com \u2013 The Border War \u2013 Nov 23, 2007|date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> However, no regular season games were scheduled after Missouri accepted an offer to join the [[Southeastern Conference]] and Kansas refused Missouri's offer to continue rivalry outside of the conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/7199062/missouri-tigers-move-sec-official-big-12-hurdles-remain|title=Missouri Tigers' move to SEC official, but Big 12 hurdles remain \u2013 ESPN|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-11-07|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The Jayhawks and Tigers have met in post-season in some sports following their departure for the SEC, but regular season games continue to not be scheduled. The schools' men's basketball teams met in 2017 for an exhibition game with the proceeds being donated to [[Hurricane Harvey]] relief funds. In the basketball series Kansas leads by a large margin (172-95 KU), in football Missouri leads by a very small margin (56-55-9 MU) and baseball Missouri leads by a large margin.\n\n====Nebraska Cornhuskers====\n{{main|Kansas-Nebraska football rivalry}}\nKansas had a rivalry with the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]], though that rivalry had more to do with who had the better sports program, with Kansas priding itself on its basketball prowess and Nebraska on its football dominance. This rivalry of sports cultures has gone dormant with Nebraska's departure for the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 2011. Prior to 2011, the football series between the 2 schools was the 3rd most played rivalry in college football behind Minnesota-Wisconsin and Kansas-Missouri.

KU is one of three schools [[List of college athletic programs in Kansas|in the state of Kansas]] that participate in [[NCAA Division I]]. The Jayhawks are also a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. KU [[college athletics|athletic]] teams have won eleven NCAA Division I championships: three in men's basketball, one in men's cross country, three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, and one in women's outdoor track and field.\n\nThe name \"Jayhawks\" comes from the Kansas [[Jayhawker]] freedom fighter and anti-slavery movement during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] era of the American Civil War.\n\n==Origins of \"Jayhawk\"==\n{{main|Jayhawker}}\n\nThe origin of the term \"Jayhawk\" (short for \"Jayhawker\") is uncertain. The origin of the term may go back as far as the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], when it was reportedly used to describe a group associated with American patriot [[John Jay]].<ref>''[[The Daily Cleveland Herald]]'', (Cleveland, Ohio) Saturday, December 21, 1861. Issue 301; column B</ref>\n\nThe term became part of the lexicon of the Missouri-Kansas border in about 1858, during the [[Kansas Territory|Kansas territorial]] period. The term was used to describe militant bands nominally associated with the free-state cause. One early Kansas history contained this succinct characterization of the jayhawkers:<ref>Spring, Leverett Wilson. ''Kansas, The Prelude to the War for the Union''. New York: Boston Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1896</ref>\n\n{{quote|Confederated at first for defense against pro-slavery outrages, but ultimately falling more or less completely into the vocation of robbers and assassins, they have received the name \u2013 whatever its origin may be \u2013 of jayhawkers.}}\n\nAnother historian of the territorial period described the jayhawkers as bands of men that were willing to fight, kill, and rob for a variety of motives that included defense against pro-slavery \"Border Ruffians\", abolition, driving pro-[[slavery]] settlers from their claims of land, revenge, and/or plunder and personal profit.<ref>Welch, G. Murlin. ''Border Warfare in Southeast Kansas: 1856\u20131859''. Linn County Publishing Co., Inc. 1977.</ref>\n\nIn September 1861, the town of [[Osceola, Missouri]] was burned to the ground by Jayhawkers during the [[Sacking of Osceola]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brennan|first=Eamonn|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/35412/the-dark-side-of-the-jayhawks-nickname|title=The dark side of the Jayhawks' nickname \u2013 College Basketball Nation Blog \u2013 ESPN|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-09-15|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> On the 150th anniversary of that event in 2011, the town asked the [[University of Kansas]] to remove the Jayhawk as its mascot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.columbiatribune.com/news/local/osceola-urges-kansas-to-drop-jayhawk-name/article_ab835903-4a8c-55aa-b4d7-6cef0b4a075b.html|title=Osceola urges Kansas to drop Jayhawk name|work=Columbia Daily Tribune|access-date=2013-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227092154/http://m.columbiatribune.com/news/local/osceola-urges-kansas-to-drop-jayhawk-name/article_ab835903-4a8c-55aa-b4d7-6cef0b4a075b.html|archive-date=2014-12-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The university refused.\n\nOver time, proud of their state's contributions to the end of slavery and the preservation of the Union, Kansans embraced the \"Jayhawker\" term. The term came to be applied to people or items related to Kansas. When the University of Kansas fielded their first football team in 1890, like many universities at that time, they had no official mascot. They used many different independent mascots, including a pig. Eventually, sometime during the 1890s, the team was referred to as the Jayhawkers by the student body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|title=The Jayhawk \u2022 The University of Kansas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115223928/http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|archivedate=2012-11-15}}</ref> Over time, the name was gradually supplanted by its shorter variant, and KU's sports teams are now almost exclusively known as the Jayhawks. The Jayhawk appears in several Kansas cheers, most notably, the \"[[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk]]\" chant in unison before and during games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/chant.shtml|title=Traditions \u2022 About KU \u2022 The University of Kansas|publisher=Ku.edu|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> In the traditions promoted by KU, the jayhawk is said to be a combination of two birds, \"the blue jay, a noisy, quarrelsome thing known to rob other nests, and the sparrow hawk, a stealthy hunter.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2006-03-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115223928/http://www.ku.edu/about/traditions/jayhawk.shtml|archivedate=2012-11-15}}. Accessed 1/28/11.</ref>\n\nThe link between the term \"Jayhawkers\" and any specific kind of mythical bird, if it ever existed, had been lost or at least obscured by the time KU's bird mascot was invented in 1912. The originator of the bird mascot, Henry Maloy, struggled for over two years to create a pictorial symbol for the team, until hitting upon the bird idea. As explained by Mr. Maloy, \"the term \u2018jayhawk\u2019 in the school yell was a verb and the term \u2018jayhawkers\u2019 was the noun.\"<ref>Kirke Mechem. The Mythical Jayhawk. Kansas Historical Quarterly, February 1944 (Vol. 13, No. 1), pages 1 to 15.</ref> KU's current Jayhawk tradition largely springs from Frank W. Blackmar, a KU professor. In his 1926 address on the origin of the Jayhawk, Blackmar specifically referenced the blue jay and sparrow hawk. Blackmar's address served to soften the link between KU's athletic team moniker and the Jayhawkers of the Kansas territorial period, and helped explain the relatively recently invented Jayhawk pictorial symbol with a myth that appears to have been of even more recent fabrication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.union.ku.edu/legend.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902021658/http://www.union.ku.edu/legend.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-09-02|title=KU History and Traditions \u2013 The Legend of the Jayhawk \u2013 Origin of the Jayhawk|last1=Blackmar|first1=Dr. F.

In the opening year of the war, six Missouri towns (the largest being [[Osceola, Missouri|Osceola]]) and large swaths of the western Missouri country side were plundered and burned by guerrilla \"Jayhawkers\" from Kansas. The [[Sacking of Osceola]] led to a retaliatory raid on Lawrence, Kansas two years later known as the [[Lawrence Massacre]] killing between 185 and 200 men and boys, which in turn led to the infamous [[General Order No. 11 (1863)]], the forced depopulation of several western Missouri counties.<ref name=Spurgeon>Spurgeon, Ian (2009), ''Man of Douglas, man of Lincoln: the political odyssey of James Henry Lane'', University of Missouri Press, pp. 185\u201388</ref> The raid on Lawrence was led by [[William Quantrill]], a Confederate guerrilla born in Ohio who had formed his [[bushwhacker]] group at the end of 1861. At the time the Civil War broke out, Quantrill was a resident of Lawrence, Kansas teaching school.<ref>Petersen, Paul R. (2003), ''Quantrill of Missouri: The Making of a Guerrilla Warrior \u2013 The Man, the Myth, the Soldier'',</ref>\n\nThe athletic rivalry began with a football game on October 31, 1891. Currently it is the second longest played series in Division I football and has been described as one of the most intense in the nation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/the_bonus/11/20/kansas.mizzou/|work=CNN|title=SI.com \u2013 The Border War \u2013 Nov 23, 2007|date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> However, no regular season games were scheduled after Missouri accepted an offer to join the [[Southeastern Conference]] and Kansas refused Missouri's offer to continue rivalry outside of the conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/7199062/missouri-tigers-move-sec-official-big-12-hurdles-remain|title=Missouri Tigers' move to SEC official, but Big 12 hurdles remain \u2013 ESPN|publisher=Espn.go.com|date=2011-11-07|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The Jayhawks and Tigers have met in post-season in some sports following their departure for the SEC, but regular season games continue to not be scheduled. The schools' men's basketball teams met in 2017 for an exhibition game with the proceeds being donated to [[Hurricane Harvey]] relief funds. In the basketball series Kansas leads by a large margin (172-95 KU), in football Missouri leads by a very small margin (56-55-9 MU) and baseball Missouri leads by a large margin.\n\n====Nebraska Cornhuskers====\n{{main|Kansas-Nebraska football rivalry}}\nKansas had a rivalry with the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]], though that rivalry had more to do with who had the better sports program, with Kansas priding itself on its basketball prowess and Nebraska on its football dominance. This rivalry of sports cultures has gone dormant with Nebraska's departure for the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 2011. Prior to 2011, the football series between the 2 schools was the 3rd most played rivalry in college football behind Minnesota-Wisconsin and Kansas-Missouri.

They were in service from March to August 1918. When the guns were first employed, Parisians believed they had been bombed by a high-altitude [[Zeppelin]], as the sound of neither an aeroplane nor a gun could be heard. They were the largest pieces of artillery used during the war by barrel length, and qualify under the (later) formal definition of [[large-calibre artillery]].\n\nAlso called the \"''Kaiser Wilhelm Gesch\u00fctz''\" (\"[[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor William]] Gun\"), they were often confused with [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]], the German [[howitzer]] used against the [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] forts in 1914; indeed, the French called them by this name, as well.<ref group=\"Note\">For an instance of war-time naming of this gun as \"Big Bertha\", see {{cite news | title = Paris again Shelled by Long-Range Gun | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 6, 1918 | page = 3 | format = PDF | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/06/97014230.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"ley196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=Dragons and Hot-Air Balloons\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n9/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=79\u201389\n |type=\n}}</ref> They were also confused with the smaller \"[[Langer Max]]\" (Long Max) cannon, from which they were derived; although the famous [[Krupp]]-family artillery makers produced all these guns, the resemblance ended there.\n\nAs military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns' accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:George Eastman House - Bouvigny (French) - Emplacement d-une Bertha (pd).jpg|thumb|A Paris gun turntable mounting, as captured by United States forces near Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, 1918 postcard]]\nDue to the weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans in the face of the final Allied offensives, its capabilities are not known with full certainty. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source\u2014not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.\n\nThe gun was capable of firing a {{convert|106|kg|adj=on}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} shell to a range of {{convert|130|km|mi|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|42.3|km|sp=us}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}\u2014the greatest height reached by a human-made [[projectile]] until the first successful [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] flight test in October 1942. At the start of its 182-second trajectory,<ref name=bull />{{rp|33}} each shell from the Paris Gun reached a speed of {{convert|1640|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"bull\" />{{rp|33}} or {{Convert|5924|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nSeven barrels were constructed. They used worn-out [[38 cm SK L/45 \"Max\"]] gun barrels that were fitted with an internal tube that reduced the caliber from {{Convert|380|mm|in|0|sp=us}} to {{Convert|210|mm|in|0|sp=us}}. The tube was {{Convert|21|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long and projected {{Convert|3.9|m|ft|0|sp=us}} out of the end of the gun, so an extension was bolted to the old gun-muzzle to cover and reinforce the lining tube. A further, 12-meter\u2013long smooth-bore extension was attached to the end of this, giving a total barrel length of {{Convert|34|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|84}} This smooth section was intended to improve accuracy and reduce the dispersion of the shells, as it reduced the slight [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] a shell might have immediately after leaving the gun barrel produced by the gun's [[rifling]].<ref name=\"miller737\">Miller (1921) pg.737</ref> The barrel was braced to counteract barrel drop due to its length and weight, and vibrations while firing; it was mounted on a special rail-transportable carriage and fired from a prepared, concrete emplacement with a turntable. The original breech of the old 38&nbsp;cm gun did not require modification or reinforcement.\n\nSince it was based on a naval weapon, the gun was manned by a crew of 80 [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] sailors under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Rogge, chief of the Ordnance branch of the Admiralty.<ref name=bull />{{rp|66}} It was surrounded by several batteries of standard army artillery to create a \"noise-screen\" chorus around the big gun so that it could not be located by French and British spotters.\n\nThe projectile was flying significantly higher than projectiles from previous guns. Writer and journalist [[Adam Hochschild]] put it this way: \"It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of {{convert|25|mi}} at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere\".<ref>''To End All Wars'' by Adam Hochschild c. 2011 Adam Hochschild(Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company New York; 2011) pp.320 - 321</ref> This reduced drag from air resistance, allowing the shell to achieve a range of over {{Convert|130|km}}.\n\nThe unfinished [[V-3 cannon]] would have been able to fire larger projectiles to a longer range, and with a substantially higher rate of fire. The unfinished [[Project Babylon|Iraqi super gun]] would also have been substantially bigger.\n\n==Projectiles==\n[[File:Miller Paris Gun Shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Post-war diagram of a Paris gun shell<ref>Miller (1921) pg.742</ref>]]\nThe Paris Gun [[shell (projectile)|shells]] weighed {{convert|106|kg|abbr=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The shells initially used had a diameter of {{convert|216|mm|abbr=on}} and a length of  {{convert|960|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The main body of the shell was composed of thick steel, containing {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} of [[TNT]].<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}<ref group=\"Note\">This overall weight of Paris Gun shells is not atypical for artillery of this calibre. As a comparison, World War 1-era,  British [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI \u2013 VIII|BL 8-inch howitzer]] fired a {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}} high-explosive shell. The 210&nbsp;mm shell fired by the World War 2-era [[21 cm Kanone 39]] weighed {{convert|135|kg|abbr=on}} and contained {{convert|18.8|kg|abbr=on}} of explosives (13.9% by weight).</ref> The small amount of explosive \u2013 around 6.6% of the weight of the shell \u2013 meant that the effect of its shellburst was small for the shell's size.<ref name=Maitland>{{cite journal | author=Major J.

Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of {{convert|238|mm|abbr=on}} with a new set of shells.\n\nThe shell's explosive was contained in two compartments, separated by a wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuzes was mounted in the wall, with the other in the base of the shell. The fuzes proved very reliable as every single one of the 303 shells that landed in and around Paris successfully detonated.<ref>Miller (1921) pg.744</ref> The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap \u2013 a highly unusual feature for the time \u2013 and the side had grooves that engaged with the [[rifling]] of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper [[driving band]]s provided a gas-tight seal against the gun barrel during firing.<ref name=Maitland />\n\n==Use in World War I==\n{{Location map+|France|float=right|width=200|alt=A map of France|caption=Location map|places=\n{{Location map~|France|lat=49.5|long=3.3|position=top|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: -0.1em; right: -1.4em;\">Gun Site</div>}}\n{{Location map~|France|lat=48.85|long=2.35|position=left|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: 1.0em; left: -0.5em;\">Paris</div>}}}}\n[[File:Paris Gun Shellls 1918.png|thumb|Map of central districts of Paris, showing where shells fired by the Paris Gun landed, June-August 1918, and a line indicating the direction of the German gun.

By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new long-range gun, although there was initially press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun.<ref name=\"miller723\" /> The actual gun was found within days by the French air reconnaissance<ref name=\"miller728\">Miller (1921) pg.728</ref> aviator [[Didier Daurat]].\n\nThe Paris gun emplacement was dug out of the north side of the wooded hill at [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique]].<ref group=\"Note\">Position {{coord|49|31|40.43|N|3|18|17.57|E}}</ref> The gun was mounted on heavy steel rails embedded in concrete, facing Paris.\n\nThe Paris gun was used to shell Paris at a range of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The distance was so far that the [[Coriolis effect]]\u2014the rotation of the Earth\u2014was substantial enough to affect trajectory calculations. The gun was fired at an azimuth of 232 degrees (west-southwest) from Cr\u00e9py-en-Laon, which was at a latitude of 49.5 degrees north.\n\nBetween 320 and 367 shells were fired, at a maximum rate of around 20 per day. The shells killed 250 people and wounded 620, and caused considerable damage to property.  The worst incident was on 29 March 1918, when a single shell hit the roof of the [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]], collapsing the roof on to the congregation then hearing the Good Friday service.  A total of 91 people were killed and 68 were wounded.\n\nThe gun was taken back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied advances threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that near the end of the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by American troops in Bruy\u00e8res-sur-F\u00e8re, near [[Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]], but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n44hAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA937&ots=vLkDBl-s4n&dq=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&pg=PA937#v=onepage&q=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&f=false|title=Columbia Alumni News|last=|first=|publisher=Alumni Council of Columbia University (Vol. 10, No. 30)|year=1918|isbn=|location=|pages=937|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==After World War I==\n[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 railway gun]] elevated to the firing position]]\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the Germans were required to turn over a complete Paris Gun to the Allies, but they never complied with this.<ref name=\"Venzon2013\">{{cite book|author=Anne Cipriano Venzon|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA436|date=2 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-68446-4|pages=436}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, the German Army became interested in rockets for long-range artillery as a replacement for the Paris Gun\u2014which was specifically banned under the [[Versailles Treaty]]. This work would eventually led to the [[V-2 rocket]] that was used in [[World War II]].\n\nDespite the ban, Krupp continued theoretical work on long-range guns. They started experimental work after the Nazi government began funding the project upon coming to power in 1933. This research led to the [[21 cm K 12 (E)]], a refinement of the Paris Gun design concept.<ref>Ford (2000), p.116</ref> Although it was broadly similar in size and range to its predecessor, Krupp's engineers had significantly reduced the problem of barrel wear. They also improved mobility over the fixed Paris Gun by making the K12 a [[railway gun]].\n\nThe first K12 was delivered to the German Army in 1939 and a second in 1940. During World War II, they were deployed in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France; they were used to shell [[Kent]] in Southern England between late 1940 and early 1941.

They were the largest pieces of artillery used during the war by barrel length, and qualify under the (later) formal definition of [[large-calibre artillery]].\n\nAlso called the \"''Kaiser Wilhelm Gesch\u00fctz''\" (\"[[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor William]] Gun\"), they were often confused with [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]], the German [[howitzer]] used against the [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] forts in 1914; indeed, the French called them by this name, as well.<ref group=\"Note\">For an instance of war-time naming of this gun as \"Big Bertha\", see {{cite news | title = Paris again Shelled by Long-Range Gun | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 6, 1918 | page = 3 | format = PDF | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/06/97014230.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"ley196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=Dragons and Hot-Air Balloons\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n9/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=79\u201389\n |type=\n}}</ref> They were also confused with the smaller \"[[Langer Max]]\" (Long Max) cannon, from which they were derived; although the famous [[Krupp]]-family artillery makers produced all these guns, the resemblance ended there.\n\nAs military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns' accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:George Eastman House - Bouvigny (French) - Emplacement d-une Bertha (pd).jpg|thumb|A Paris gun turntable mounting, as captured by United States forces near Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, 1918 postcard]]\nDue to the weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans in the face of the final Allied offensives, its capabilities are not known with full certainty. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source\u2014not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.\n\nThe gun was capable of firing a {{convert|106|kg|adj=on}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} shell to a range of {{convert|130|km|mi|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|42.3|km|sp=us}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}\u2014the greatest height reached by a human-made [[projectile]] until the first successful [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] flight test in October 1942. At the start of its 182-second trajectory,<ref name=bull />{{rp|33}} each shell from the Paris Gun reached a speed of {{convert|1640|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"bull\" />{{rp|33}} or {{Convert|5924|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nSeven barrels were constructed. They used worn-out [[38 cm SK L/45 \"Max\"]] gun barrels that were fitted with an internal tube that reduced the caliber from {{Convert|380|mm|in|0|sp=us}} to {{Convert|210|mm|in|0|sp=us}}. The tube was {{Convert|21|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long and projected {{Convert|3.9|m|ft|0|sp=us}} out of the end of the gun, so an extension was bolted to the old gun-muzzle to cover and reinforce the lining tube. A further, 12-meter\u2013long smooth-bore extension was attached to the end of this, giving a total barrel length of {{Convert|34|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|84}} This smooth section was intended to improve accuracy and reduce the dispersion of the shells, as it reduced the slight [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] a shell might have immediately after leaving the gun barrel produced by the gun's [[rifling]].<ref name=\"miller737\">Miller (1921) pg.737</ref> The barrel was braced to counteract barrel drop due to its length and weight, and vibrations while firing; it was mounted on a special rail-transportable carriage and fired from a prepared, concrete emplacement with a turntable. The original breech of the old 38&nbsp;cm gun did not require modification or reinforcement.\n\nSince it was based on a naval weapon, the gun was manned by a crew of 80 [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] sailors under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Rogge, chief of the Ordnance branch of the Admiralty.<ref name=bull />{{rp|66}} It was surrounded by several batteries of standard army artillery to create a \"noise-screen\" chorus around the big gun so that it could not be located by French and British spotters.\n\nThe projectile was flying significantly higher than projectiles from previous guns. Writer and journalist [[Adam Hochschild]] put it this way: \"It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of {{convert|25|mi}} at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere\".<ref>''To End All Wars'' by Adam Hochschild c. 2011 Adam Hochschild(Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company New York; 2011) pp.320 - 321</ref> This reduced drag from air resistance, allowing the shell to achieve a range of over {{Convert|130|km}}.\n\nThe unfinished [[V-3 cannon]] would have been able to fire larger projectiles to a longer range, and with a substantially higher rate of fire. The unfinished [[Project Babylon|Iraqi super gun]] would also have been substantially bigger.\n\n==Projectiles==\n[[File:Miller Paris Gun Shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Post-war diagram of a Paris gun shell<ref>Miller (1921) pg.742</ref>]]\nThe Paris Gun [[shell (projectile)|shells]] weighed {{convert|106|kg|abbr=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The shells initially used had a diameter of {{convert|216|mm|abbr=on}} and a length of  {{convert|960|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The main body of the shell was composed of thick steel, containing {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} of [[TNT]].<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}<ref group=\"Note\">This overall weight of Paris Gun shells is not atypical for artillery of this calibre. As a comparison, World War 1-era,  British [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI \u2013 VIII|BL 8-inch howitzer]] fired a {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}} high-explosive shell. The 210&nbsp;mm shell fired by the World War 2-era [[21 cm Kanone 39]] weighed {{convert|135|kg|abbr=on}} and contained {{convert|18.8|kg|abbr=on}} of explosives (13.9% by weight).</ref> The small amount of explosive \u2013 around 6.6% of the weight of the shell \u2013 meant that the effect of its shellburst was small for the shell's size.<ref name=Maitland>{{cite journal | author=Major J.

Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of {{convert|238|mm|abbr=on}} with a new set of shells.\n\nThe shell's explosive was contained in two compartments, separated by a wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuzes was mounted in the wall, with the other in the base of the shell. The fuzes proved very reliable as every single one of the 303 shells that landed in and around Paris successfully detonated.<ref>Miller (1921) pg.744</ref> The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap \u2013 a highly unusual feature for the time \u2013 and the side had grooves that engaged with the [[rifling]] of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper [[driving band]]s provided a gas-tight seal against the gun barrel during firing.<ref name=Maitland />\n\n==Use in World War I==\n{{Location map+|France|float=right|width=200|alt=A map of France|caption=Location map|places=\n{{Location map~|France|lat=49.5|long=3.3|position=top|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: -0.1em; right: -1.4em;\">Gun Site</div>}}\n{{Location map~|France|lat=48.85|long=2.35|position=left|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: 1.0em; left: -0.5em;\">Paris</div>}}}}\n[[File:Paris Gun Shellls 1918.png|thumb|Map of central districts of Paris, showing where shells fired by the Paris Gun landed, June-August 1918, and a line indicating the direction of the German gun.

By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new long-range gun, although there was initially press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun.<ref name=\"miller723\" /> The actual gun was found within days by the French air reconnaissance<ref name=\"miller728\">Miller (1921) pg.728</ref> aviator [[Didier Daurat]].\n\nThe Paris gun emplacement was dug out of the north side of the wooded hill at [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique]].<ref group=\"Note\">Position {{coord|49|31|40.43|N|3|18|17.57|E}}</ref> The gun was mounted on heavy steel rails embedded in concrete, facing Paris.\n\nThe Paris gun was used to shell Paris at a range of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The distance was so far that the [[Coriolis effect]]\u2014the rotation of the Earth\u2014was substantial enough to affect trajectory calculations. The gun was fired at an azimuth of 232 degrees (west-southwest) from Cr\u00e9py-en-Laon, which was at a latitude of 49.5 degrees North.\n\nBetween 320 and 367 shells were fired, at a maximum rate of around 20 per day. The shells killed 250 people and wounded 620, and caused considerable damage to property.  The worst incident was on 29 March 1918, when a single shell hit the roof of the [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]], collapsing the roof on to the congregation then hearing the Good Friday service.  A total of 91 people were killed and 68 were wounded.\n\nThe gun was taken back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied advances threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that near the end of the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by American troops in Bruy\u00e8res-sur-F\u00e8re, near [[Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]], but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n44hAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA937&ots=vLkDBl-s4n&dq=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&pg=PA937#v=onepage&q=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&f=false|title=Columbia Alumni News|last=|first=|publisher=Alumni Council of Columbia University (Vol. 10, No. 30)|year=1918|isbn=|location=|pages=937|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==After World War I==\n[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 railway gun]] elevated to the firing position]]\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the Germans were required to turn over a complete Paris Gun to the Allies, but they never complied with this.<ref name=\"Venzon2013\">{{cite book|author=Anne Cipriano Venzon|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA436|date=2 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-68446-4|pages=436}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, the German Army became interested in rockets for long-range artillery as a replacement for the Paris Gun\u2014which was specifically banned under the [[Versailles Treaty]]. This work would eventually led to the [[V-2 rocket]] that was used in [[World War II]].\n\nDespite the ban, Krupp continued theoretical work on long-range guns. They started experimental work after the Nazi government began funding the project upon coming to power in 1933. This research led to the [[21 cm K 12 (E)]], a refinement of the Paris Gun design concept.<ref>Ford (2000), p.116</ref> Although it was broadly similar in size and range to its predecessor, Krupp's engineers had significantly reduced the problem of barrel wear. They also improved mobility over the fixed Paris Gun by making the K12 a [[railway gun]].\n\nThe first K12 was delivered to the German Army in 1939 and a second in 1940. During World War II, they were deployed in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France; they were used to shell [[Kent]] in Southern England between late 1940 and early 1941. One gun was captured by Allied forces in the Netherlands in 1945.<ref>Ford (2000), p.117</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Great Dictator - The Big Bertha - Cannon in the First World War.JPG|thumb|right|\"Big Bertha\" in the [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vance|first=Jeffrey|title=The Great Dictator|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/great_dictator.pdf|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=26 September 2018}}</ref>]]\n\nA parody of the Paris Gun appears in the [[Charlie Chaplin]] movie ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.
