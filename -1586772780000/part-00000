He rose rapidly in the royal service and was knighted in 1543.\n\nSir William Petre was adept at side-stepping the great religious controversies of the day; in January 1544 he was appointed Secretary of State.  He navigated the ship of state through the rest of Henry's troubled reign, managing a smooth succession in 1547.  He held high office throughout the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] until, owing to ill health he retired a rich man to his manor of [[Ingatestone]], in [[Essex]], where he had built [[Ingatestone Hall]]. His son was [[John Petre, 1st Baron Petre]] of Writtle, raised to the [[peerage]] in 1603. The later Barons Petre have mostly been [[Roman Catholic]]s.\n\nThe musician [[William Byrd]] wrote a [[Pavane|Pavan]] and a [[Galliard]] for Sir William Petre, which were published as part of his ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nBorn in about 1505 or 1506, Petre was the eldest son of John Petre of Tor Newton in the parish of [[Torbryan]], Devon, by his wife Alice Colling, daughter of John Colling of Woodland, Devon.<ref>[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L.]], (Ed.)

He received a [[Heraldry|grant of arms]] in 1573.<ref name=\"Vivian, p.592\"/>\n\n==Education==\nIn 1519 Petre matriculated at the [[University of Oxford]] as a law student. He is claimed as a member of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], of which he was later a benefactor, but there is no evidence of him there as an undergraduate. In 1523 he became a [[Fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], of which he was law bursar in 1528/9. On 2 July 1526 he graduated Bachelor of both laws, and in 1527 and 1528 practised as a lawyer in Oxford.{{sfn|Knighton|2004}}\n\n==Political life==\nPetre's career is strikingly similar to those of other statesmen of his time, such as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], [[John Mason (diplomat)|John Mason]], and [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich]], who, 'sprung from the willow rather than the oak', and served with equal fidelity Kings Henry, Edward and Queens Mary, and Elizabeth, surviving all contemporary political and religious storms. Among mid-Tudor privy councillors, Petre is unique in his unbroken service; he alone escaped execution, imprisonment in the Tower, house arrest, disgrace, fine, exile, or enforced retirement. As a diplomat, his manner was 'smooth, reserved, resolved, yet obliging'. At Boulogne in 1550, Chatillion said of Petre \"Ah, we had gained the last two hundred thousand crowns without hostages, had it not been for that man who said nothing\".\n\nIn his later years, he was said to be a Catholic, a creed to which his descendants have consistently adhered. Nevertheless, his piety was not uncompromising, and did not stand in the way of his temporal advancement. Though he was less rapacious than his colleagues in profiting by the fall of Somerset, Petre acquired enormous property by the dissolution of the monasteries; in Devonshire alone he is said to have secured {{convert|36000|acre|km2}}; but his principal seat was at [[Ingatestone]] which he received on the dissolution of the abbey of St. Mary's Barking.\n\nThough so occupied in politics, he seems to have been a man with wider interests, a considerable portion of his wealth was spent on charitable objects; he founded [[almshouses]] at [[Ingatestone]], and designed scholarships for [[All Souls College, Oxford]], but his chief benefactions were to [[Exeter College, Oxford]], and entitle him to be considered its second founder. In other ways, Petre was a patron of learning; his correspondence with English envoys abroad contains frequent requests for rare books. He was himself governor of [[King Edward VI Grammar School (Chelmsford)|Chelmsford grammar school]], and Ascham benefited by his favour, which he is said to have requited by dedicating to Petre his ''Osorius de Nobilitate Christiana''. A mass of Petre's correspondence has been summarised in the 'Calendars of State Papers', and many of the originals are in the Cottonian, Harleian, and Additional Manuscripts in the British Museum; his transcript of the notes for Edward VI's will is in the Inner Temple Library.\n\nWilliam was educated at the great [[West Country]] college of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]], at [[Oxford]], arriving there in 1520 when he was about 14 (the usual age at that time), from whence he was elected Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] in 1523 where he graduated Bachelor of Civil and Canon Law on 2 July 1526 (both colleges were generously endowed by him later). Proficient both in [[Roman law|Roman (administrative)]] and [[ecclesiastical law]], in about 1527, he became Principal of [[Peckwater's Inn]] or [[Vine Hall, Oxford|Vine Hall]], and tutor to [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]] (son of the [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Earl of Wiltshire]] and afterwards Viscount Rochford). It was no doubt through the influence of Boleyn's sister [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]] that Petre came to the notice of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] (she sent him presents, and promised him any pleasure it was in her power to give) and was introduced at court and selected for government service. He was sent abroad and resided on the continent, chiefly in France, for more than four years. On his return, he was appointed a [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Clerk in Chancery]] and All Souls made him Doctor of Civil Law on 17 February 1532.\n\nIn 1534, William and Edmund Walsingham examined Anne Husee on the charge of addressing Henry's daughter Mary as Princess when Anne had stayed with her at Hunsdon, and whether she thought her the lawful daughter of the king. Anne Husee, knowing her head to be in danger if she continued to support Mary, took the more prudent way and besought pardon. 'She most humbly beseecheth his Highness of mercy and forgiveness, as One that is repentant for that she hath so offended and purposeth never hereafter to fall in to semblable danger, \u2013 signed Anne Husee, countersigned Edmund Walsyngham. Per me Gulielmum Petre'.\n\nFrom his youth he must have been a capable, pushing, insinuating man. He was only about thirty when he was already in high favour with [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] and Cromwell, who spoke in November 1535 of making Petre dean of arches, there 'being no man more fit for it'.\n\nOn 13 January 1536, he was appointed deputy or proctor for Cromwell in his capacity as [[vicar general|Vicar-General]] and appointed [[Visitor]] of the greater monasteries in Kent and other southern counties, being especially active in the West Country. In the same year, he was made [[Court of Chancery|Master in Chancery]], was placed on a commission to receive and examine all bulls and briefs from Rome, and granted the [[prebendary|prebend]] of Langford Ecclesia in [[Lincoln Cathedral]], which he resigned the following year. On 16 June 1536, Petre appeared in Convocation and made a novel claim to preside over its deliberations, on the ground that the King was supreme head of the church, Cromwell was the King's vicegerent, and he was Cromwell's deputy. After some discussion, his claim was allowed. In 1537 was employed to examine [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] and other prisoners taken in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|Lincolnshire and Yorkshire rebellions]].\n\nSoon he was actively visiting and aiding in the suppression of the smaller monasteries, he was one of the most zealous of the visitors. Among the twenty monasteries he visited and procured the surrender of in 1538 were, perhaps, St. Leonard's, Thoby and [[Blackmore]]. In the first three months of 1539, thirteen more fell before him; he being instrumental in the almost total extirpation of the [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertines]], the only religious order of English origin. A few years later, he was Visitor of the greater monasteries in Kent and the South of England.\n\n===Secretary of State to Henry VIII===\nHis fortunes were linked with those of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[vicar general|Vicar General]]. In 1539, Petre was one of those appointed to prepare a bill for the enactment of 'The [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]]', and in the following year was on the commission that declared the nullity of Henry's marriage with [[Anne of Cleves]]. Early in 1543, he was knighted, appointed [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] in [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Wriothesley]]'s place and placed on various commissions to inquire into causes of supposed heresy. In 1544, Henry made William a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Councillor]], and on 9 July 1544, one of his two Principal Secretaries selected to assist [[Catherine Howard|Queen Catherine]] in carrying on the Regency in the small 'Regency Council' during Henry's absence, and to raise supplies for the King's expedition to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. In 1545, he was sent abroad as ambassador to the great [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], but at the end of the year was summoned back to the Privy Council.\n\nThough much occupied with public business, this astute politician found time and many opportunities to get and lay by great gain for himself. As one of the Visitors of the monasteries, he knew better than many people what properties were worth acquiring. He paid the King some \u00a3849 12s 6d (approximately \u00a3330,000 today) for the property known as \"Ginge Abbes\" at [[Ingatestone]], even though the King was trying to raise money and this was a \"fair\" price it is probably true Sir William got a bargain. Ingatestone, which had previously belonged to [[Barking Abbey]], must have been selected as being a particularly fertile and well-cultivated district at that period, within an easy ride of London, and with the comfortable house of the Abbess's steward, with its fish-ponds and park, easily turned into an excellent country residence for the busy statesman. Here, at [[Ingatestone Hall]], Sir William Petre established himself and his family, and many of his letters are dated from this place.\n\nHowever, there is some evidence of an institutionalised system of bribery and corruption. Those in public office were expected to charge for favours and salaries were accordingly set very low. Accounts show that by 1540, William was receiving \u00a3180 per year in annuities from religious houses he had visited (approximately \u00a370,000 today). It is strange that abbeys should give annuities to an individual charged with abolishing them; they were probably bribes either to delay the procedure or to facilitate a fat pension for the retiring Abbot. William received money from about twenty monasteries.\n\n===Secretary of State to Edward VI===\nWhen [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] died in 1547 William was appointed an assistant executor to his will. This gave him much hold over the Protestant and youthful sovereign, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], and his power, importance and activity rapidly increased. In August 1547, he was entrusted with the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] for use in all ecclesiastical affairs.\n\nIn 1547 he was first elected as [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]]. He was returned for Essex a further eight times in 1553 (twice), 1554 (twice), 1555, 1558, 1559 and 1563. He may have previously sat for [[Downton (UK Parliament constituency)|Downton]] in 1536.<ref name=history>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/petre-william-15056-72 Petre, William (1505/6-72), of Ingatestone, Essex and Aldersgate Street, London, History of Parliament] Retrieved 9 July 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1549, he served on commissions to visit the [[University of Oxford]] inquiring into heresies, to examine the charges against [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Lord Seymour of Sudeley]], and to try [[Edmund Bonner|Bonner]]. He did not take part in Bonner's trial after the first day, and it was rumoured that he 'was turning about to another party'. On 6 October 1549, he was sent by [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] to the council to demand the reason of their coming together, though at first a supporter of the Protector Somerset. Finding them the stronger party he deserted Somerset just before his fall, remaining to sign the council's letter to the lord mayor denouncing the protector; four days later he also signed the proclamation against Somerset.\n\nBy the 1550s, he was very prosperous. Not only was he Secretary of State but he also had many other sinecures such as warden of [[Bishop of Winchester]]'s lands. He enjoyed many rewards such as free board and lodging at court. In February 1550, he was sent to Boulogne to negotiate the terms of peace with France, and in the following May exchanged ratifications of it at [[Amiens]]. William Petre is described as smooth and obliging in manner, yet reserved and resolved, and not given to many words. In the same year, he was treasurer of [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths|First Fruits and Tenths]] and one of the commissioners to examine [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]]; he was also sent to [[Palace of Beaulieu|New Hall, Essex]], to request Mary to come to court or change her residence to Oking. William also writes in terms of friendship to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] in 1551, from Ingatestone, regretting to hear that Cecil is ill, thanking him for a book he had sent, and saying his little ones when they are able shall send him some proof of their progress; and writes again later to congratulate Cecil on his recovery.\n\nIn August 1551, Petre was one of those who communicated to [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]] the [[Privy Council]]'s decision forbidding Mass in her household, an important and dangerous task. September 1551 found him laid up at Ingatestone Hall, and unable to travel to Court. He still had many affairs on hand, amongst them a very trivial complaint from the Countess of Southampton, which Sir William forwarded to William Cecil, recommending that her suit be allowed and attended to 'Jane, Countess of Southampton, complains that Hierom Colas, French teacher to her children, has left her service, and begs he may be compelled to return'. In October, he was appointed to confer with the German ambassadors on the proposed Protestant alliance; and in December, he was on a commission for calling in the king's debts.\n\n===Secretary of State to Mary I===\nAs the young [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s health failed, it was necessary to determine what should be done on his death, and a memorial was drawn up and signed by Sir William Petre in May 1553, under the direction of the King and the Privy Council, limiting the succession, in the interest of [[Lady Jane Grey]], to Protestants. Two months later Edward VI was dead and Mary had a powerful party behind her, On 20 July, he, like the majority of the council, declared for Mary, the memorial in Sir William's handwriting was laid on the shelf. He remained in London during the next few days transacting secretarial business, but his wife joined Mary and entered London with her.\n\nPetre had been identified with the council's most obnoxious proceedings towards Mary, and his position was at first insecure. He resumed attendance at the council on 12 August, but in September, it was rumoured that he was out of office. He was however, installed [[Chancellor of the Order of the Garter]] on 26 September when he was directed by the Queen to expunge the new rules formulated during the late reign. He further ingratiated himself with Mary by his zeal in tracing the accomplices of Wyatt's rebellion and by his advocacy of the Spanish marriage. Petre now devoted himself exclusively to his official duties; he rarely missed attendance at the council and was frequently employed to consult with foreign ambassadors. He acquiesced in the restoration of the old religion, and took a prominent part in the reception of [[Reginald Pole|Pole]] and ceremonies connected with the absolution of England from the guilt of heresy.\n\nReligion sat ever easy with William; as he had acquiesced in the Reformation under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], so now he acquiesced in the re-establishment of the Pope's authority and the restoration of the Roman form of service, and was one of the foremost at Cardinal Pole's reception when he came on a mission from the Pope. With his vast Church property, it behoved Sir William to stand well with the new religious authorities; Cardinal Pole had come with instructions not to be too particular about the restoration of abbey lands. Mary approved the scheme drawn up by him. With great dexterity, William succeeded in obtaining a '[[Papal bull|Bull]] of Confirmation' confirming him in possession of the lands he had derived from the suppression of the monasteries. [[Pope Paul IV]] granted this on 27 November 1555. This is believed to be a unique document. Sir William was also absolved from the Interdict of Excommunication placed upon Henry VIII. He was allowed to retain his lands, but was exhorted to endow a charity foundation and to provide pensions for the needy inhabitants of Ingatestone, who had been deprived of their accustomed doles from the monasteries by the wholesale dissolution and destruction that had taken place, so largely by the aid of William Petre himself. This bull is a lengthy document, and enumerates all the Church lands Sir William Petre had acquired, and the prices he had paid for them.\n\nSir William was a judge in the trials of Bishops [[Edmund Bonner|Bonner]] and [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]], and served with Lord Rich of Leigh's Priory as the Council's agent in warning Princess Mary not to have the Mass celebrated at New Hall, [[Boreham]] and Copped Hall, near [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]], her Essex mansions. It was at Ingatestone Hall, where Queen Mary stopped in her journey to London after her accession, that Petre was sworn her Secretary; and here also that [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] offered his obedience, kissed her hand, but lost his appointment as Secretary, which he had shared with his older colleague. Petre was one of the councillors deputed to question [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]] in the Tower on [[Wyatt's rebellion]] (during which Petre raised a small force for the Queen). He also helped to negotiate Mary's marriage.\n\nThe move was a wise one for a man so heavily weighted with Church property, and his adroitness quickly enabled him to be as indispensable to Mary as he had been to her father and brother. He warmly advocated the Spanish marriage with Philip, and was soon freely consulted by Bishop Gardiner on matters of State policy. He took an active part in discovering the persons implicated in Sir [[Thomas Wyatt the younger|Thomas Wyatt]]'s rising which took place early in 1554 with the object of preventing Mary's marriage and of putting Elizabeth on the throne. After the capture of Wyatt, Sir John Bourne writes from the Tower to tell Secretary Petre that he has been labouring to make Sir Thomas Wyatt confess that the Lady Elizabeth and her servant Sir William St. Loo, were implicated in the matter; but Sir Thomas Wyatt confessed nothing, and Elizabeth, though imprisoned for a time, was spared. In July 1554, Philip landed in England and married Mary. The following year Petre attended at Court and wrote thence to the Earl of Devonshire, in July, that the Queen's hour was daily expected.\n\nBy 1556, his income was \u00a33,353 with very modest personal expenses; he wrote to [[Nicholas Wotton]], [[Dean of Canterbury]], desiring Wootton to succeed him as Secretary of State, being himself so out of health.\n\nIt was on his advice that Mary in 1557 forbade the landing of the Pope's messenger sent to confer [[papal legate|legatine]] power on [[William Peto]] instead of Pole; he was responsible for receiving the first Russian ambassador to England. However, by the end of the year, owing to declining health, he ceased to be Secretary.\n\nTogether with Sir [[William Garrard]] and [[Simon Lowe alias Fyfield|Simon Lowe]], he was an executor of the will of [[Maurice Griffith]], [[Bishop of Rochester]], the three having also been mourners at his funeral.<ref>Thomas F.

Ogwen Williams in ''The Dominican'' Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.30</ref>\n\n===Reign of Elizabeth I===\nIn the first decade after the '[[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Settlement]]', 1559, there was a broad toleration of Catholics and they maintained their positions but in ever decreasing numbers.\n\nQueen Mary's reign was even shorter than that of her brother, and on her death the hated Spaniards and Romanists were driven out of the country, and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], the Protestant princess, ascended the throne.\n\nOnce again, to save his place, Sir William had to change his religion, as did so many others; but he was getting an old man \u2013 he had all the property he could desire, his health was failing, and politics no longer attracted him as they had done in his younger days. On Elizabeth's accession, Petre was one of those charged to transact all business before the queen's coronation, and was still employed on various state affairs, but his attendances at the council became less frequent. In March 1559, he writes to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] that he will attend him at the Court if necessary, but wishes to be excused because of the disease of his leg he did however still deputise for Secretary Cecil during the summer of 1560, when Cecil was in Scotland. However, he still had many years of official life before him. He resided much at [[Ingatestone Hall]] in those later days, and we find him writing from there in 1561 about the Portuguese restrictions on English merchants in the Indies.\n\nOne of William's last public duties was to take charge of [[Lady Catherine Grey]] at Ingatestone Hall in 1564\u20131566. Katherine, a younger sister of the ill-fated [[Lady Jane Grey|Lady Jane]], had married the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Earl of Hertford]] without [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s consent. Elizabeth was furious. The care of her seems to have been the last public charge undertaken by William Petre: from 1566 he practically retired and devoted himself to his charitable foundations. He writes again to Cecil that he is too ill to go abroad, though recovered of his fever, and wishes to retire \"to my poore house at Ingatestone\", where he thinks the open air will do him good.\n\n===Retirement===\nThomas Larke in a Survey of the estate in 1566 describes the circumstances of acquiring Ingatestone:\n\n{{quote|''When Sir William Petre first bought the manor, he repaired thither and found, in the middest part of the demesne lands, the situation of an old house scant meet for a farmer to dwell upon, having about it divers houses of office as well builded as the inner houses were, which, when he had well perused and found the commodity of the ground to be such as he could well like of, then forthwith he caused all those old houses to be pulled down and, in stead of them, hath at his own great costs and charges erected and builded other new houses, very fair, large and stately, made of brick and embattled, and hath besides enclosed all the demesne lands lying round about his house with a fair large pale, parklike.''}}\n\nUnlike both the Treshams of Rushton and the Fitzwilliams of Milton, the Petres had no difficulty in adjusting the scale of their entertainment and hospitality to the family's reduced income after Sir William's retirement from Court. Indeed, that the Court could be a means of financial loss is shown by the experiences of Sir William Fitzwilliam III when he held the office of Treasurer of War in Ireland. The Petres were safely removed from both the temptations and the gains of the Court, and in every respect, the nature of their estates placed them ideally for profitable survival throughout the period under review. The personality of the family was well suited to taking full advantage of the opportunities open to them.\n\nIn his later years, he was said to be [[Roman Catholic]], but too prudent to be involved in the many plots that were so constantly being laid against Elizabeth, a creed to which his descendants have consistently adhered. Nevertheless, his piety was not uncompromising, and did not stand in the way of his temporal advancement. Though he was less rapacious than his colleagues in profiting by the fall of Somerset, Petre acquired enormous property by the dissolution of the monasteries; in Devonshire alone he is said to have secured {{convert|36000|acre|km2}}, but his principal seat was at [[Ingatestone]], Essex, which he received on the dissolution of the [[Barking Abbey|Abbey of St. Mary's Barking]]. [[Ingatestone Hall|The hall]], which he built there, still stands almost unimpaired, whilst he is buried with his second wife in a chapel adjoining the chancel of [[St Edmund and St Mary's Church, Ingatestone]].\n\n==Bequests==\nA considerable portion of Petre's wealth was spent on charitable objects; he founded almshouses at Ingatestone, and endowed scholarships for All Souls' College, Oxford. He was one of the first Governors of King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford. Ascham benefited favour by his favour, which he is said to have requited by dedicating to Petre his 'Osorius de Nobilitate Christiana'. In other ways, Petre was a patron of learning; his correspondence with English envoys abroad contains frequent requests for rare books.\n\nHis chief benefactions were to [[Exeter College, Oxford]] (whose rowing eights bear his name to this day), and entitle him to be considered its founder; he rewrote its statutes so its membership was increased. That he retained a warm affection for the College that had given him his early education is evident from the liberal gifts he made. In 1566 he founded seven Scholarships or Fellowships, called the Petrean Fellowships, and the next year founded another to be nominated by him or his heirs from the counties of Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Oxford, Essex, and other counties within the kingdom of England where he had lands and inheritance. For the maintenance of these, he gave four Oxfordshire rectories (which had cost him \u00a31,376) and four parishes (Kidlington, Merton, South Newington and Yarnton) a yearly value of \u00a391 annually. In his will gave a further sum of \u00a340 for the same purpose, to which Lady Petre his widow, and his son and heir [[John Petre, 1st Baron Petre|John]] each added another \u00a340. He was a great collector of books, and presented many to Exeter College library. He also obtained for the College new and beneficial Statutes from the Bishop of Exeter, and a Charter from the Queen that the College might be a body politic and corporate. On his portrait, which hangs in Exeter College Hall, is this inscription ''Octo socios cum terries addidit AD 1566 et multos Libros Bibliothecae contulit''. Probably his liberality to Exeter suggested to his daughter Dorothy and her husband, [[Nicholas Wadham]], the founding of the new college of [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]] at Oxford.\n\n==Marriages and issue==\nPetre married twice:\n\n===First marriage===\nFirstly, in about 1533, he married [[Gertrude Tyrrell]] (died 28 May 1541), with whom he had two daughters:\n*[[Dorothy Wadham|Dorothy Petre]] (1534\u20131618)<ref>[http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenB-Bl.htm Dorothy Barlee (died c.1559), A Who\u2019s Who of Tudor Women: B-Bl, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct ''Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England'' (1984)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622174906/http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenB-Bl.htm |date=22 June 2013 }} Retrieved 10 July 2013.</ref> married [[Nicholas Wadham]] (died 1609), founders of [[Wadham College, Oxford]]{{sfn|Knighton|2004}}\n*Elizabeth Petre, god-daughter of Jane Wriothesley wife of [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton]],{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} who married John Gostwick of [[Willington, Bedfordshire]].{{sfn|Knighton|2004}}\n\n===Second marriage===\nPetre married secondly, by March 1542,{{sfn|Knighton|2004}} [[Anne Browne]] (c.1509<ref>Her portrait states that she was \"aged 58\" in 1567.</ref> \u2013 10 March 1582),{{sfn|Knighton|2004}} widow of John Tyrrell (died 1540),{{sfn|King II|1865|pp=177-80}}<ref>[http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenBrooke-Bu.htm Anne Browne (1509-10 March 1582), A Who\u2019s Who of Tudor Women: Brooke-Bu, compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct ''Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England'' (1984)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020115118/http://www.kateemersonhistoricals.com/TudorWomenBrooke-Bu.htm |date=20 October 2013 }} Retrieved 9 July 2013.</ref> with whom he had three sons and two daughters:\n*[[John Petre, 1st Baron Petre]] (1549\u20131613), who 1570 married Mary Waldegrave (died 2 August 1604).\n*Two sons who died young.\n*Katherine Petre, who married [[John Talbot of Grafton|John Talbot]] of [[Grafton, Worcestershire]].{{sfn|Knighton|2004}}\n*Thomasine Petre, who married Lodovick Greville, son of [[Sir Edward Greville (died 1559)|Sir Edward Greville]] of [[Milcote]];

He rose rapidly in the royal service and was knighted in 1543.\n\nSir William Petre was adept at side-stepping the great religious controversies of the day; in January 1544 he was appointed Secretary of State.  He navigated the ship of state through the rest of Henry's troubled reign, managing a smooth succession in 1547.  He held high office throughout the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] until, owing to ill health he retired a rich man to his manor of [[Ingatestone]], in [[Essex]], where he had built [[Ingatestone Hall]]. His son was [[John Petre, 1st Baron Petre]] of Writtle, raised to the [[peerage]] in 1603. The later Barons Petre have mostly been [[Roman Catholic]]s.\n\nThe musician [[William Byrd]] wrote a [[Pavane|Pavan]] and a [[Galliard]] for Sir William Petre, which were published as part of his ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nBorn in about 1505 or 1506, Petre was the eldest son of John Petre of Tor Newton in the parish of [[Torbryan]], Devon, by his wife Alice Colling, daughter of John Colling of Woodland, Devon.<ref>[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col.

He is claimed as a member of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], of which he was later a benefactor, but there is no evidence of him there as an undergraduate. In 1523 he became a [[Fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], of which he was law bursar in 1528/9. On 2 July 1526 he graduated Bachelor of both laws, and in 1527 and 1528 practised as a lawyer in Oxford.{{sfn|Knighton|2004}}\n\n==Political life==\nPetre's career is strikingly similar to those of other statesmen of his time, such as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], [[John Mason (diplomat)|John Mason]], and [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich]], who, 'sprung from the willow rather than the oak', and served with equal fidelity Kings Henry, Edward and Queens Mary, and Elizabeth, surviving all contemporary political and religious storms. Among mid-Tudor privy councillors, Petre is unique in his unbroken service; he alone escaped execution, imprisonment in the Tower, house arrest, disgrace, fine, exile, or enforced retirement. As a diplomat, his manner was 'smooth, reserved, resolved, yet obliging'. At Boulogne in 1550, Chatillion said of Petre \"Ah, we had gained the last two hundred thousand crowns without hostages, had it not been for that man who said nothing\".\n\nIn his later years, he was said to be a Catholic, a creed to which his descendants have consistently adhered. Nevertheless, his piety was not uncompromising, and did not stand in the way of his temporal advancement. Though he was less rapacious than his colleagues in profiting by the fall of Somerset, Petre acquired enormous property by the dissolution of the monasteries; in Devonshire alone he is said to have secured {{convert|36000|acre|km2}}; but his principal seat was at [[Ingatestone]] which he received on the dissolution of the abbey of St. Mary's Barking.\n\nThough so occupied in politics, he seems to have been a man with wider interests, a considerable portion of his wealth was spent on charitable objects; he founded [[almshouses]] at [[Ingatestone]], and designed scholarships for [[All Souls College, Oxford]], but his chief benefactions were to [[Exeter College, Oxford]], and entitle him to be considered its second founder. In other ways, Petre was a patron of learning; his correspondence with English envoys abroad contains frequent requests for rare books. He was himself governor of [[King Edward VI Grammar School (Chelmsford)|Chelmsford grammar school]], and Ascham benefited by his favour, which he is said to have requited by dedicating to Petre his ''Osorius de Nobilitate Christiana''. A mass of Petre's correspondence has been summarised in the 'Calendars of State Papers', and many of the originals are in the Cottonian, Harleian, and Additional Manuscripts in the British Museum; his transcript of the notes for Edward VI's will is in the Inner Temple Library.\n\nWilliam was educated at the great [[West Country]] college of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter]], at [[Oxford]], arriving there in 1520 when he was about 14 (the usual age at that time), from whence he was elected Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] in 1523 where he graduated Bachelor of Civil and Canon Law on 2 July 1526 (both colleges were generously endowed by him later). Proficient both in [[Roman law|Roman (administrative)]] and [[ecclesiastical law]], in about 1527, he became Principal of [[Peckwater's Inn]] or [[Vine Hall, Oxford|Vine Hall]], and tutor to [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]] (son of the [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Earl of Wiltshire]] and afterwards Viscount Rochford). It was no doubt through the influence of Boleyn's sister [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]] that Petre came to the notice of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] (she sent him presents, and promised him any pleasure it was in her power to give) and was introduced at court and selected for government service. He was sent abroad and resided on the continent, chiefly in France, for more than four years. On his return, he was appointed a [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Clerk in Chancery]] and All Souls made him Doctor of Civil Law on 17 February 1532.\n\nIn 1534, William and Edmund Walsingham examined Anne Husee on the charge of addressing Henry's daughter Mary as Princess when Anne had stayed with her at Hunsdon, and whether she thought her the lawful daughter of the king. Anne Husee, knowing her head to be in danger if she continued to support Mary, took the more prudent way and besought pardon. 'She most humbly beseecheth his Highness of mercy and forgiveness, as One that is repentant for that she hath so offended and purposeth never hereafter to fall in to semblable danger, \u2013 signed Anne Husee, countersigned Edmund Walsyngham. Per me Gulielmum Petre'.\n\nFrom his youth he must have been a capable, pushing, insinuating man. He was only about thirty when he was already in high favour with [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] and Cromwell, who spoke in November 1535 of making Petre dean of arches, there 'being no man more fit for it'.\n\nOn 13 January 1536, he was appointed deputy or proctor for Cromwell in his capacity as [[vicar general|Vicar-General]] and appointed [[Visitor]] of the greater monasteries in Kent and other southern counties, being especially active in the West Country. In the same year, he was made [[Court of Chancery|Master in Chancery]], was placed on a commission to receive and examine all bulls and briefs from Rome, and granted the [[prebendary|prebend]] of Langford Ecclesia in [[Lincoln Cathedral]], which he resigned the following year. On 16 June 1536, Petre appeared in Convocation and made a novel claim to preside over its deliberations, on the ground that the King was supreme head of the church, Cromwell was the King's vicegerent, and he was Cromwell's deputy. After some discussion, his claim was allowed. In 1537 was employed to examine [[Robert Aske (political leader)|Robert Aske]] and other prisoners taken in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|Lincolnshire and Yorkshire rebellions]].\n\nSoon he was actively visiting and aiding in the suppression of the smaller monasteries, he was one of the most zealous of the visitors. Among the twenty monasteries he visited and procured the surrender of in 1538 were, perhaps, St. Leonard's, Thoby and [[Blackmore]]. In the first three months of 1539, thirteen more fell before him; he being instrumental in the almost total extirpation of the [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertines]], the only religious order of English origin. A few years later, he was Visitor of the greater monasteries in Kent and the South of England.\n\n===Secretary of State to Henry VIII===\nHis fortunes were linked with those of [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[vicar general|Vicar General]]. In 1539, Petre was one of those appointed to prepare a bill for the enactment of 'The [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]]', and in the following year was on the commission that declared the nullity of Henry's marriage with [[Anne of Cleves]]. Early in 1543, he was knighted, appointed [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] in [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Wriothesley]]'s place and placed on various commissions to inquire into causes of supposed heresy. In 1544, Henry made William a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Councillor]], and on 9 July 1544, one of his two Principal Secretaries selected to assist [[Catherine Howard|Queen Catherine]] in carrying on the Regency in the small 'Regency Council' during Henry's absence, and to raise supplies for the King's expedition to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. In 1545, he was sent abroad as ambassador to the great [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], but at the end of the year was summoned back to the Privy Council.\n\nThough much occupied with public business, this astute politician found time and many opportunities to get and lay by great gain for himself. As one of the Visitors of the monasteries, he knew better than many people what properties were worth acquiring. He paid the King some \u00a3849 12s 6d (approximately \u00a3330,000 today) for the property known as \"Ginge Abbes\" at [[Ingatestone]], even though the King was trying to raise money and this was a \"fair\" price it is probably true Sir William got a bargain. Ingatestone, which had previously belonged to [[Barking Abbey]], must have been selected as being a particularly fertile and well-cultivated district at that period, within an easy ride of London, and with the comfortable house of the Abbess's steward, with its fish-ponds and park, easily turned into an excellent country residence for the busy statesman. Here, at [[Ingatestone Hall]], Sir William Petre established himself and his family, and many of his letters are dated from this place.\n\nHowever, there is some evidence of an institutionalised system of bribery and corruption. Those in public office were expected to charge for favours and salaries were accordingly set very low. Accounts show that by 1540, William was receiving \u00a3180 per year in annuities from religious houses he had visited (approximately \u00a370,000 today). It is strange that abbeys should give annuities to an individual charged with abolishing them; they were probably bribes either to delay the procedure or to facilitate a fat pension for the retiring Abbot. William received money from about twenty monasteries.\n\n===Secretary of State to Edward VI===\nWhen [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] died in 1547 William was appointed an assistant executor to his will. This gave him much hold over the Protestant and youthful sovereign, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], and his power, importance and activity rapidly increased. In August 1547, he was entrusted with the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] for use in all ecclesiastical affairs.\n\nIn 1547 he was first elected as [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]]. He was returned for Essex a further eight times in 1553 (twice), 1554 (twice), 1555, 1558, 1559 and 1563. He may have previously sat for [[Downton (UK Parliament constituency)|Downton]] in 1536.<ref name=history>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/petre-william-15056-72 Petre, William (1505/6-72), of Ingatestone, Essex and Aldersgate Street, London, History of Parliament] Retrieved 9 July 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1549, he served on commissions to visit the [[University of Oxford]] inquiring into heresies, to examine the charges against [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Lord Seymour of Sudeley]], and to try [[Edmund Bonner|Bonner]]. He did not take part in Bonner's trial after the first day, and it was rumoured that he 'was turning about to another party'. On 6 October 1549, he was sent by [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] to the council to demand the reason of their coming together, though at first a supporter of the Protector Somerset. Finding them the stronger party he deserted Somerset just before his fall, remaining to sign the council's letter to the lord mayor denouncing the protector; four days later he also signed the proclamation against Somerset.\n\nBy the 1550s, he was very prosperous. Not only was he Secretary of State but he also had many other sinecures such as warden of [[Bishop of Winchester]]'s lands. He enjoyed many rewards such as free board and lodging at court. In February 1550, he was sent to Boulogne to negotiate the terms of peace with France, and in the following May exchanged ratifications of it at [[Amiens]]. William Petre is described as smooth and obliging in manner, yet reserved and resolved, and not given to many words. In the same year, he was treasurer of [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths|First Fruits and Tenths]] and one of the commissioners to examine [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]]; he was also sent to [[Palace of Beaulieu|New Hall, Essex]], to request Mary to come to court or change her residence to Oking. William also writes in terms of friendship to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] in 1551, from Ingatestone, regretting to hear that Cecil is ill, thanking him for a book he had sent, and saying his little ones when they are able shall send him some proof of their progress; and writes again later to congratulate Cecil on his recovery.\n\nIn August 1551, Petre was one of those who communicated to [[Mary I of England|Princess Mary]] the [[Privy Council]]'s decision forbidding Mass in her household, an important and dangerous task. September 1551 found him laid up at Ingatestone Hall, and unable to travel to Court. He still had many affairs on hand, amongst them a very trivial complaint from the Countess of Southampton, which Sir William forwarded to William Cecil, recommending that her suit be allowed and attended to 'Jane, Countess of Southampton, complains that Hierom Colas, French teacher to her children, has left her service, and begs he may be compelled to return'. In October, he was appointed to confer with the German ambassadors on the proposed Protestant alliance; and in December, he was on a commission for calling in the king's debts.\n\n===Secretary of State to Mary I===\nAs the young [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s health failed, it was necessary to determine what should be done on his death, and a memorial was drawn up and signed by Sir William Petre in May 1553, under the direction of the King and the Privy Council, limiting the succession, in the interest of [[Lady Jane Grey]], to Protestants. Two months later Edward VI was dead and Mary had a powerful party behind her, On 20 July, he, like the majority of the council, declared for Mary, the memorial in Sir William's handwriting was laid on the shelf. He remained in London during the next few days transacting secretarial business, but his wife joined Mary and entered London with her.\n\nPetre had been identified with the council's most obnoxious proceedings towards Mary, and his position was at first insecure. He resumed attendance at the council on 12 August, but in September, it was rumoured that he was out of office. He was however, installed [[Chancellor of the Order of the Garter]] on 26 September when he was directed by the Queen to expunge the new rules formulated during the late reign. He further ingratiated himself with Mary by his zeal in tracing the accomplices of Wyatt's rebellion and by his advocacy of the Spanish marriage. Petre now devoted himself exclusively to his official duties; he rarely missed attendance at the council and was frequently employed to consult with foreign ambassadors. He acquiesced in the restoration of the old religion, and took a prominent part in the reception of [[Reginald Pole|Pole]] and ceremonies connected with the absolution of England from the guilt of heresy.\n\nReligion sat ever easy with William; as he had acquiesced in the Reformation under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], so now he acquiesced in the re-establishment of the Pope's authority and the restoration of the Roman form of service, and was one of the foremost at Cardinal Pole's reception when he came on a mission from the Pope. With his vast Church property, it behoved Sir William to stand well with the new religious authorities; Cardinal Pole had come with instructions not to be too particular about the restoration of abbey lands. Mary approved the scheme drawn up by him. With great dexterity, William succeeded in obtaining a '[[Papal bull|Bull]] of Confirmation' confirming him in possession of the lands he had derived from the suppression of the monasteries. [[Pope Paul IV]] granted this on 27 November 1555. This is believed to be a unique document. Sir William was also absolved from the Interdict of Excommunication placed upon Henry VIII. He was allowed to retain his lands, but was exhorted to endow a charity foundation and to provide pensions for the needy inhabitants of Ingatestone, who had been deprived of their accustomed doles from the monasteries by the wholesale dissolution and destruction that had taken place, so largely by the aid of William Petre himself. This bull is a lengthy document, and enumerates all the Church lands Sir William Petre had acquired, and the prices he had paid for them.\n\nSir William was a judge in the trials of Bishops [[Edmund Bonner|Bonner]] and [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]], and served with Lord Rich of Leigh's Priory as the Council's agent in warning Princess Mary not to have the Mass celebrated at New Hall, [[Boreham]] and Copped Hall, near [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey]], her Essex mansions. It was at Ingatestone Hall, where Queen Mary stopped in her journey to London after her accession, that Petre was sworn her Secretary; and here also that [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] offered his obedience, kissed her hand, but lost his appointment as Secretary, which he had shared with his older colleague. Petre was one of the councillors deputed to question [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]] in the Tower on [[Wyatt's rebellion]] (during which Petre raised a small force for the Queen). He also helped to negotiate Mary's marriage.\n\nThe move was a wise one for a man so heavily weighted with Church property, and his adroitness quickly enabled him to be as indispensable to Mary as he had been to her father and brother. He warmly advocated the Spanish marriage with Philip, and was soon freely consulted by Bishop Gardiner on matters of State policy. He took an active part in discovering the persons implicated in Sir [[Thomas Wyatt the younger|Thomas Wyatt]]'s rising which took place early in 1554 with the object of preventing Mary's marriage and of putting Elizabeth on the throne. After the capture of Wyatt, Sir John Bourne writes from the Tower to tell Secretary Petre that he has been labouring to make Sir Thomas Wyatt confess that the Lady Elizabeth and her servant Sir William St. Loo, were implicated in the matter; but Sir Thomas Wyatt confessed nothing, and Elizabeth, though imprisoned for a time, was spared. In July 1554, Philip landed in England and married Mary. The following year Petre attended at Court and wrote thence to the Earl of Devonshire, in July, that the Queen's hour was daily expected.\n\nBy 1556, his income was \u00a33,353 with very modest personal expenses; he wrote to [[Nicholas Wotton]], [[Dean of Canterbury]], desiring Wootton to succeed him as Secretary of State, being himself so out of health.\n\nIt was on his advice that Mary in 1557 forbade the landing of the Pope's messenger sent to confer [[papal legate|legatine]] power on [[William Peto]] instead of Pole; he was responsible for receiving the first Russian ambassador to England. However, by the end of the year, owing to declining health, he ceased to be Secretary.\n\nTogether with Sir [[William Garrard]] and [[Simon Lowe alias Fyfield|Simon Lowe]], he was an executor of the will of [[Maurice Griffith]], [[Bishop of Rochester]], the three having also been mourners at his funeral.<ref>Thomas F. Mayer and Courtney B. Walters (2008) ''The Correspondence of Reginald Pole, IV: a Biographical Companion. The British Isles'', p.231</ref><ref>''The Diary of Henry Machyn'', Nicholas J.G. ed., Camden Society Original series 42: London, 1848, p. 180.</ref> In consequence of this, these three played a part as the initial trustees in the founding of [[Friars School, Bangor]].<ref>W. Ogwen Williams in ''The Dominican'' Jones & Haworth (eds.)(1957), p.30</ref>\n\n===Secretary of State to Elizabeth I===\nIn the first decade after the '[[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Settlement]]', 1559, there was a broad toleration of Catholics and they maintained their positions but in ever decreasing numbers.\n\nQueen Mary's reign was even shorter than that of her brother, and on her death the hated Spaniards and Romanists were driven out of the country, and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], the Protestant princess, ascended the throne.\n\nOnce again, to save his place, Sir William had to change his religion, as did so many others; but he was getting an old man \u2013 he had all the property he could desire, his health was failing, and politics no longer attracted him as they had done in his younger days. On Elizabeth's accession, Petre was one of those charged to transact all business before the queen's coronation, and was still employed on various state affairs, but his attendances at the council became less frequent. In March 1559, he writes to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] that he will attend him at the Court if necessary, but wishes to be excused because of the disease of his leg he did however still deputise for Secretary Cecil during the summer of 1560, when Cecil was in Scotland. However, he still had many years of official life before him. He resided much at [[Ingatestone Hall]] in those later days, and we find him writing from there in 1561 about the Portuguese restrictions on English merchants in the Indies.\n\nOne of William's last public duties was to take charge of [[Lady Catherine Grey]] at Ingatestone Hall in 1564\u20131566. Katherine, a younger sister of the ill-fated [[Lady Jane Grey|Lady Jane]], had married the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Earl of Hertford]] without [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s consent. Elizabeth was furious. The care of her seems to have been the last public charge undertaken by William Petre: from 1566 he practically retired and devoted himself to his charitable foundations. He writes again to Cecil that he is too ill to go abroad, though recovered of his fever, and wishes to retire \"to my poore house at Ingatestone\", where he thinks the open air will do him good.\n\n===Retirement===\nThomas Larke in a Survey of the estate in 1566 describes the circumstances of acquiring Ingatestone:\n\n{{quote|''When Sir William Petre first bought the manor, he repaired thither and found, in the middest part of the demesne lands, the situation of an old house scant meet for a farmer to dwell upon, having about it divers houses of office as well builded as the inner houses were, which, when he had well perused and found the commodity of the ground to be such as he could well like of, then forthwith he caused all those old houses to be pulled down and, in stead of them, hath at his own great costs and charges erected and builded other new houses, very fair, large and stately, made of brick and embattled, and hath besides enclosed all the demesne lands lying round about his house with a fair large pale, parklike.''}}\n\nUnlike both the Treshams of Rushton and the Fitzwilliams of Milton, the Petres had no difficulty in adjusting the scale of their entertainment and hospitality to the family's reduced income after Sir William's retirement from Court. Indeed, that the Court could be a means of financial loss is shown by the experiences of Sir William Fitzwilliam III when he held the office of Treasurer of War in Ireland. The Petres were safely removed from both the temptations and the gains of the Court, and in every respect, the nature of their estates placed them ideally for profitable survival throughout the period under review. The personality of the family was well suited to taking full advantage of the opportunities open to them.\n\nIn his later years, he was said to be [[Roman Catholic]], but too prudent to be involved in the many plots that were so constantly being laid against Elizabeth, a creed to which his descendants have consistently adhered. Nevertheless, his piety was not uncompromising, and did not stand in the way of his temporal advancement. Though he was less rapacious than his colleagues in profiting by the fall of Somerset, Petre acquired enormous property by the dissolution of the monasteries; in Devonshire alone he is said to have secured {{convert|36000|acre|km2}}, but his principal seat was at [[Ingatestone]], Essex, which he received on the dissolution of the [[Barking Abbey|Abbey of St. Mary's Barking]]. [[Ingatestone Hall|The hall]], which he built there, still stands almost unimpaired, whilst he is buried with his second wife in a chapel adjoining the chancel of [[St Edmund and St Mary's Church, Ingatestone]].\n\n==Bequests==\nA considerable portion of Petre's wealth was spent on charitable objects; he founded almshouses at Ingatestone, and endowed scholarships for All Souls' College, Oxford. He was one of the first Governors of King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford. Ascham benefited favour by his favour, which he is said to have requited by dedicating to Petre his 'Osorius de Nobilitate Christiana'. In other ways, Petre was a patron of learning; his correspondence with English envoys abroad contains frequent requests for rare books.\n\nHis chief benefactions were to [[Exeter College, Oxford]] (whose rowing eights bear his name to this day), and entitle him to be considered its founder; he rewrote its statutes so its membership was increased. That he retained a warm affection for the College that had given him his early education is evident from the liberal gifts he made. In 1566 he founded seven Scholarships or Fellowships, called the Petrean Fellowships, and the next year founded another to be nominated by him or his heirs from the counties of Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Oxford, Essex, and other counties within the kingdom of England where he had lands and inheritance. For the maintenance of these, he gave four Oxfordshire rectories (which had cost him \u00a31,376) and four parishes (Kidlington, Merton, South Newington and Yarnton) a yearly value of \u00a391 annually. In his will gave a further sum of \u00a340 for the same purpose, to which Lady Petre his widow, and his son and heir [[John Petre, 1st Baron Petre|John]] each added another \u00a340. He was a great collector of books, and presented many to Exeter College library. He also obtained for the College new and beneficial Statutes from the Bishop of Exeter, and a Charter from the Queen that the College might be a body politic and corporate. On his portrait, which hangs in Exeter College Hall, is this inscription ''Octo socios cum terries addidit AD 1566 et multos Libros Bibliothecae contulit''.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.

like it is.\"<ref>https://www.thequint.com/neon/social-buzz/subramanian-swamy-trolled-on-twitter</ref>\n\nFollowing criticism of Pakistan by Trump, Swamy called for closer relations between India and

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.

{"title_page": "Volcanic gas", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2007}}\n[[File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006.jpg|thumb|Volcanic gases entering the atmosphere with dust and tephra during eruption of [[Augustine Volcano]], 2006.]]\n[[File:MSH04 crater eruption image 1213PDT 10-01-04.jpg|thumb|Eruption of [[Mount St. Helens]]]]\n\n'''Volcanic gases''' are gases given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) [[volcano]]es. These include gases trapped in cavities ([[Vesicular texture|vesicles]]) in [[volcanic rock]]s, dissolved or dissociated [[gas]]es in [[magma]] and [[lava]], or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through [[hydrothermal|ground water heated by volcanic action]].\n\nThe sources of volcanic gases on Earth include: \n* primordial and recycled constituents from the [[Mantle (geology)#Earth's mantle|Earth's mantle]], \n* assimilated constituents from the [[Earth's crust]], \n* [[groundwater]] and the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. \nSubstances that may become gaseous or give off gases when heated are termed volatile substances.\n\n==what are u doing here==\n[[File:Volcanic injection.svg|thumb|Schematic of volcanic eruption]]\nThe principal components of volcanic gases are [[water vapor]] (H<sub>2</sub>O), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), [[sulfur]] either as [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) (high-temperature volcanic gases) or [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) (low-temperature volcanic gases), [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[helium]], [[neon]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]]  and [[hydrogen]]. Other [[compound (chemistry)|compounds]] detected in volcanic gases are [[oxygen]] (meteoric), [[hydrogen chloride]], [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[hydrogen bromide]], [[nitrogen oxide]]  (NO<sub>x</sub>), [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[carbonyl sulfide]], and [[organic compounds]]. Exotic trace compounds include [[mercury compounds|mercury]], [[halocarbons]] (including [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s), and [[halogen]] [[oxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]].\n\nThe abundance of gases varies considerably from volcano to volcano, with volcanic activity and with tectonic setting. Water vapour is consistently the most abundant volcanic gas, normally comprising more than 60% of total emissions. Carbon dioxide typically accounts for 10 to 40% of emissions.<ref name=\"Encyclovolc\">H. Sigurdsson et al. (2000) ''Encyclopedia of Volcanoes'', San Diego, Academic Press</ref>\n\nVolcanoes located at [[convergent plate]] boundaries emit more water vapor and [[chlorine]] than volcanoes at [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]]s or [[divergent plate]] boundaries. This is caused by the addition of seawater into magmas formed at [[subduction zone]]s. Convergent plate boundary volcanoes also have higher H<sub>2</sub>O/H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/He and N<sub>2</sub>/He ratios than [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] or divergent plate boundary volcanoes.<ref name=\"Encyclovolc\"/>\n\n== Magmatic gases and high-temperature volcanic gases ==\n\nMagma contains dissolved [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile components]], as described above. The solubilities of the different volatile constituents are dependent on pressure, temperature and the composition of the [[magma]]. As magma ascends towards the surface, the ambient pressure decreases, which decreases the solubility of the dissolved volatiles. Once the solubility decreases below the volatile concentration, the volatiles will tend to come out of solution within the magma (exsolve) and form a separate gas phase (the magma is [[Supersaturation|super-saturated]] in volatiles).\n\nThe gas will initially be distributed throughout the magma as small bubbles, that cannot rise quickly through the magma. As the magma ascends the bubbles grow through a combination of expansion through decompression and growth as the solubility of volatiles in the magma decreases further causing more gas to exsolve. Depending on the viscosity of the magma, the bubbles may start to rise through the magma and coalesce, or they remain relatively fixed in place until they begin to connect and form a continuously connected network. In the former case, the bubbles may rise through the magma and accumulate at a vertical surface, e.g. the 'roof' of a magma chamber. In volcanoes with an open path to the surface, e.g. [[Stromboli]] in [[Italy]], the bubbles may reach the surface and as they pop small explosions occur. In the latter case, the gas can flow rapidly through the continuous permeable network towards the surface. This mechanism has been used to explain activity at Santiaguito, [[Santa Mar\u00eda (volcano)|Santa Maria volcano]], [[Guatemala]]<ref>Holland et al. (2011), ''Degassing processes during lava dome growth: Insights from Santiaguito lava dome, Guatemala'', Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research vol. 202 p153-166</ref> and [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills]] Volcano, [[Montserrat]].<ref>Hautmann et al. (2014), ''Strain field analysis on Montserrat (W.I.) as a tool for assessing permeable flow paths in the magmatic system of Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano'', Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems vol. 15 p676-690</ref> If the gas cannot escape fast enough from the magma, it will fragment the magma into small particles of ash. The fluidised ash has a much lower resistance to motion than the viscous magma, so accelerates, causing further expansion of the gases and acceleration of the mixture. This sequence of events drives explosive volcanism. Whether gas can escape gently (passive eruptions) or not (explosive eruptions) is determined by the total volatile contents of the initial magma and the [[viscosity]] of the magma, which is controlled by its composition.\n\nThe term `closed system' degassing refers to the case where gas and its parent magma ascend together and in [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] with each other. The composition of the emitted gas is in [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the composition of the magma at the pressure, temperature where the gas leaves the system. In `open system' degassing, the gas leaves its parent magma and rises up through the overlying magma without remaining in equilibrium with that magma. The gas released at the surface has a composition that is a mass-flow average of the magma exsolved at various depths and is not representative of the magma conditions at any one depth.\n\nMolten rock (either [[magma]] or [[lava]]) near the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] releases high-temperature volcanic gas (>400&nbsp;\u00b0C). \nIn explosive [[volcanic eruption]]s, the sudden release of gases from magma may cause rapid movements of the molten rock. When the magma encounters water, seawater, lake water or groundwater, it can be rapidly fragmented. The rapid expansion of gases is the driving mechanism of most explosive volcanic eruptions.  However, a significant portion of volcanic gas release occurs during quasi-continuous quiescent phases of active volcanism.\n\n== Low-temperature volcanic gases and hydrothermal systems==\n\nAs magmatic gas travelling upward encounters [[meteoric water]] in an [[aquifer]], steam is produced. Latent magmatic heat can also cause meteoric waters to ascend as a vapour phase. Extended fluid-rock interaction of this hot mixture can leach constituents out of the cooling magmatic rock and also the [[country rock (geology)|country rock]], causing volume changes and phase transitions, reactions and thus an increase in [[ionic strength]] of the upward percolating fluid. This process also decreases the fluid's [[pH]]. Cooling can cause [[phase separation]] and [[mineral]] deposition, accompanied by a shift toward more reducing conditions. At the surface expression of such [[hydrothermal]] systems, low-temperature volcanic gases (<400&nbsp;\u00b0C) are either emanating as steam-gas mixtures or in dissolved form in [[hot springs]]. At the ocean floor, such hot supersaturated hydrothermal fluids form gigantic chimney structures called [[black smoker]]s, at the point of emission into the cold [[seawater]].\n\n== Non-explosive volcanic gas release ==\n\nThe gas release can occur by advection through fractures, or via diffuse degassing through large areas of permeable ground as diffuse degassing structures (DDS). At sites of advective gas loss, precipitation of [[Native sulfur|sulfur]] and [[Volcanic sublimate|rare minerals]] forms sulfur deposits and small sulfur chimneys, called [[fumarole]]s. Very low-temperature (below 100&nbsp;\u00b0C) fumarolic structures are also known as [[solfatara]]s. Sites of cold degassing of predominantly [[carbon dioxide]] are called [[mofette]]s. [[Hot springs]] on volcanoes often show a measurable amount of magmatic gas in dissolved form.\n\n== Sensing, collection and measurement ==\n\nVolcanic gases were collected and analysed as long ago as 1790 by [[Scipione Breislak]] in Italy.<ref>N. Morello (editor) (1998), ''Volcanoes and History'', Genoa, Brigati</ref> The composition of volcanic gases is dependent on the movement of magma within the volcano. Therefore, sudden changes in gas composition often presage a change in volcanic activity. Accordingly, a large part of hazard monitoring of volcanoes involves regular measurement of gaseous emissions. For example, an increase in the CO<sub>2</sub> content of gases at [[Stromboli]] has been ascribed to injection of fresh volatile-rich magma at depth within the system. <ref>Burton et al. (2007) ''Magmatic Gas Composition Reveals the Source Depth of Slug-Driven Strombolian Explosive Activity'' Science vol 317 p.227-230.</ref>\n\nVolcanic gases can be sensed (measured in-situ) or sampled for further analysis. Volcanic gas sensing can be:\n* within the gas by means of electrochemical sensors and flow-through [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared-spectroscopic]] gas cells\n* outside the gas by ground-based or airborne remote [[spectroscopy]] e.g., Correlation spectroscopy (COSPEC), [[Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy]] (DOAS), or [[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]] (FTIR).\n\nSulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet wavelengths and has low background concentrations in the atmosphere. These characteristics make sulphur dioxide a good target for volcanic gas monitoring. It can be detected by satellite-based instruments, which allow for global monitoring, and by ground-based instruments such as DOAS. DOAS arrays are placed near some well-monitored volcanoes and used to estimate the flux of SO<sub>2</sub> emitted. The [[Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System]] (Multi-GAS) is also used to remotely measure CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. The fluxes of other gases are usually estimated by measuring the ratios of different gases within the volcanic plume, e.g. by FTIR, electrochemical sensors at the volcano crater rim, or direct sampling, and multiplying the ratio of the gas of interest to SO<sub>2</sub> by the SO<sub>2</sub> flux.\n\nDirect sampling of volcanic gas sampling is often done by a method involving an evacuated flask with [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] solution, first used by [[Robert Bunsen|Robert W. Bunsen]] (1811-1899) and later refined by the German chemist [[Werner F. Giggenbach]] (1937-1997), dubbed ''Giggenbach-bottle''. Other methods include collection in evacuated empty containers, in flow-through glass tubes, in gas wash bottles (cryogenic scrubbers), on impregnated filter packs and on solid adsorbent tubes.\n\nAnalytical techniques for gas samples comprise gas [[chromatography]] with [[thermal conductivity]] detection (TCD), [[flame ionization detector|flame ionization detection]] (FID) and [[mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) for gases, and various wet chemical techniques for dissolved species (e.g., acidimetric [[titration]] for dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, and [[ion chromatography]] for [[sulfate]], [[chloride]], [[fluoride]]). The trace metal, trace organic and [[isotope|isotopic]] composition is usually determined by different mass spectrometric methods.\n\n== Volcanic gases and volcano monitoring ==\n{{Main|Prediction of volcanic activity}}\n\nCertain constituents of volcanic gases may show very early signs of changing conditions at depth, making them a powerful tool to predict imminent unrest. Used in conjunction with monitoring data on [[volcanic tremor|seismicity]] and [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]], correlative monitoring gains great efficiency. Volcanic gas monitoring is a standard tool of any [[volcano observatory]]. Unfortunately, the most precise compositional data still require dangerous field sampling campaigns. However, [[remote sensing]] techniques have advanced tremendously through the 1990s. The [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]] is employing Multi-GAS remote sensing to monitor 9 volcanoes on a continuous basis.\n\n== Hazards ==\n\nVolcanic gases were directly responsible for approximately 3% of all volcano-related deaths of humans between 1900 and 1986.<ref name=\"Encyclovolc\"/> Some volcanic gases kill by acidic [[corrosion]]; others kill by [[asphyxiation]].

Exotic trace compounds include [[mercury compounds|mercury]], [[halocarbons]] (including [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s), and [[halogen]] [[oxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]].\n\nThe abundance of gases varies considerably from volcano to volcano, with volcanic activity and with tectonic setting. Water vapour is consistently the most abundant volcanic gas, normally comprising more than 60% of total emissions. Carbon dioxide typically accounts for 10 to 40% of emissions.<ref name=\"Encyclovolc\">H. Sigurdsson et al. (2000) ''Encyclopedia of Volcanoes'', San Diego, Academic Press</ref>\n\nVolcanoes located at [[convergent plate]] boundaries emit more water vapor and [[chlorine]] than volcanoes at [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]]s or [[divergent plate]] boundaries. This is caused by the addition of seawater into magmas formed at [[subduction zone]]s. Convergent plate boundary volcanoes also have higher H<sub>2</sub>O/H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/He and N<sub>2</sub>/He ratios than [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] or divergent plate boundary volcanoes.<ref name=\"Encyclovolc\"/>\n\n== Magmatic gases and high-temperature volcanic gases ==\n\nMagma contains dissolved [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile components]], as described above. The solubilities of the different volatile constituents are dependent on pressure, temperature and the composition of the [[magma]]. As magma ascends towards the surface, the ambient pressure decreases, which decreases the solubility of the dissolved volatiles. Once the solubility decreases below the volatile concentration, the volatiles will tend to come out of solution within the magma (exsolve) and form a separate gas phase (the magma is [[Supersaturation|super-saturated]] in volatiles).\n\nThe gas will initially be distributed throughout the magma as small bubbles, that cannot rise quickly through the magma. As the magma ascends the bubbles grow through a combination of expansion through decompression and growth as the solubility of volatiles in the magma decreases further causing more gas to exsolve. Depending on the viscosity of the magma, the bubbles may start to rise through the magma and coalesce, or they remain relatively fixed in place until they begin to connect and form a continuously connected network.
