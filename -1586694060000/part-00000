Named in [[1996 in paleontology|1996]] by Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]], it contains a single [[species]], '''''Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis'''''. The identity of the genus has been debated by scientists, with some considering its fossils to represent material from the closely related species [[Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus|''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'']], while others have classified it as a separate taxon, forming the clade [[Spinosaurini]] with ''Spinosaurus'' as its [[sister taxon]].\n\n''Sigilmassasaurus'' was a moderately-built, ground-dwelling, [[bipedal]] [[carnivore]], like most other theropods. It may have had strong neck musculature as evidenced by the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[Vertebra]]e (backbones). ''Sigilmassasaurus'' may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits and a largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) diet. It coexisted with other large theropods in the [[Kem Kem Formation]].\n\n== History of research ==\n\n[[Fossil]]s of this dinosaur were recovered at the [[Kem Kem Formation]] in the [[Tafilalt]] [[Oasis]] region of [[Morocco]], near the site of the ancient city of [[Sijilmassa]], for which it was named. Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]] named ''Sigilmassasaurus'' in 1996, from the ancient city and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). A single [[species]] was named, ''S. brevicollis'', which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''brevis'' (\"short\") and ''collum'' (\"neck\"), because the neck [[vertebra]]e are very short from front to back.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=D.A.|date=1996|title=Isolated Dinosaur bones from the Middle Cretaceous of the Tafilalt, Morocco|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282407346|journal=Bulletin du Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Section C|volume=18|pages=349\u2013402|via=}}</ref> ''Sigilmassasaurus'' comes from red sandstone sediments in southern Morocco, which are known by various names, including the ''Gr\u00e8s rouges infrac\u00e9nomaniens'', Continental Red Beds, and lower [[Kem Kem Beds]].

Named in [[1996 in paleontology|1996]] by Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]], it contains a single [[species]], '''''Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis'''''. The identity of the genus has been debated by scientists, with some considering its fossils to represent material from the closely related species [[Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus|''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'']], while others have classified it as a separate taxon, forming the clade [[Spinosaurini]] with ''Spinosaurus'' as its [[sister taxon]].\n\n''Sigilmassasaurus'' was a moderately-built, ground-dwelling, [[bipedal]] [[carnivore]], like most other theropods. It may have had strong neck musculature as evidenced by the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] (backbones). ''Sigilmassasaurus'' may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits and a largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) diet. It coexisted with other large theropods in the [[Kem Kem Formation]].\n\n== History of research ==\n\n[[Fossil]]s of this dinosaur were recovered at the [[Kem Kem Formation]] in the [[Tafilalt]] [[Oasis]] region of [[Morocco]], near the site of the ancient city of [[Sijilmassa]], for which it was named. Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]] named ''Sigilmassasaurus'' in 1996, from the ancient city and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). A single [[species]] was named, ''S. brevicollis'', which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''brevis'' (\"short\") and ''collum'' (\"neck\"), because the neck [[vertebra]]e are very short from front to back.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=D.A.|date=1996|title=Isolated Dinosaur bones from the Middle Cretaceous of the Tafilalt, Morocco|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282407346|journal=Bulletin du Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Section C|volume=18|pages=349\u2013402|via=}}</ref> ''Sigilmassasaurus'' comes from red sandstone sediments in southern Morocco, which are known by various names, including the ''Gr\u00e8s rouges infrac\u00e9nomaniens'', Continental Red Beds, and lower [[Kem Kem Beds]].

Years later, an adult Noah lives with his wife [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naameh]] and their sons [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], and [[Japheth]]. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather [[Methuselah]].\n\nThey encounter a group of people recently killed and take in and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. Ila is treated for an abdominal wound and will survive, but Naameh determines that she will be unable to have children. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the [[fallen angel]]s known as the \"Watchers\", in whose territory Methuselah lives. The Watchers are confined on Earth as creatures of stone for helping humans banished from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. After a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an [[Noah's Ark|ark]].\n\nAfter birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are sedated with incense.\n\nWith Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth but, seeing the settlers selling their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the Creator wants all of humanity dead. He tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations.\n\nDevastated that he will be alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but, when he will not, she goes to Methuselah for help. Ila encounters Methuselah who cures her infertility. Ham, searching for a wife on his own, befriends the refugee Na'el.\n\nAfter it starts raining, Tubal-cain becomes angry that he was not chosen to be saved and incites his followers to make a run for the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest and forces Ham to save himself, but leaves Na'el to die when she is caught in an animal trap. Noah's family enter the ark except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers fight off Tubal-cain and his mob of followers, sacrificing themselves and ascending to heaven, their reward for protecting Noah. As the flood drowns the remaining humans, an injured Tubal-cain climbs onto the ark and solicits Ham, playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Na'el to die.\n\nIla discovers she is pregnant as the rains stop and begs the Creator to let the child live. Noah interprets the ending of the rain to mean he must ensure the extinction of humans and, against his wife's protests, resolves that, if the child is a girl, he will kill her. Nine months later, Ila and Shem build a raft to escape Noah's resolve, but Noah discovers and burns it. Ila then starts feeling labor pains and gives birth to twin girls. After Ham calls Noah telling him the beasts are awake and eating each other, Tubal-cain emerges and attempts to hit Noah. Noah and Tubal-cain engage in combat. Shem promises Ila that Noah will not harm their daughters and goes to stop him. He attacks Noah as Tubal-cain falls to the ground only to be knocked out. Tubal-cain eventually forces Noah to the edge of the raft, but Ham kills him with a dagger before he can shove Noah in the ocean. Noah picks himself up and finds Ila and the babies, intending to kill the children, but spares them upon looking at his granddaughters and only feeling love.\n\nUpon exiting the ark on the new land, a shameful Noah goes into isolation in a nearby cave, making wine in which to drown his sorrows. Ham expresses disappointment for his father's current state of unseemly drunkenness and nakedness before leaving his kin to live alone. Having reconciled at the behest of Ila, Noah blesses the family as the beginning of a new human race and all witness waves of immense celestial rainbows.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Noah]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title=It's Official: Russell Crowe to Star in Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/russell-crowe-noah-darren-aronofsky-314892|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>\n** [[Dakota Goyo]] as a young Noah<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Kevin Durand, Marton Csokas & Dakota Goyo Book Passage On Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kevin-durand-marton-csokas-dakota-goyo-book-passage-on-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120719|publisher=indiewire.com|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=July 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722035655/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kevin-durand-marton-csokas-dakota-goyo-book-passage-on-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120719|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naameh]], Noah's wife, and the only descendant of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] who was righteous<ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Jennifer Connelly Officially In Talks For Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/jennifer-connelly-officially-in-talks-for-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120618|publisher=indiewire.com|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=June 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622015049/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/jennifer-connelly-officially-in-talks-for-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120618|archive-date=June 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Emma Watson]] as Ila, Noah's adopted daughter-in-law and [[wives aboard Noah's Ark|Shem's wife]]\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as [[Tubal-cain]], Noah's nemesis and descendant of Cain<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web |last= Child |first= Ben|title=Ray Winstone set to star opposite Russell Crowe in Noah's ark epic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/12/ray-winstone-russell-crowe-noahs-ark|work=The Guardian|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/story/2012-08-09/noah-crowe-aronofsky/56922916/1|title='Noah' director Aronofsky tweets up a storm |last=Truitt |first=Brian |work= [[USA Today]]|date=August 10, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/58454/emma-watson-shares-updates-on-bling-ring-noah-and-50-shades|title=Emma Watson shares updates on 'Bling Ring,' 'Noah' and '50 Shades'|last=Nepales|first=Ruben V|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=September 15, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref>\n** [[Finn Wittrock]] as a young Tubal-cain<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/movies/russell-crowe-confronts-lifes-nasty-weather-in-noah.html|title=Russell Crowe Confronts Life's Nasty Weather in 'Noah'|first=A.

Years later, an adult Noah lives with his wife [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naameh]] and their sons [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], and [[Japheth]]. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather [[Methuselah]].\n\nThey encounter a group of people recently killed and take in and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. Ila is treated for an abdominal wound and will survive, but Naameh determines that she will be unable to have children. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the [[fallen angel]]s known as the \"Watchers\", in whose territory Methuselah lives. The Watchers are confined on Earth as creatures of stone for helping humans banished from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. After a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an [[Noah's Ark|ark]].\n\nAfter birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are sedated with incense.\n\nWith Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth but, seeing the settlers selling their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the Creator wants all of humanity dead. He tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations.\n\nDevastated that he will be alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but, when he will not, she goes to Methuselah for help. Ila encounters Methuselah who cures her infertility. Ham, searching for a wife on his own, befriends the refugee Na'el.\n\nAfter it starts raining, Tubal-cain becomes angry that he was not chosen to be saved and incites his followers to make a run for the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest and forces Ham to save himself, but leaves Na'el to die when she is caught in an animal trap. Noah's family enter the ark except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers fight off Tubal-cain and his mob of followers, sacrificing themselves and ascending to heaven, their reward for protecting Noah. As the flood drowns the remaining humans, an injured Tubal-cain climbs onto the ark and solicits Ham, playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Na'el to die.\n\nIla discovers she is pregnant as the rains stop and begs the Creator to let the child live. Noah interprets the ending of the rain to mean he must ensure the extinction of humans and, against his wife's protests, resolves that, if the child is a girl, he will kill her. Nine months later, Ila and Shem build a raft to escape Noah's resolve, but Noah discovers and burns it. Ila then starts feeling labor pains and gives birth to twin girls. After Ham calls Noah telling him the beasts are awake and eating each other, Tubal-cain emerges and attempts to hit Noah. Noah and Tubal-cain engage in combat. Shem promises Ila that Noah will not harm their daughters and goes to stop him. He attacks Noah as Tubal-cain falls to the ground only to be knocked out. Tubal-cain eventually forces Noah to the edge of the raft, but Ham kills him with a dagger before he can shove Noah in the ocean. Noah picks himself up and finds Ila and the babies, intending to kill the children, but spares them upon looking at his granddaughters and only feeling love.\n\nUpon exiting the ark on the new land, a shameful Noah goes into isolation in a nearby cave, making wine in which to drown his sorrows. Ham expresses disappointment for his father's current state of unseemly drunkenness and nakedness before leaving his kin to live alone.

Astorga]] (then Vice Mayor of Manila) on June 24, 1962. It has been annually commemorated under the [[patron saint|patronage]] of [[John the Baptist]], and has always been declared by the national government as a special non-working holiday through Presidential Proclamations. Each of the city's 896 barangays also have their own festivities guided by their own [[patron saint]].\n\nThe city is also the host to the [[Black Nazarene|Procession of the Feast of the Black Nazarene]] (''Traslac\u00edon''), held every January 9, which draws millions of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] devotees. Other religious festivities held in Manila are the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o in Tondo and Pandacan held on the third Sunday of January, the Feast of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Desamparados de Manila (Our Lady of the Abandoned), the patron saint of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] which was held every May 12, and the ''[[Flores de Mayo]]''.

The historic Walled City is administered by the [[Intramuros Administration]], while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies. The barangays that have jurisdictions over these places only oversee the welfare of the city's constituents and cannot exercise their executive powers. Manila has a total of 15,489 personnel complement by the end of 2018.<ref name=\"2018audit\" />\n\nThe current [[Mayor of Manila|mayor]] is Francisco \"[[Isko Moreno]]\" Domagoso, who previously served as the city's vice mayor. The current vice mayor is Dr. Maria Shielah \"Honey\" Lacuna-Pangan, daughter of former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Lacuna. The mayor and the vice mayor are term-limited by up to 3 terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.\n\n[[File:Palacio Del Gobernador.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio del Gobernador]] in Intramuros is home to the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] and Intramuros Administration.]]\nManila, being the seat of political power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington, D.C.]] These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].\n\nA new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.\n\nThe city, as the capital, still hosts the Office of the President, as well as the president's official residence. Aside from these, important government agencies and institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget and Management]], [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] and [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Public Works and Highways]] still call the city home. Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.\n\nCongress previously held office at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] at reclaimed land at [[Pasay]].

Museums established or run by educational institutions are the [[Mabini Shrine (Manila)|Mabini Shrine]], the DLS-CSB Museum of Contemporary Art and Design, [[UST Museum of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[University of the Philippines Museum of a History of Ideas|UP Museum of a History of Ideas]].\n[[File:National Museum of Natural History (Manila) Facade - Front View.jpg|thumb|left|The [[National Museum of Natural History (Manila)|National Museum of Natural History]] at Agrifina Circle, [[Rizal Park]].]]\n\n[[Bahay Tsinoy]], one of Manila's most prominent museums, documents the Chinese lives and contributions in the history of the Philippines. The Intramuros Light and Sound Museum chronicles the Filipinos desire for freedom during [[Philippine Revolution|the revolution]] under Rizal's leadership and other revolutionary leaders. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Manila]] is a museum of modern and contemporary visual arts exhibits the Filipino arts and [[Culture of the Philippines|culture]].\n\nOther museums in the city are the Museum of Manila, the city-owned museum that exhibits the city's culture and history, [[Museo Pambata]], a children's museum and a place of hands-on discovery and fun learning, and Plaza San Luis which is an outdoor heritage public museum that contains a collection of nine Spanish Bahay na Bat\u00f3 houses. Ecclesiastical museums in the located in the city are the Parish of the Our Lady of the Abandoned in Santa Ana, the [[San Agustin Church (Manila)|San Agustin Church Museum]] and the [[Museo de Intramuros]] which houses the ecclesiastical art collection of the [[Intramuros Administration]] in the reconstructed [[San Ignacio Church (Manila)|San Ignacio Church and Convent]].\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Rizal_Memorial_Sports_Complex_birdseye.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city-owned [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]], considered as the national sports complex of the Philippines.]]\n[[File:Basketball in Intramuros.jpg|thumb|Children playing basketball at the ruins of [[San Ignacio Church (Manila)|San Ignacio Church]] in Intramuros]]\n[[File:Intramurosjf0400 16.JPG|thumb|The Intramuros Golf Club]]\n\nSports in Manila have a long and distinguished history. The city's, and in general the country's main sport is [[basketball]], and most barangays have a basketball court or at least a makeshift basketball court, with court markings drawn on the streets. Larger barangays have covered courts where inter-barangay leagues are held every summer (April to May). Manila has many sports venues, such as the [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]] and San Andres Gym, the home of the now defunct [[Manila Metrostars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Manila-Sports.html |title=Manila: Sports |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex houses the [[Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium]], [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium|the Baseball Stadium]], Tennis Courts, the [[Rizal Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Ninoy Aquino Stadium]] (the latter two are indoor arenas). The Rizal complex had hosted several multi-sport events, such as the [[1954 Asian Games]] and the [[1934 Far Eastern Games]]. Whenever the country hosts the [[Southeast Asian Games]], most of the events are held at the complex, but in the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 Games]], most events were held elsewhere. The [[1960 ABC Championship]] and the [[1973 ABC Championship]], forerunners of the [[FIBA Asia Championship]], was hosted by the memorial coliseum, with the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|national basketball team]] winning on both tournaments. The [[1978 FIBA World Championship]] was held at the coliseum although the latter stages were held in the [[Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena at that time.\n\nManila also hosts several well-known sports facilities such as the [[Enrique M. Razon Sports Center]] and the [[University of Santo Tomas Sports Complex]], both of which are private venues owned by a university; collegiate sports are also held, with the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] basketball games held at Rizal Memorial Coliseum and Ninoy Aquino Stadium, although basketball events had transferred to [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]'s [[Filoil Flying V Arena]] and the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Other collegiate sports are still held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Professional basketball also used to play at the city, but the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] now holds their games at Araneta Coliseum and [[Cuneta Astrodome]] at [[Pasay]]; the now defunct [[Philippine Basketball League]] played some of their games at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.\n\nThe [[Manila Storm]] are the city's [[rugby league]] team training at Rizal Park (Luneta Park) and playing their matches at Southern Plains Field, [[Calamba, Laguna]]. Previously a widely played sport in the city, Manila is now the home of the only sizable [[baseball]] stadium in the country, at the [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium]]. The stadium hosts games of [[Baseball Philippines]]; [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Babe Ruth]] were the first players to score a [[home run]] at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2, 1934.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |title=Baseball loses no time in preparing for SEAG |first=Tito |last=Talao |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=March 10, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913053124/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |archivedate=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2014}}</ref> Another popular sport in the city are [[cue sports]], and billiard halls are a feature in most barangays.

Manila Day, which celebrates the city's founding on June 24, 1571 by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]], was first proclaimed by [[Herminio A. Astorga]] (then Vice Mayor of Manila) on June 24, 1962. It has been annually commemorated under the [[patron saint|patronage]] of [[John the Baptist]], and has always been declared by the national government as a special non-working holiday through Presidential Proclamations. Each of the city's 896 barangays also have their own festivities guided by their own [[patron saint]].\n\nThe city is also the host to the [[Black Nazarene|Procession of the Feast of the Black Nazarene]] (''Traslac\u00edon''), held every January 9, which draws millions of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] devotees. Other religious festivities held in Manila are the Feast of Santo Ni\u00f1o in Tondo and Pandacan held on the third Sunday of January, the Feast of the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Desamparados de Manila (Our Lady of the Abandoned), the patron saint of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] which was held every May 12, and the ''[[Flores de Mayo]]''. Non-religious holidays include the [[New Year's Day]], [[National Heroes' Day]], [[Bonifacio Day]] and [[Rizal Day]].\n\n==Law and government==\n[[File:Intramurosjf0305 17.JPG|thumb|left|[[Manila City Hall]], the seat of city government.]]\n\nManila\u2014officially known as the City of Manila\u2014is the [[capital city|national capital]] of the Philippines and is classified as a Special City (according to its income)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blgf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/updated-reclassification-Cities.pdf |title= Income Classification Per DOF Order No. 23-08, dated July 29, 2008 |publisher= Bureau of Local Government Finance |access-date= December 31, 2016 |website=  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231151123/http://blgf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/updated-reclassification-Cities.pdf |archive-date= December 31, 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Manual-on-PCC-Chapter-9.pdf|title=Position Classification and Compensation Scheme in Local Government Units|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Budget and Management|access-date=}}</ref> and a [[Cities of the Philippines#classification|Highly Urbanized City]] (HUC).

The members of the City Council are elected as representatives of specific congressional districts within the city. The city, however, have no control over Intramuros and the Manila North Harbor. The historic Walled City is administered by the [[Intramuros Administration]], while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies. The barangays that have jurisdictions over these places only oversee the welfare of the city's constituents and cannot exercise their executive powers. Manila has a total of 15,489 personnel complement by the end of 2018.<ref name=\"2018audit\" />\n\nThe current [[Mayor of Manila|mayor]] is Francisco \"[[Isko Moreno]]\" Domagoso, who previously served as the city's vice mayor. The current vice mayor is Dr. Maria Shielah \"Honey\" Lacuna-Pangan, daughter of former Manila Vice Mayor Danny Lacuna. The mayor and the vice mayor are term-limited by up to 3 terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.\n\n[[File:Palacio Del Gobernador.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palacio del Gobernador]] in Intramuros is home to the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] and Intramuros Administration.]]\nManila, being the seat of political power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonization]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the Rizal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington, D.C.]] These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of [[Manuel L. Quezon]].\n\nA new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations.\n\nThe city, as the capital, still hosts the Office of the President, as well as the president's official residence. Aside from these, important government agencies and institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget and Management]], [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]] and [[Department of Public Works and Highways|Public Works and Highways]] still call the city home. Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.\n\nCongress previously held office at the [[Old Legislative Building (Manila)|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] at reclaimed land at [[Pasay]]. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] will also transfer to its new campus at [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Taguig]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/608294/sc-picks-phl-flag-inspired-design-for-new-green-building-in-taguig/story|title=SC picks PHL flag-inspired design for new 'green' building in Taguig|last=Lopez|first=Virgil|date=April 25, 2017|website=GMA News|access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Finance ===\n\nIn the 2018 Annual Audit Report published by the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]], it is stated that the total revenue of the City of Manila amounts to \u20b114.1 billion.<ref name=\"2018audit\">{{cite web |url=https://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2018/category/7732-cities |title= 2018 Annual Audit Reports |publisher=[[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]] |accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref> It is one of the cities with the highest tax collection and internal revenue allotment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philippinestodayus.com/news/metro/quezon-city-makati-richest-cities-in-rp/ |title=Quezon City, Makati richest cities in RP |publisher=Philippine Today US |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024161259/http://www.philippinestodayus.com/news/metro/quezon-city-makati-richest-cities-in-rp/ |archivedate=October 24, 2011  }}</ref> Manila collects an annual tax revenue amounting to \u20b17.3 billion.
