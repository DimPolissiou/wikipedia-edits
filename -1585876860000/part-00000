In the 1850 census, Phillips is recorded for the first time under the profession of portrait painter, now living in North East, New York.

Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits, a luxury good, was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref> Such comments from a well established academic painter such as Vanderlyn positions Phillips not as a wandering peddler of art, but instead as an artist with social and economic importance. This is also visible in his  clientele, which consisted of judges, doctors and business owners.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Black|first=Mary|title=Ammi Phillips: Portrait Painter 1788 - 1865|publisher=Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life.\n\n==''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog''==\n[[File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ammi Phillips, ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', 1830-1835]]The artist's most famous work is ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', which is in the collection of the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.

The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits, a luxury good, was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the [[Hudson River Valley]]. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \"likenesses\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist [[John Vanderlyn]] to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\"<ref>Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14.</ref> Such comments from a well established academic painter such as Vanderlyn positions Phillips not as a wandering peddler of art, but instead as an artist with social and economic importance. This is also visible in his  clientele, which consisted of judges, doctors and business owners.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Black|first=Mary|title=Ammi Phillips: Portrait Painter 1788 - 1865|publisher=Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nWe may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic [[Hilton Kramer]], who wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1970, \"In the ''Plain and Fancy'' exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865), and at least two of them\u2014the portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)\u2014are of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\"\n\nAmmi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life.\n\n==''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog''==\n[[File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788\u20131865).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ammi Phillips, ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', 1830-1835]]The artist's most famous work is ''Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog'', which is in the collection of the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in New York.

The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \"Kent Limner\", after the locality where they had come to light.<ref name=\"Black1976\"/>\n\nStylistically distinct from those of the \"Kent Limner\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut\u2013[[New York (state)|New York]] border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \"Border Limner\", these works, dating from the period 1812\u20131819, were characterized by soft [[pastel]] hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of ''Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby'', now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of ''Harriet Leavens'', now in the [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"Mills\">Mills, Sally. \"Phillips, Ammi.\" ''Grove Art Online.

Along with [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] (US 20), [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]], and [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Interstate 90]], Route 9 is one of the major east\u2013west routes of Massachusetts, and like the others its eastern terminus is in [[Boston]]. Starting at [[Copley Square]] and passing along [[Huntington Avenue]], Route 9 is a limited access route through the [[MetroWest]] suburbs to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and is also a major alternative to the Pike's [[toll road]] west of the city. After passing along major city streets in Worcester, the road becomes a country route, passing through the central Worcester Hills, the [[Pioneer Valley]], and the city of [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and into [[The Berkshires]]. The road ends near the center of the city of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]].\n\n==Route description==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nRoute 9 passes through six counties and twenty-eight cities and towns.  It begins in the western Massachusetts city of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], at [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]]. After separating from US-20, it has a brief .2 mile concurrency with [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]] through the center of that city, then continues east, passing through the towns of Dalton and Windsor, wherein the route reaches its highest point at 2033&nbsp;ft, in [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire County]].  It continues its winding pass through the small towns of [[The Berkshires]] in Berkshire and western [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire]] Counties before passing through the center of [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], passing [[Smith College]] before its first interstate junction, at [[Interstate 91]].  It then crosses the [[Connecticut River]] at the [[Calvin Coolidge Bridge]], just downstream from Elwell Island.  It goes past the retail area of Hadley before passing the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and [[Amherst College]].  From Amherst, it winds its way into western [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]], south of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]], through small towns until it makes its way into the city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]].\n\nOnce in Worcester, Route 9 becomes a major thoroughfare through the city, as Park Avenue, Highland Street (which passes Major Taylor Boulevard), before passing over [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] and Belmont Street, where [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]] and the former [[Worcester State Hospital]] are located. At its intersection with McRae Ct., it becomes a divided highway with raised median.  From Worcester, it crosses [[Lake Quinsigamond]] into Shrewsbury.  At this point, Route 9 becomes the main retail artery of the [[MetroWest]] region.  Several plazas and chain stores are located along the route as it makes its way towards Northborough, where it crosses [[U.S. Route 20]]; Westborough, where it crosses [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]]; and eventually in the [[Golden Triangle (Massachusetts)|Golden Triangle]] retail area of Framingham and Natick, after crossing the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].  It passes [[Shoppers World (Framingham, Massachusetts)|Shopper's World]] and the [[Natick Mall]], New England's largest mall.\n\nBeginning in the Golden Triangle, Route 9 becomes one of the major routes into Boston, serving as a valuable bypass to the Mass Pike and its tolls.  It crosses [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] (also known as [[Massachusetts Route 128]]) in Wellesley before crossing the [[Charles River]] into Newton and Brookline.  It enters the city of Boston by crossing over Brookline's former namesake, the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]], part of the [[Emerald Necklace]].  at this point it becomes [[Huntington Avenue]], also known as \"Avenue of the Arts.\"  It loses its raised median briefly between its intersection with S. Huntington Ave. and Brigham Circle.  It passes the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]], which includes [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Harvard Medical School]] and other hospitals; the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]]; and several colleges and universities, including [[Northeastern University]].  This stretch is also a major site of baseball history; the first game of the [[1903 World Series]], baseball's first true World Series, was played at the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the original home of the [[Boston Red Sox]].  (The site is now part of Northeastern's campus.)  The \"E\" Branch of the MBTA Green Line roughly follows Huntington Avenue underground from Copley Square until it rises above ground at the Northeastern Portal. It then operates in a dedicated median of Huntington Avenue between Northeastern University and the Brigham Circle stop, where trains begin street running in mixed traffic to a terminus at Heath Street. Route 9 continues past [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] and [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]], which is the mother church of [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science]].  It then passes [[Copley Place]] and the [[Prudential Tower|Prudential Center complex]], before splitting, the eastbound half onto Stuart Street, the westbound onto Saint James Street, past [[Copley Square]]; both the eastbound and westbound segments of Route 9 end at [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]].\n\n==History==\nRoute 9 was established in 1933. It took over the alignment of what was Route 115 from Kenmore Square in Boston to Route 22 in [[North Grafton, Massachusetts|North Grafton]], part of the original route of US 20 between North Grafton and [[West Brookfield, Massachusetts|West Brookfield]] and the original Route 109 between West Brookfield and US 7 in Pittsfield. Route 9's original route in Boston was along Brookline Avenue from Kenmore Square turning west onto its current path along Boylston Street.<ref>Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Works, 1932 Road Map and Detour Bulletin.</ref> Between [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Route 9 follows the path of the 19th-century '''Worcester Turnpike''', opened in 1810. This route originally included a [[pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] over [[Lake Quinsigamond]] in [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]]. From Dalton to Goshen in the Berkshires, the road follows the old Berkshire Trail.  The massive expansion of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] transformed that part of Route 9 in the late 20th century; this otherwise rural part of the route now has several shops, restaurants, and the mid-sized [[Hampshire Mall]]. In the 20th century, Route 9 became the focus for [[urban sprawl]] in towns like [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] and [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]]. Further west, in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], Route 9 was home to one of the first modern [[shopping mall]]s, the aptly named [[Shopper's World|Shoppers' World]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], Route 9 is officially the \"Ted Williams Highway\", named after the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] sports legend [[Ted Williams]], who sported that number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/natick/gallery/route9?pg=7 |title=Route 9 through the years |url-status=live |accessdate=2012-08-12}}</ref> In [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], it is officially the \"United Spanish War Veterans Highway\".\n\nFrom 1903 to 1932, the [[Boston and Worcester Street Railway]] ran mostly via Route 9.

Along with [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] (US 20), [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]], and [[Massachusetts Turnpike|Interstate 90]], Route 9 is one of the major east\u2013west routes of Massachusetts, and like the others its eastern terminus is in [[Boston]]. Starting at [[Copley Square]] and passing along [[Huntington Avenue]], Route 9 is a limited access route through the [[MetroWest]] suburbs to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and is also a major alternative to the Pike's [[toll road]] west of the city. After passing along major city streets in Worcester, the road becomes a country route, passing through the central Worcester Hills, the [[Pioneer Valley]], and the city of [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and into [[The Berkshires]]. The road ends near the center of the city of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]].\n\n==Route description==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nRoute 9 passes through six counties and twenty-eight cities and towns.  It begins in the western Massachusetts city of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], at [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]]. After separating from US-20, it has a brief .2 mile concurrency with [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]] through the center of that city, then continues east, passing through the towns of Dalton and Windsor, wherein the route reaches its highest point at 2033&nbsp;ft, in [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire County]].  It continues its winding pass through the small towns of [[The Berkshires]] in Berkshire and western [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire]] Counties before passing through the center of [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], passing [[Smith College]] before its first interstate junction, at [[Interstate 91]].  It then crosses the [[Connecticut River]] at the [[Calvin Coolidge Bridge]], just downstream from Elwell Island.  It goes past the retail area of Hadley before passing the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and [[Amherst College]].  From Amherst, it winds its way into western [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]], south of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]], through small towns until it makes its way into the city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]].\n\nOnce in Worcester, Route 9 becomes a major thoroughfare through the city, as Park Avenue, Highland Street (which passes Major Taylor Boulevard), before passing over [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] and Belmont Street, where [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]] and the former [[Worcester State Hospital]] are located. At its intersection with McRae Ct., it becomes a divided highway with raised median.  From Worcester, it crosses [[Lake Quinsigamond]] into Shrewsbury.  At this point, Route 9 becomes the main retail artery of the [[MetroWest]] region.  Several plazas and chain stores are located along the route as it makes its way towards Northborough, where it crosses [[U.S. Route 20]]; Westborough, where it crosses [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]]; and eventually in the [[Golden Triangle (Massachusetts)|Golden Triangle]] retail area of Framingham and Natick, after crossing the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].  It passes [[Shoppers World (Framingham, Massachusetts)|Shopper's World]] and the [[Natick Mall]], New England's largest mall.\n\nBeginning in the Golden Triangle, Route 9 becomes one of the major routes into Boston, serving as a valuable bypass to the Mass Pike and its tolls.  It crosses [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] (also known as [[Massachusetts Route 128]]) in Wellesley before crossing the [[Charles River]] into Newton and Brookline.  It enters the city of Boston by crossing over Brookline's former namesake, the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]], part of the [[Emerald Necklace]].  at this point it becomes [[Huntington Avenue]], also known as \"Avenue of the Arts.\"  It loses its raised median briefly between its intersection with S. Huntington Ave. and Brigham Circle.  It passes the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]], which includes [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Harvard Medical School]] and other hospitals; the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]]; and several colleges and universities, including [[Northeastern University]].  This stretch is also a major site of baseball history; the first game of the [[1903 World Series]], baseball's first true World Series, was played at the [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the original home of the [[Boston Red Sox]].  (The site is now part of Northeastern's campus.)  The \"E\" Branch of the MBTA Green Line roughly follows Huntington Avenue underground from Copley Square until it rises above ground at the Northeastern Portal. It then operates in a dedicated median of Huntington Avenue between Northeastern University and the Brigham Circle stop, where trains begin street running in mixed traffic to a terminus at Heath Street. Route 9 continues past [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] and [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist]], which is the mother church of [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science]].  It then passes [[Copley Place]] and the [[Prudential Tower|Prudential Center complex]], before splitting, the eastbound half onto Stuart Street, the westbound onto Saint James Street, past [[Copley Square]]; both the eastbound and westbound segments of Route 9 end at [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]].\n\n==History==\nRoute 9 was established in 1933. It took over the alignment of what was Route 115 from Kenmore Square in Boston to Route 22 in [[North Grafton, Massachusetts|North Grafton]], part of the original route of US 20 between North Grafton and [[West Brookfield, Massachusetts|West Brookfield]] and the original Route 109 between West Brookfield and US 7 in Pittsfield. Route 9's original route in Boston was along Brookline Avenue from Kenmore Square turning west onto its current path along Boylston Street.<ref>Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Public Works, 1932 Road Map and Detour Bulletin.</ref> Between [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Route 9 follows the path of the 19th-century '''Worcester Turnpike''', opened in 1810. This route originally included a [[pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] over [[Lake Quinsigamond]] in [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]]. From Dalton to Goshen in the Berkshires, the road follows the old Berkshire Trail.  The massive expansion of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] transformed that part of Route 9 in the late 20th century; this otherwise rural part of the route now has several shops, restaurants, and the mid-sized [[Hampshire Mall]]. In the 20th century, Route 9 became the focus for [[urban sprawl]] in towns like [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] and [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]]. Further west, in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], Route 9 was home to one of the first modern [[shopping mall]]s, the aptly named [[Shopper's World|Shoppers' World]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], Route 9 is officially the \"Ted Williams Highway\", named after the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] sports legend [[Ted Williams]], who sported that number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/natick/gallery/route9?pg=7 |title=Route 9 through the years |url-status=live |accessdate=2012-08-12}}</ref> In [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], it is officially the \"United Spanish War Veterans Highway\".\n\nFrom 1903 to 1932, the [[Boston and Worcester Street Railway]] ran mostly via Route 9.
