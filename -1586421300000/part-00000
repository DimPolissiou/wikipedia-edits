In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed. However [[Scotland]] is not a member of [[World Sailing]] they Nationals are listed any way since the event is listed under National Championships in the Soling Guide of 1996-2000. <ref name=\"SolingGuide1996\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Winners of National Championships ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed. However [[Scotland]] is not a member of [[World Sailing]] they Nationals are listed any way since the event is listed under National Championships in the Soling Guide of 1996-2000. <ref name=\"SolingGuide1996\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Winners of National Championships ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

The division is a unit of the German Army's '''stabilization forces''' and specializes in [[Low intensity conflict|conflicts of low intensity]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:M\u00fctzenabzeichen Gebirgsj\u00e4ger Bw.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The ''Edelweiss'' badge of the German mountain infantry]]\n\nThis division was founded as the ''10. Panzerdivision'' of the new German Army in 1959. Originally only consisting of armoured units, it now also commands Germany's last [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger|mountain warfare]] unit. For this reason the ''[[Edelweiss]]'' badge has become another commonly used insignia to denote allegiance to this formation. The 10th Panzer Division is a part of Germany's permanent contribution to [[Eurocorps]], the other being the German contribution to the [[Franco-German Brigade]] which was subordinate to the division until 2006.\n\nAfter 1993 troops of this division participated in numerous overseas deployments. Among them were the first out-of-area land deployment operations for the ''Bundeswehr'' (in fact of any German military unit after World War II). Troops were deployed to Somalia ([[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UNOSOM II]]) from 1993 to 1994 and to Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[IFOR]]) from 1995 to 1996 and stayed in this country until 1998 ([[SFOR]]). Soldiers of the 10th Armoured Division's SFOR contingent were also involved in the ''Bundeswehr'''s first combat operation in 1997 ([[Operation Libelle]]). In 2000, the 10th Armoured Division deployed more than 8,000 personnel to the [[Balkans]]. Between 2002 and 2003, it deployed to various operations in the Balkans and in [[Afghanistan]].\n\nIn 2017, the [[4th Rapid Deployment Brigade (Czech Republic)|4th Rapid Deployment Brigade]] of the [[Czech Land Forces]] started to \u2033work closely\u2033 with the division.<ref>{{cite web|title=Germany, Romania and the Czech Republic deepen defence ties|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_141113.htm|website=NATO|publisher=NATO|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wirnitzer|first1=Jan|title=\u010ce\u0161i \u010del\u00ed rusk\u00e9 propagand\u011b o p\u0159ed\u00e1n\u00ed 4. brig\u00e1dy N\u011bmc\u016fm.

Panzerdivision|url=http://www.deutschesheer.de/portal/a/10div/|publisher=Heer|accessdate=2013-01-21}}</ref> \nIts staff is based at [[Veitsh\u00f6chheim]]. The division is a unit of the German Army's '''stabilization forces''' and specializes in [[Low intensity conflict|conflicts of low intensity]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:M\u00fctzenabzeichen Gebirgsj\u00e4ger Bw.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The ''Edelweiss'' badge of the German mountain infantry]]\n\nThis division was founded as the ''10. Panzerdivision'' of the new German Army in 1959. Originally only consisting of armoured units, it now also commands Germany's last [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger|mountain warfare]] unit. For this reason the ''[[Edelweiss]]'' badge has become another commonly used insignia to denote allegiance to this formation. The 10th Panzer Division is a part of Germany's permanent contribution to [[Eurocorps]], the other being the German contribution to the [[Franco-German Brigade]] which was subordinate to the division until 2006.\n\nAfter 1993 troops of this division participated in numerous overseas deployments. Among them were the first out-of-area land deployment operations for the ''Bundeswehr'' (in fact of any German military unit after World War II). Troops were deployed to Somalia ([[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UNOSOM II]]) from 1993 to 1994 and to Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[IFOR]]) from 1995 to 1996 and stayed in this country until 1998 ([[SFOR]]). Soldiers of the 10th Armoured Division's SFOR contingent were also involved in the ''Bundeswehr'''s first combat operation in 1997 ([[Operation Libelle]]). In 2000, the 10th Armoured Division deployed more than 8,000 personnel to the [[Balkans]]. Between 2002 and 2003, it deployed to various operations in the Balkans and in [[Afghanistan]].\n\nIn 2017, the [[4th Rapid Deployment Brigade (Czech Republic)|4th Rapid Deployment Brigade]] of the [[Czech Land Forces]] started to \u2033work closely\u2033 with the division.<ref>{{cite web|title=Germany, Romania and the Czech Republic deepen defence ties|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_141113.htm|website=NATO|publisher=NATO|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wirnitzer|first1=Jan|title=\u010ce\u0161i \u010del\u00ed rusk\u00e9 propagand\u011b o p\u0159ed\u00e1n\u00ed 4. brig\u00e1dy N\u011bmc\u016fm.

Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The \"human soap\" rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as ''{{lang|de|Rein-Judisches-Fett}}'' (\"Pure Jewish Fat\"); in [[Blackletter#Fraktur|German Blackletter]] font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for ''{{lang|de|Reichsstelle f\u00fcr industrielle Fettversorgung}}'' (\"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning\", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waxman |first=Zo\u00eb |authorlink=|title=Writing the Holocaust: Identity, Testimony, Representation |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-920638-4 |page=168}}</ref> \n\nRumors about the origins and meaning of \"RIF\" soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book ''Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia'', describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters \"RIF\" inscribed on a center depression. These were claimed to be made out of only \"''{{lang|de|Rein Judisches Fett}}''\" (pure Jewish fat) when prisoners complained about the low-foam, smooth soap. A version of the story is included in ''[[Black Book (World War II)|The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry]]'', one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the [[Holocaust]], assembled by Soviet writers [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]]. The specific story is part of a report titled \"The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov\" attributed to I. Herts and Naftali Nakht:\n\n{{quote|In another section of the Belzec camp was an enormous soap factory. The Germans picked out the fattest Jews, murdered them, and boiled them down for soap.

However, the IPN maintained that human fat was used, based on testimonies which were delivered in 1945 and the presence of [[kaolin]] in the samples, the abrasive qualities of which indicated its possible use as a cleaning soap.<ref name=TomSem/> Tomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w's research, however, concluded that Spanner, a well-respected physician who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939, would not have been \"experimenting\" with soap production (which was widely understood and not something which needed experimentation) instead of teaching his students, and that the soapy grease (claimed to be \"unfinished soap\"<ref name=Neander/>), a by-product stemming from [[Maceration (bone)|bone maceration]] in the creation of anatomical models for the institute, was injected into the models flexible joints.<ref name=TomSem/> They further noted that Spanner had previously done research on kaolin injections into cadavers, and stated that the kaolin could have come from the cadaver itself, rather than from a later additive.<ref name=TomSem/>\n\nBoth Neander, and Tomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w, state that the origin of this myth comes from the findings of bodies and maceration processes in a small brick building on the premise the anatomical institute which was used by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and the newly established Polish [[Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation]] as \"proof\" of human soap production in concentration camps, which had been presented as fact and had also become a stock phrase in Soviet propaganda, but of which no evidence could be found in the liberated camps. The \"human soap\" which was found in Danzig was conflated with the separate rumors regarding the concentration camps and they were presented together during the Nuremberg trials.<ref name=Neander/><ref name=TomSem/> Neander concludes that no research, experiments or production on soap-making were conducted in Danzig, that Manzur never made soap according to his \"recipe\", that the corpses which were delivered to be boiled and turned into anatomical models were all the corpses of Germans who had not been killed in order to \"harvest\" their bodies. However, his research did prove that towards the end of the war, the grease was used for simple cleaning purposes and that Spanner bore responsibility for this, whether he was aware of it or not, as head of the institute, but that the handling of dead bodies amounted to a [[misdemeanor]], as opposed to any criminal behavior, let alone a crime against humanity or involvement in any genocidal activities, something which is today officially acknowledged in Poland.<ref name=Neander/>\n\nTomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w write that when [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska]], Vice-Chairperson of the Chief Commission, was already writing her short-story \"Professor Spanner\" (which would be published in ''Medaliony''), Spanner was again working as a medical doctor, under his own name, in [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]] in September 1945, unaware that he was being linked to any possible crimes. He was arrested in May 1947, but was released three days later. Later he was arrested again, but he was once again released after explaining how he had conducted the maceration and injection process. He was officially exonerated in 1948 and resumed his academic career.<ref name=TomSem/>\nNeander states: {{quote|The time therefore has come to reduce the \"Danzig Soap Case,\" inflated by postwar propaganda to a prime example of Nazi German crimes, to its real\ndimensions. \"Revisionists\" would lose one of their favorite \"arguments\" in their efforts to discredit serious Holocaust scholarship.

Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The \"human soap\" rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as ''{{lang|de|Rein-Judisches-Fett}}'' (\"Pure Jewish Fat\"); in [[Blackletter#Fraktur|German Blackletter]] font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for ''{{lang|de|Reichsstelle f\u00fcr industrielle Fettversorgung}}'' (\"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning\", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waxman |first=Zo\u00eb |authorlink=|title=Writing the Holocaust: Identity, Testimony, Representation |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-920638-4 |page=168}}</ref> \n\nRumors about the origins and meaning of \"RIF\" soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book ''Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia'', describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters \"RIF\" inscribed on a center depression. These were claimed to be made out of only \"''{{lang|de|Rein Judisches Fett}}''\" (pure Jewish fat) when prisoners complained about the low-foam, smooth soap. A version of the story is included in ''[[Black Book (World War II)|The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry]]'', one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the [[Holocaust]], assembled by Soviet writers [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Vasily Grossman]]. The specific story is part of a report titled \"The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov\" attributed to I. Herts and Naftali Nakht:\n\n{{quote|In another section of the Belzec camp was an enormous soap factory. The Germans picked out the fattest Jews, murdered them, and boiled them down for soap.

However, the IPN maintained that human fat was used, based on testimonies which were delivered in 1945 and the presence of [[kaolin]] in the samples, the abrasive qualities of which indicated its possible use as a cleaning soap.<ref name=TomSem/> Tomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w's research, however, concluded that Spanner, a well-respected physician who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939, would not have been \"experimenting\" with soap production (which was widely understood and not something which needed experimentation) instead of teaching his students, and that the soapy grease (claimed to be \"unfinished soap\"<ref name=Neander/>), a by-product stemming from [[Maceration (bone)|bone maceration]] in the creation of anatomical models for the institute, was injected into the models flexible joints.<ref name=TomSem/> They further noted that Spanner had previously done research on kaolin injections into cadavers, and stated that the kaolin could have come from the cadaver itself, rather than from a later additive.<ref name=TomSem/>\n\nBoth Neander, and Tomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w, state that the origin of this myth comes from the findings of bodies and maceration processes in a small brick building on the premise the anatomical institute which was used by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and the newly established Polish [[Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation]] as \"proof\" of human soap production in concentration camps, which had been presented as fact and had also become a stock phrase in Soviet propaganda, but of which no evidence could be found in the liberated camps. The \"human soap\" which was found in Danzig was conflated with the separate rumors regarding the concentration camps and they were presented together during the Nuremberg trials.<ref name=Neander/><ref name=TomSem/> Neander concludes that no research, experiments or production on soap-making were conducted in Danzig, that Manzur never made soap according to his \"recipe\", that the corpses which were delivered to be boiled and turned into anatomical models were all the corpses of Germans who had not been killed in order to \"harvest\" their bodies. However, his research did prove that towards the end of the war, the grease was used for simple cleaning purposes and that Spanner bore responsibility for this, whether he was aware of it or not, as head of the institute, but that the handling of dead bodies amounted to a [[misdemeanor]], as opposed to any criminal behavior, let alone a crime against humanity or involvement in any genocidal activities, something which is today officially acknowledged in Poland.<ref name=Neander/>\n\nTomkiewicz and Semk\u00f3w write that when [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska]], Vice-Chairperson of the Chief Commission, was already writing her short-story \"Professor Spanner\" (which would be published in ''Medaliony''), Spanner was again working as a medical doctor, under his own name, in [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]] in September 1945, unaware that he was being linked to any possible crimes. He was arrested in May 1947, but was released three days later. Later he was arrested again, but he was once again released after explaining how he had conducted the maceration and injection process. He was officially exonerated in 1948 and resumed his academic career.<ref name=TomSem/>\nNeander states: {{quote|The time therefore has come to reduce the \"Danzig Soap Case,\" inflated by postwar propaganda to a prime example of Nazi German crimes, to its real\ndimensions. \"Revisionists\" would lose one of their favorite \"arguments\" in their efforts to discredit serious Holocaust scholarship.
