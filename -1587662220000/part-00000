The [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Tennessee]] under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the river by capturing this stronghold and defeating [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[John C. Pemberton]]'s forces stationed there.\n\nThe campaign consisted of many important naval operations, troop maneuvers, failed initiatives, and eleven distinct battles from December 26, 1862, to July 4, 1863. Military historians divide the campaign into two formal phases: '''operations against Vicksburg''' (December&nbsp;1862&nbsp;\u2013 January&nbsp;1863) and '''Grant's operations against Vicksburg''' (March\u2013July 1863).\n\nGrant initially planned a two-pronged approach in which half of his army, under Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], would advance to the [[Yazoo River]] and attempt to reach Vicksburg from the northeast, while Grant took the remainder of the army down the Mississippi Central Railroad. Both of these initiatives failed. Grant conducted a number of \"experiments\" or expeditions\u2014Grant's bayou operations\u2014that attempted to enable waterborne access to the Mississippi south of Vicksburg's artillery batteries. All five of these initiatives failed as well. Finally, Union gunboats and troop transport boats ran the batteries at Vicksburg and met up with Grant's men who had marched overland in [[Louisiana]]. On April 29 and April 30, 1863, Grant's army crossed the Mississippi and landed at [[Bruinsburg, Mississippi]]. An elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions fooled the Confederates and the landings occurred without opposition. Over the next 17 days, Grant maneuvered his army inland and won five battles, captured the state capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and assaulted and laid siege to Vicksburg.\n\nAfter Pemberton's army surrendered on July 4 (one day after the Confederate defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]), and when [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] surrendered to Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] on July 9, Texas and Arkansas were effectively cut off from the Confederacy, and the Mississippi River was once again open for northern commerce to reach the Gulf of Mexico, and as a supply line for the Union Army. Grant's Vicksburg campaign is studied as a masterpiece of military operations and a major [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Military situation===\n{{Main article|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}{{further|American Civil War}}\n{| align=right\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Army commanders (Vicksburg campaign)\n|-\n|<gallery>\nImage:GenUSGrant.jpg|<center>Maj.

Pemberton]], CSA</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nVicksburg was strategically vital to the Confederates. [[Jefferson Davis]] said, \"Vicksburg is the nail head that holds the South's two halves together.\"<ref>Winschel, p. 14.</ref> While in their hands, it blocked Union navigation down the Mississippi; together with control of the mouth of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] to the south, it allowed communication with the states west of the river, upon which the Confederates depended extensively for horses, cattle and reinforcements. The natural defenses of the city were ideal, earning it the nickname \"The Gibraltar of the Confederacy\". It was located on a high bluff overlooking a horseshoe-shaped bend in the river, De Soto Peninsula, making it almost impossible to approach by ship. North and East of Vicksburg was the [[Mississippi Delta]] (sometimes known as the Yazoo Delta), an area 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) north to south and up to 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) across, which has been described by geographer Warren E. Grabau as an \"astonishingly complex network of intersecting waterways\", some of which were navigable by small steamboats. The regions between modern rivers and bayous formed closed basins called backswamps, of which Grabau judged, \"Whether permanently flooded or not, the backswamps were, for all practical purposes, untamed wildernesses, utterly impassable by a man on horseback or by any form of wheeled vehicle, and very difficult even for a man on foot.\"<ref>Grabau, p. 19.</ref> About twelve miles (19&nbsp;km) up the [[Yazoo River]] were Confederate batteries and entrenchments at Haynes Bluff. The [[Louisiana]] land west of Vicksburg was also difficult, with many streams and poor country roads, widespread winter flooding, and it was on the opposite side of the river from the fortress.\n\nThe city had been under Union naval attack before. Admiral [[David Farragut]] moved up the river after his [[capture of New Orleans]] and on May 18, 1862, demanded the surrender of Vicksburg. Farragut had insufficient troops to force the issue, and he moved back to New Orleans. He returned with a flotilla in June 1862, but their attempts (June 26\u201328) to bombard the fortress into surrender failed. They shelled Vicksburg throughout July and fought some minor battles with a few Confederate vessels in the area, but their forces were insufficient to attempt a landing, and they abandoned attempts to force the surrender of the city. Farragut investigated the possibility of bypassing the fortified cliffs by digging a canal across the neck of the river's bend, the De Soto Peninsula. On June 28, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Thomas Williams (general)|Thomas Williams]], attached to Farragut's command, began digging work on the canal by employing local laborers and some soldiers. Many of the men fell victim to tropical diseases and heat exhaustion, and the work was abandoned by July 24. (Williams was killed two weeks later in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Battle of Baton Rouge]]).<ref>Ballard, pp. 46\u201362; Bearss, vol. I, p. 437; [https://www.nps.gov/vick/learn/historyculture/grants-canal.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]] was promoted from command of the Western Theater to General-in-Chief of all Union armies. On November 23, he indicated to Grant his preference for a major move down the Mississippi to Vicksburg; in Halleck's style, he left considerable initiative to design a campaign, an opportunity that the pugnacious Grant seized. Halleck has received criticism for not moving promptly overland from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to seize Vicksburg during the summer when he was in command on the scene. He believed that the Navy could capture the fortress on its own, not knowing that the naval force was insufficiently manned with ground troops to finish the job. What might have achieved success in the summer of 1862 was no longer possible by November because the Confederates had amply reinforced the garrison by that time.  Also reliable navigation on the river was seasonal, and the natural fall in the level of the river during the fall and winter months limited the utility of shipping, the usable draft of riverboats, and the quantity of men, supplies, and equipment, they could transport.\n\nGrant's army marched south down the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]], making a forward base at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. He planned a two-pronged assault in the direction of Vicksburg. His principal subordinate, Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was to advance down the river with four divisions (about 32,000 men) and Grant would continue with the remaining forces (about 40,000) down the railroad line to [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he would wait for developments, hoping to lure the Confederate army out of the city to attack him in the vicinity of [[Grenada, Mississippi]].\n\nOn the Confederate side, forces in Mississippi were under the command of Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]], an officer from [[Pennsylvania]] who chose to fight for the [[Southern United States|South]]. Pemberton had approximately 12,000 men in Vicksburg and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]] had approximately 24,000 at Grenada.\n\nMeanwhile, political forces were at work. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] had long recognized the importance of Vicksburg; he wrote \"Vicksburg is the key. ...The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 24.</ref> Lincoln also envisioned a two-pronged offensive, but one up and down the river. Maj. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] politician, had convinced Lincoln that he could lead an army down the river and take Vicksburg. Lincoln approved his proposal and wanted Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to advance up river from New Orleans at the same time. McClernand began organizing regiments, sending them to Memphis. Back in [[Washington, D.C.]], Halleck was nervous about McClernand and gave Grant control of all troops in his own department. McClernand's troops were split into two corps, one under McClernand, the other under Sherman. McClernand complained but to no avail. Grant appropriated his troops, one of several maneuvers in a private dispute within the Union Army between Grant and McClernand that continued throughout the campaign.\n\n==Battles in the operations against Vicksburg, December 1862&nbsp;\u2013 January 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignDecember62March63.png|thumb|300px|Operations against Vicksburg and Grant's bayou operations {{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}} {{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nThe \"operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Chickasaw Bayou (December 26\u201329, 1862)===\n{{main article|Battle of Chickasaw Bayou}}\nSherman disembarked with three divisions at Johnson's Plantation on the Yazoo River to approach the Vicksburg defenses from the northeast. On December 27, the Federals pushed their lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended. On December 28, several futile attempts were made to get around these defenses. On December 29, Sherman ordered a frontal assault, which was repulsed with heavy casualties, and then withdrew.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms003.htm NPS Chickasaw Bayou.]</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the overland half of Grant's offensive was failing. His lines of communication were disrupted by raids by Van Dorn and [[Brigadier General#United States|Brig. Gen.]] [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], who destroyed his large supply depot at Holly Springs. Unable to subsist his army without these supplies, Grant abandoned his overland advance.\n\nIn early January, McClernand arrived at Memphis with the corps he had recruited (the [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]] under Brig. Gen. [[George W. Morgan]]) and commenced his operation down the Mississippi. On January 4, he ordered Sherman to attach his [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]] to the expedition, calling his combined 32,000-man force the [[Army of the Mississippi]]. This was a direct provocation against Grant, but Sherman acceded to the senior officer. Sherman suggested beginning with a combined land and naval movement against Fort Hindman, on the [[Arkansas River]] at [[Arkansas Post]], 50 miles up the Arkansas from its confluence with the Mississippi, a base from which Confederate gunboats were attacking Union shipping on the river. The expedition started without notifying Grant.<ref>Ballard, pp. 147\u201349.</ref>\n\n===Arkansas Post (January 9\u201311, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of  Arkansas land called pooh\nUnion boats under [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Adm.]] [[David Dixon Porter]] began landing troops near Arkansas Post in the evening of January 9. The troops started up river towards Fort Hindman. Sherman's corps overran Confederate trenches, and the defenders retreated to the protection of the fort and adjacent rifle-pits. Porter, on January 10, moved his fleet towards Fort Hindman and bombarded it, withdrawing at dusk. Union artillery fired on the fort from positions across the river on January 11, and the infantry moved into position for an attack. Union ironclads commenced shelling the fort and Porter's fleet passed it to cut off any retreat. As a result of this envelopment, and the attack by Morgan's troops, the Confederate command surrendered in the afternoon. Although Union losses were high and the victory did not contribute to the capture of Vicksburg, it did eliminate one more impediment to Union shipping on the Mississippi.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ar006.htm NPS Arkansas Post.]</ref>\n\nGrant was not happy to learn that McClernand had conducted the operation without his approval, considering it a distraction from his main objective of Vicksburg, but since it had been successful and his ally Sherman had suggested it, he took no punitive action. However, he ordered McClernand back to the Mississippi and assumed personal command of the campaign on January 13 at Milliken's Bend, 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg.\n\n==Grant's bayou operations, January\u2013March 1863==\nThat winter, Grant conducted a series of initiatives to approach and capture Vicksburg,<ref>''Organization of the Army of the Tennessee, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, U. S. Army, commanding, January 31, 1863'': Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIV, Part 3, [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar&cc=moawar&idno=waro0038&node=waro0038%3A1&view=image&seq=23&size=100 page 23.]</ref> termed \"Grant's bayou operations\". Their general theme was to use or construct alternative waterways so that troops could be positioned within striking distance of Vicksburg, without requiring a direct approach on the Mississippi under the Confederate guns.\n\n===Grant's Canal===\nThe Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula had been abandoned by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it had the potential to offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant\u2014who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea\u2014resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work \"Butler's Ditch\" (since it was Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam at the head of the canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, ''Hercules'' and ''Sampson'', attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 436\u201350; [http://www.nps.gov/archive/vick/grntcanl/grantsc.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\n===Lake Providence expedition===\nGrant ordered Brig. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]] to construct a canal of several hundred yards from the Mississippi to [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], northwest of the city. This would allow passage to the Red River, through Bayous Baxter and Macon, and the Tensas and Black Rivers. Reaching the Red River, Grant's force could join with Banks at Port Hudson. McPherson reported that the connection was navigable on March 18, but the few \"ordinary Ohio River boats\" that had been sent to Grant for navigation of the bayous could only transport 8,500 men, far too few to tip the balance at Port Hudson. Although this was the only one of the bayou expeditions to successfully bypass the Vicksburg defenses, historian [[Ed Bearss]] calls this episode the \"Lake Providence Boondoggle\".<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 467\u201378; Ballard, pp. 173\u201374.</ref>\n\n===Yazoo Pass expedition===\n{{main article|Yazoo Pass expedition}}\nThe next attempt was to get to the high ground of the [[loess]] bluffs above Hayne's Bluff and below Yazoo City by blowing up the Mississippi River levee near [[Moon Lake (Mississippi)|Moon Lake]], some 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) above Vicksburg, near [[Helena, Arkansas]], and following the Yazoo Pass (an old route from Yazoo City to Memphis, which was curtailed by the 1856 levee construction that sealed off the Pass from the Mississippi River to Moon Lake) into the Coldwater River, then to the [[Tallahatchie River]], and finally into the Yazoo River at [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. The dikes were blown up on February 3, beginning what was called the Yazoo Pass Expedition. Ten Union boats, under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Watson Smith, with army troops under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin Prentiss]], began moving through the pass on February 7. But low-hanging trees destroyed anything on the gunboats above deck and Confederates felled more trees to block the way. These delays allowed the Confederates time to quickly construct a \"Fort Pemberton\" near the confluence of the Tallahatchie and [[Yalobusha River]]s near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], which repulsed the naval force on March 11, March 14, and March 16. The Union effort collapsed in early April.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 479\u2013548; Ballard, pp. 174\u201384; Eicher, pp. 439\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Steele's Bayou expedition===\n{{main article|Steele's Bayou expedition}}\nAdmiral Porter started an effort on March 14 to go up the Yazoo Delta via Steele's Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, to [[Deer Creek (Mississippi)|Deer Creek]]. This would [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] Fort Pemberton and allow landing troops between Vicksburg and [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]]. Confederates once again felled trees in their path, and willow reeds fouled the boats' paddlewheels. This time the Union boats became immobilized, and Confederate cavalry and infantry threatened to capture them. Sherman sent infantry assistance to repel the Confederates bedeviling Porter, but Porter's approach was abandoned as too difficult.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 549\u201390; Ballard, pp. 184\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Duckport Canal===\nGrant's final attempt was to dig another canal from Duckport Landing to Walnut Bayou, aimed at getting lighter boats past Vicksburg. By the time the canal was almost finished, on April 6, water levels were declining, and none but the lightest of flatboats could get through. Grant abandoned this canal and started planning anew.<ref>Ballard, p. 193.</ref>\n\nFrom December through March, including Chickasaw Bayou and the Mississippi Central advance, seven initiatives, or \"experiments\", by Grant had failed. Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had undertaken these experiments primarily to keep his troops busy during the flooded and disease-laden winter months and that he had had no expectation of success. This claim is contradicted by correspondence from Grant at the time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Plan for the 1863 campaign and initial movements==\n[[File:View of Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|View of Vicksburg vicinity and fortifications, 1863]]\nAll of the bayou operations were failures, but Grant was known for his stubborn determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: March the army down the west side of the Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg's guns because the river current would slow them too much.\n\nOn March 29, McClernand set his troops to work building bridges and [[corduroy road]]s. They filled in the swamps in their way as well, and by April 17 they had a rough, tortuous 70-mile (110&nbsp;km) road from Milliken's Bend to the proposed river crossing at [[Hard Times, Louisiana]], below Vicksburg.\n\n[[File:Porter's flotilla below Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|left|Porter's flotilla arrives; General Sherman is going in a yawl to the flagship, {{USS|Benton|1861}}.]]\nOn April 16, a clear night with no moon, Porter sent seven gunboats and three empty troop transports loaded with stores to run the bluff, taking care to minimize noise and lights. But the preparations were ineffective. Confederate sentries sighted the boats, and the bluff exploded with massive artillery fire. Fires were set along the banks to improve visibility. The Union gunboats answered back. Porter observed that the Confederates mainly hit the high parts of his boats, reasoned that they could not depress their guns, and had them hug the east shore, right under Confederate cannon, so close he could hear their commanders giving orders, shells flying overhead. The fleet survived with little damage; thirteen men were wounded and none killed. The ''Henry Clay'' was disabled and burned at the water's edge. On April 22, six more boats loaded with supplies made the run; one boat did not make it, though no one was killed.  The crew floated downstream on the boat's remnants.\n\nThe final piece of Grant's strategy was to divert Pemberton's attention from the river crossing site that the Union troops would use. Grant chose two operations: a feint by Sherman against [[Snyder's Bluff, Mississippi]], north of Vicksburg (see the [[Battle of Snyder's Bluff]] below), and a daring cavalry raid through central Mississippi by [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Benjamin Grierson]], known as [[Grierson's Raid]]. The former was inconclusive, but the latter was a success. Grierson was able to draw out significant Confederate forces to chase him, and Pemberton's defenses were dispersed too far around the state. (Pemberton was also wary of Nathaniel Banks's impending advance up the river from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to threaten Port Hudson.){{citation needed|reason=whole section lacks sources|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|Champion Hill Union order of battle|Vicksburg Union order of battle|l2=Siege of Vicksburg Union order of battle}}\n\nMaj.

Sherman]]; the [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]]; a three-division detachment of the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Cadwallader C. Washburn]]; and a detachment from the District of Northeast Louisiana, under Brig. Gen. [[Elias S. Dennis]]. The [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John G.

Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Confederate '''[[Army of Mississippi]]''', approximately 30,000 men, consisted of five divisions, under Maj. Gens. [[William W. Loring]], [[Carter L.

Walker]].\n\n==Battles in Grant's operations against Vicksburg, April&nbsp;\u2013 July 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignAprilJuly63.png|thumb|350px|Grant's operations against Vicksburg]]\nThe \"Grant's operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Grand Gulf (April 29, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Grand Gulf}}\nAdmiral Porter led seven ironclads in an attack on the fortifications and batteries at [[Grand Gulf, Mississippi]], with the intention of silencing the Confederate guns and then securing the area with troops of McClernand's XIII Corps who were on the accompanying transports and barges. The attack by the seven ironclads began at 8 a.m. and continued until about 1:30&nbsp;p.m. During the fight, the ironclads moved within 100 yards of the Confederate guns and silenced the lower batteries of Fort Wade. The Confederate upper batteries at Fort Cobun remained out of reach and continued to fire. The Union ironclads (one of which, the [[USS Tuscumbia (1862)|''Tuscumbia'']], had been put out of action) and the transports drew off. After dark, however, the ironclads engaged the Confederate guns again while the steamboats and barges ran the gauntlet. Grant marched his men overland across Coffee Point to below the Gulf. After the transports had passed Grand Gulf, they embarked the troops at [[Disharoon's plantation]] and disembarked them on the Mississippi shore at Bruinsburg, below Grand Gulf. Grant landed 17,000 soldiers there, the largest amphibious operation in American military history until the [[Invasion of Normandy]]. The men immediately began marching overland towards [[Port Gibson, Mississippi]]. The Confederates had won a hollow victory, since the loss at Grand Gulf caused just a slight change in Grant's offensive.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bruinsburg Crossing (April 30 \u2013 May 1) | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/vick/historyculture/bruincross.htm | accessdate = 7 September 2018}}; [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms004.htm NPS Grand Gulf.]</ref>\n\n===Snyder's Bluff (April 29&nbsp;\u2013 May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Snyder's Bluff}}\nTo ensure that troops would not be withdrawn to Grand Gulf to assist Confederates there, a combined Union army-navy force feigned an attack on Snyder's Bluff. After noon on April 29, Lt. Cdr. [[Kidder Breese|K. Randolph Breese]], with his eight gunboats and ten transports carrying Maj. Gen. [[Francis Preston Blair, Jr.|Francis P. Blair]]'s division, inched up the Yazoo River to the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou where they spent the night. At 9 a.m., the next morning, the force, minus one gunboat, continued upriver to Drumgould's Bluff and engaged the enemy batteries. During the fighting, [[USS Choctaw (1856)|''Choctaw'']] suffered more than fifty hits, but no casualties occurred. Around 6 p.m., the troops disembarked and marched along Blake's Levee toward the guns. As they neared Drumgould's Bluff, a battery opened on them, creating havoc and casualties. The Union advance halted and, after dark, the men reembarked on the transports. The next morning, transports disembarked other troops. The swampy terrain and enemy heavy artillery fire forced them to retire. The gunboats opened fire again, about 3 p.m. on May 1, causing some damage. Later, the boats' fire slackened and stopped altogether after dark. Sherman had received orders to land his troops at Milliken's Bend, so the gunboats returned to their anchorages at the mouth of the Yazoo.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms005.htm NPS Snyder's Bluff.]</ref>\n\n===Port Gibson (May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Port Gibson}}\nGrant's army began marching inland from Bruinsburg. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson, they ran into Confederate outposts after midnight and skirmished with them for around three hours. After 3 a.m., the fighting stopped. Union forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30&nbsp;a.m., the Confederates engaged the Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals forced the Confederates to fall back. The Confederates established new defensive positions at different times during the day but they could not stop the Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated that the Confederates were unable to defend the Mississippi River line, and the Federals had secured their beachhead.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms006.htm NPS Port Gibson.]</ref>\n\nAt this point, Grant faced a decision. His original orders were to capture Grand Gulf and then proceed south to link up with Banks and reduce Port Hudson, after which their combined armies would return and capture Vicksburg. Unfortunately for Grant, such a course would put him under the command of the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.\n\nAfter the Union army seized the crossing at Grindstone Ford, any Confederate forces between the Big Bayou Pierre and the Big Black River were compromised. Realizing this, Bowen evacuated Grand Gulf and proceeded with all speed to Hankinson's Ford across the Big Black, barely escaping the Union trap. Grant's intention at this time was to move north over this same route and advance directly on Vicksburg. However, scouting parties that he sent out found that Pemberton had good defensive positions to the south of the city. Instead, he decided to break the city's supply line by seizing the railroad from Jackson to Vicksburg. He gave orders for his three corps (Sherman having arrived across the river) to advance over three separate routes to attack the railroad at [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards Station]] (the westernmost objective, with McClernand's corps), [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] (easternmost, with McPherson's) and Midway Station (center, with Sherman's).\n\n===Raymond (May 12)===\n{{main article|Battle of Raymond}}\nOn May 10, Pemberton ordered all reinforcements arriving at Jackson to march to [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) to the southwest. Brig. Gen. [[John Gregg (CSA)|John Gregg]]'s overstrength brigade, having endured a grueling march from [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], began marching to Raymond the next morning, arriving late in the afternoon of May 11. On May 12, Gregg's brigade moved to ambush a Union raiding party at Fourteen Mile Creek. The raiding party turned out to be Maj. Gen. [[John A. Logan]]'s Division of the XVII Corps. Gregg decided to dispute the crossing of Fourteen Mile Creek and arrayed his men and artillery accordingly. As Logan's men approached, the Confederates opened fire, initially causing heavy casualties. Some Union troops broke, but Logan rallied a force to hold the line. Confederate troops attacked the line but were forced to retire. Additional Union troops arrived and counterattacked. Heavy fighting ensued that continued for six hours, but the overwhelming Union force prevailed. Gregg's men left the field. Although they lost the battle, they had held up a much superior Union force for a day. General Gregg, under orders to withdraw to Jackson in the face of a superior force, withdrew five miles (8&nbsp;km) in the direction of Jackson to Mississippi Springs, Mississippi. This retrograde movement exposed the Southern Railroad of Mississippi to Union forces, thus severing the lifeline of Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms007.htm NPS Raymond.]</ref>\n\nDespite McPherson's victory, the presence of Confederate forces attacking Grant's right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] was due in Jackson with reinforcements within the next couple of days, and there was a rumor that Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] would also arrive on the scene. In this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank. Therefore, he chose to deal with the threat from the east first and ordered Sherman and McPherson to seize Jackson.\n\n===Jackson (May 14)===\n{{main article|Battle of Jackson, Mississippi}}\nOn May 9, Gen. Johnston received a dispatch from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to \"proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field\". When he arrived in Jackson on May 13 from [[Middle Tennessee]], he learned that two army corps\u2014Sherman's and McPherson's\u2014were advancing on Jackson and that Gregg had only about 6,000 troops available to defend the city. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10 a.m., both Union army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11 a.m., when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Union troops entered Jackson and had a celebration hosted by Grant, who had been traveling with Sherman's corps, in the Bowman House. They then burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg. Johnston's evacuation is seen as a mistake because he could, by late on May 14, have had 11,000 troops at his disposal and by the morning of May 15, another 4,000. The fall of the Mississippi state capital was a blow to Confederate morale.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ms008.htm NPS Jackson.]</ref>  Having broken the rail links, Grant temporarily abandoned the city to allow his troops to concentrate on Vicksburg.\n\nJohnston retreated with most of his army up the Canton Road, but he ordered Pemberton to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton and his generals felt that Johnston's plan was dangerous and decided instead to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On May 16, however, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch, his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the vanguard of his force.\n\n===Champion Hill (May 16)===\n{{main article|Battle of Champion Hill}}\nOn May 16, about 7 a.m., the Union forces engaged the Confederates and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton's force drew up into a defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen. [[Stephen D. Lee]]'s men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the Confederates off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant arrived at Champion Hill, around 10 a.m., he ordered the attack to begin. By 11:30&nbsp;a.m., Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about 1 p.m., they took the crest while the Confederates retreated in disorder. The Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (Bowen's) then counterattacked, pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton's men could not stand up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]]'s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs, including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates were in full retreat towards Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms009.htm NPS Champion Hill.]</ref>\n\n===Big Black River Bridge (May 17)===\n{{main article|Battle of Big Black River Bridge}}\nThe Confederate retreat reached [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]] Bridge the night of May 16\u201317. Pemberton ordered Brig. Gen. Bowen, with three brigades, to man the fortifications on the east bank of the river and impede any Union pursuit. Three divisions of McClernand's corps moved out from Edwards Station on the morning of May 17. The corps encountered the Confederates behind breastworks and took cover as enemy artillery began firing. Union Brig. Gen. [[Michael K. Lawler]] formed his 2nd Brigade, Brig. Gen. [[Eugene Asa Carr|Eugene A. Carr]]'s Division, which surged out of a river meander scar, across the front of the Confederate forces, and into the enemy's breastworks, held by Brig. Gen. [[John C. Vaughn]]'s inexperienced East Tennessee Brigade. Confused and panicked, the Confederates began to withdraw across the Big Black on two bridges: the railroad bridge and the steamboat dock moored athwart the river. As soon as they had crossed, the Confederates set fire to the bridges, preventing close Union pursuit. The fleeing Confederates who arrived in Vicksburg later that day were disorganized. The Union forces captured approximately 1,800 troops at Big Black, a loss that the Confederates could ill afford.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms010.htm NPS Big Black River Bridge.]</ref>\n\n===Siege of Vicksburg (May 18&nbsp;\u2013 July 4)===\n{{main article|Siege of Vicksburg}}\n[[File:VicksburgSiege.png|thumb|300px|Siege of Vicksburg. Corps and division commanders are shown for the period June 23&nbsp;\u2013 July 4.]]\nThe Union army converged on Vicksburg, trapping Pemberton's force. Grant attempted two assaults to break through the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand's sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to arrange it in time. Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms011.htm NPS Vicksburg.]</ref>\n\nIn addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had to be concerned with Confederate forces in his rear. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as [[Mechanicsburg, Mississippi|Mechanicsburg]], both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[John G. Parke]], was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]], from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. [[Frederick Steele]] replaced him at the XV Corps on June 22. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson.<ref>Esposito, text for map 107.</ref>\n\n==Louisiana operations==\nDuring the Siege of Vicksburg, three other battles took place in the vicinity:\n\n===Milliken's Bend (June 7)===\n{{further|Battle of Milliken's Bend}}\nIn an effort to cut Grant's supply line during the siege, the Confederates attacked the Milliken's Bend supply area up the Mississippi. This was mainly defended by untrained [[African-American|black]] troops, who fought bravely with inferior weaponry and finally fought off the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at significant cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battles-detail.htm?battleCode=la011 NPS Milliken's Bend.]</ref>\n\n===Goodrich's Landing (June 29\u201330)===\n{{further|Battle of Goodrich's Landing}}\nAfter Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore, leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses for food, clothing, etc. African-American troops were assigned to protect these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an expedition from [[Gaines's Landing, Arkansas]], to Lake Providence. Although the Confederates disrupted these operations, destroyed much property, and captured many supplies and weapons, the raid was only a minor setback for the Union. The Confederates could cause momentary disturbances, but they were unable to effect any lasting changes.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/la014.htm NPS Goodrich's Landing.]</ref>\n\n===Helena (July 4)===\n{{further|Battle of Helena}}\nConfederate Lt. Gen. [[Theophilus H. Holmes]]'s troops attacked [[Helena, Arkansas]], in an attempt to relieve pressure on Vicksburg. Although the Confederates had more troops and did initially capture some of the fortifications, the Union forces repelled them.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ar008.htm NPS Helena.]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough the Confederate killed and wounded in the battle and siege of Vicksburg were a relatively small 2,872, and Union 4,910, Grant captured his second Confederate army in its entirety (the first being at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]]): 29,495 surrendered.<ref>Kennedy, p. 173.</ref> Most of the Confederates were paroled. The Union also captured significant quantities of artillery, small arms, and ammunition. The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded.<ref>Ballard, pp. 398\u201399.</ref>\n\nThis was the second major blow to the Confederacy in the summer of 1863. On July 3, Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of the North collapsed at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. On July 4, the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] rose over Vicksburg. To the Confederates, surrendering on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] was a bitter defeat. Union troops behaved well, mixing with Confederates and giving rations to starving soldiers. Speculators who had been hoarding food for higher prices saw their stores broken open and the contents thrown on the streets for the starving rebels. In his ''Personal Memoirs'', Grant observed, \"The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause.\"<ref>Grant, chapter XXXVIII, p. 38.</ref> But resentments lingered: allegedly tradition holds that the [[Fourth of July]] holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This claim has been challenged because large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldrep|first=Christopher|title=Vicksburg's Long Shadow: The Civil War Legacy Of Race And Remembrance |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0742548688 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDgeo7QYJEC&pg=PA247 |page=247}}</ref><ref>Historian Michael G. Ballard, in his ''Vicksburg'' campaign history, pp. 420-21, claims that this story has little foundation in fact. Although it is unknown whether city officials sanctioned the day as a local holiday, Southern observances of July 4 were for many years characterized more by family picnics than by formal city or county activities.</ref>\nThe most significant result of the campaign was control of the Mississippi River, which the Union obtained completely after [[Battle of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]], which had been besieged by Banks since May 27, heard news of Vicksburg's fall and surrendered on July 9. The Confederacy was now cut in two; one week later, an unarmed ship arrived in Union-held New Orleans from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after an uneventful trip down the river. President Lincoln announced, \"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 410.</ref>\n\nGrant deployed Sherman and 50,000 troops against Johnston's 31,000 in Jackson. Johnston tried to lure Sherman into a frontal assault, but Sherman had seen the results of such at Vicksburg. He demurred and began surrounding the city. Johnston escaped with his army, which was more than Pemberton had achieved, but all of central Mississippi was now under Sherman's control. He used a subsequent operation against [[Meridian, Mississippi]], as a harbinger of the [[scorched earth]] tactics he later employed in his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and then [[Carolinas campaign|South Carolina]].\n\nOne of Grant's actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]]. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. McClernand's XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord]]. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote [[Texas]].<ref>Bearss, vol. III, pp. 875\u201379; Ballard, pp. 358\u201359; Korn, pp. 147\u201348.</ref>\n\nGrant was the undisputed victor of the Vicksburg campaign. He was rewarded for his victory with a promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], effective on July 4, 1863. He also received an unusual letter:\n\n{{Quote|My dear General\n\nI do not remember that you and I ever met personally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country. I wish to say a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do, what you finally did\u2014march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed. When you got below, and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join Gen. Banks; and when you turned Northward East of the Big Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right, and I was wrong.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Lincoln<ref>Smith, p. 257.</ref>}}\n\nGrant went on to rescue Union forces besieged at [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] and then replaced Halleck as general in chief of all Union armies, with the recently re-activated rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]]. Despite his ultimate success in winning the war, historians have often considered Vicksburg his finest campaign\u2014imaginative, audacious, relentless, and a masterpiece of maneuver warfare. [[James M. McPherson]] called Vicksburg \"the most brilliant and innovative campaign of the Civil War\"; [[T. Harry Williams]] described it as \"one of the classic campaigns of the Civil War and, indeed, of military history\"; and the U.S. Army ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual&nbsp;100\u20135]]'' (May&nbsp;1986) called it \"the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil\".<ref>Bonekemper, ''A Victor, Not a Butcher'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Steven E. Woodworth]] wrote that Pemberton \"had a strong claim to the title of the most hated man in the South, certainly the most hated to wear a Confederate uniform\". There were accusations that adequate supplies had been on hand and that it was only his treachery that caused the surrender. Even his friend, Confederate general [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], wrote after the war that a large part of the population believed \"He had joined the South for the express purpose of betraying it, and this was clearly proven by the fact that he surrendered on the 4th of July, a day sacred to the Yankees.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 218.</ref><ref>David Zimring, ''To live and Die in Dixie: Native Northerners Who Fought for the Confederacy'', Univ Tennessee Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1621901068}}; p. 262.</ref>\n\nThe blame for losing Vicksburg fell not only on John Pemberton, but on the overcautious Joseph E. Johnston. Jefferson Davis said of the defeat, \"Yes, from a want of provisions inside and a General outside who wouldn't fight.\"<ref>McPherson, p. 637.</ref> Anguished soldiers and civilians starving in the siege held hopes that he would come to their aid, but he never did. Accusations of cowardice that had dogged him since the 1862 [[Peninsula Campaign]] continued to follow him in the 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign]] against Sherman. However, Johnston was far outnumbered. While he was one of few Confederate generals whom Grant respected, he was outgeneraled.\n\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:Grant Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The monument to U.S. Grant at the national military park in Vicksburg, MS, unveiled in 1919]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1863]]\n* [[List of costliest American Civil War land battles]]\n* [[Armies in the American Civil War]]\n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War]] \n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps]]\n* [[Vicksburg National Military Park]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Ballard, Michael B.

The [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Tennessee]] under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the river by capturing this stronghold and defeating [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[John C. Pemberton]]'s forces stationed there.\n\nThe campaign consisted of many important naval operations, troop maneuvers, failed initiatives, and eleven distinct battles from December 26, 1862, to July 4, 1863. Military historians divide the campaign into two formal phases: '''operations against Vicksburg''' (December&nbsp;1862&nbsp;\u2013 January&nbsp;1863) and '''Grant's operations against Vicksburg''' (March\u2013July 1863).\n\nGrant initially planned a two-pronged approach in which half of his army, under Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], would advance to the [[Yazoo River]] and attempt to reach Vicksburg from the northeast, while Grant took the remainder of the army down the Mississippi Central Railroad. Both of these initiatives failed. Grant conducted a number of \"experiments\" or expeditions\u2014Grant's bayou operations\u2014that attempted to enable waterborne access to the Mississippi south of Vicksburg's artillery batteries. All five of these initiatives failed as well. Finally, Union gunboats and troop transport boats ran the batteries at Vicksburg and met up with Grant's men who had marched overland in [[Louisiana]]. On April 29 and April 30, 1863, Grant's army crossed the Mississippi and landed at [[Bruinsburg, Mississippi]]. An elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions fooled the Confederates and the landings occurred without opposition. Over the next 17 days, Grant maneuvered his army inland and won five battles, captured the state capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and assaulted and laid siege to Vicksburg.\n\nAfter Pemberton's army surrendered on July 4 (one day after the Confederate defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]), and when [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] surrendered to Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] on July 9, Texas and Arkansas were effectively cut off from the Confederacy, and the Mississippi River was once again open for northern commerce to reach the Gulf of Mexico, and as a supply line for the Union Army. Grant's Vicksburg campaign is studied as a masterpiece of military operations and a major [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Military situation===\n{{Main article|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}{{further|American Civil War}}\n{| align=right\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Army commanders (Vicksburg campaign)\n|-\n|<gallery>\nImage:GenUSGrant.jpg|<center>Maj.

Pemberton]], CSA</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nVicksburg was strategically vital to the Confederates. [[Jefferson Davis]] said, \"Vicksburg is the nail head that holds the South's two halves together.\"<ref>Winschel, p. 14.</ref> While in their hands, it blocked Union navigation down the Mississippi; together with control of the mouth of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] to the south, it allowed communication with the states west of the river, upon which the Confederates depended extensively for horses, cattle and reinforcements. The natural defenses of the city were ideal, earning it the nickname \"The Gibraltar of the Confederacy\". It was located on a high bluff overlooking a horseshoe-shaped bend in the river, De Soto Peninsula, making it almost impossible to approach by ship. North and East of Vicksburg was the [[Mississippi Delta]] (sometimes known as the Yazoo Delta), an area 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) north to south and up to 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) across, which has been described by geographer Warren E. Grabau as an \"astonishingly complex network of intersecting waterways\", some of which were navigable by small steamboats. The regions between modern rivers and bayous formed closed basins called backswamps, of which Grabau judged, \"Whether permanently flooded or not, the backswamps were, for all practical purposes, untamed wildernesses, utterly impassable by a man on horseback or by any form of wheeled vehicle, and very difficult even for a man on foot.\"<ref>Grabau, p. 19.</ref> About twelve miles (19&nbsp;km) up the [[Yazoo River]] were Confederate batteries and entrenchments at Haynes Bluff. The [[Louisiana]] land west of Vicksburg was also difficult, with many streams and poor country roads, widespread winter flooding, and it was on the opposite side of the river from the fortress.\n\nThe city had been under Union naval attack before. Admiral [[David Farragut]] moved up the river after his [[capture of New Orleans]] and on May 18, 1862, demanded the surrender of Vicksburg. Farragut had insufficient troops to force the issue, and he moved back to New Orleans. He returned with a flotilla in June 1862, but their attempts (June 26\u201328) to bombard the fortress into surrender failed. They shelled Vicksburg throughout July and fought some minor battles with a few Confederate vessels in the area, but their forces were insufficient to attempt a landing, and they abandoned attempts to force the surrender of the city. Farragut investigated the possibility of bypassing the fortified cliffs by digging a canal across the neck of the river's bend, the De Soto Peninsula. On June 28, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Thomas Williams (general)|Thomas Williams]], attached to Farragut's command, began digging work on the canal by employing local laborers and some soldiers. Many of the men fell victim to tropical diseases and heat exhaustion, and the work was abandoned by July 24. (Williams was killed two weeks later in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Battle of Baton Rouge]]).<ref>Ballard, pp. 46\u201362; Bearss, vol. I, p. 437; [https://www.nps.gov/vick/learn/historyculture/grants-canal.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]] was promoted from command of the Western Theater to General-in-Chief of all Union armies. On November 23, he indicated to Grant his preference for a major move down the Mississippi to Vicksburg; in Halleck's style, he left considerable initiative to design a campaign, an opportunity that the pugnacious Grant seized. Halleck has received criticism for not moving promptly overland from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to seize Vicksburg during the summer when he was in command on the scene. He believed that the Navy could capture the fortress on its own, not knowing that the naval force was insufficiently manned with ground troops to finish the job. What might have achieved success in the summer of 1862 was no longer possible by November because the Confederates had amply reinforced the garrison by that time.  Also reliable navigation on the river was seasonal, and the natural fall in the level of the river during the fall and winter months limited the utility of shipping, the usable draft of riverboats, and the quantity of men, supplies, and equipment, they could transport.\n\nGrant's army marched south down the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]], making a forward base at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. He planned a two-pronged assault in the direction of Vicksburg. His principal subordinate, Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was to advance down the river with four divisions (about 32,000 men) and Grant would continue with the remaining forces (about 40,000) down the railroad line to [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he would wait for developments, hoping to lure the Confederate army out of the city to attack him in the vicinity of [[Grenada, Mississippi]].\n\nOn the Confederate side, forces in Mississippi were under the command of Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]], an officer from [[Pennsylvania]] who chose to fight for the [[Southern United States|South]]. Pemberton had approximately 12,000 men in Vicksburg and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]] had approximately 24,000 at Grenada.\n\nMeanwhile, political forces were at work. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] had long recognized the importance of Vicksburg; he wrote \"Vicksburg is the key. ...The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 24.</ref> Lincoln also envisioned a two-pronged offensive, but one up and down the river. Maj. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] politician, had convinced Lincoln that he could lead an army down the river and take Vicksburg. Lincoln approved his proposal and wanted Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to advance up river from New Orleans at the same time. McClernand began organizing regiments, sending them to Memphis. Back in [[Washington, D.C.]], Halleck was nervous about McClernand and gave Grant control of all troops in his own department. McClernand's troops were split into two corps, one under McClernand, the other under Sherman. McClernand complained but to no avail. Grant appropriated his troops, one of several maneuvers in a private dispute within the Union Army between Grant and McClernand that continued throughout the campaign.\n\n==Battles in the operations against Vicksburg, December 1862&nbsp;\u2013 January 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignDecember62March63.png|thumb|300px|Operations against Vicksburg and Grant's bayou operations {{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}} {{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nThe \"operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Chickasaw Bayou (December 26\u201329, 1862)===\n{{main article|Battle of Chickasaw Bayou}}\nSherman disembarked with three divisions at Johnson's Plantation on the Yazoo River to approach the Vicksburg defenses from the northeast. On December 27, the Federals pushed their lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended. On December 28, several futile attempts were made to get around these defenses. On December 29, Sherman ordered a frontal assault, which was repulsed with heavy casualties, and then withdrew.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms003.htm NPS Chickasaw Bayou.]</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the overland half of Grant's offensive was failing. His lines of communication were disrupted by raids by Van Dorn and [[Brigadier General#United States|Brig. Gen.]] [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], who destroyed his large supply depot at Holly Springs. Unable to subsist his army without these supplies, Grant abandoned his overland advance.\n\nIn early January, McClernand arrived at Memphis with the corps he had recruited (the [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]] under Brig. Gen. [[George W. Morgan]]) and commenced his operation down the Mississippi. On January 4, he ordered Sherman to attach his [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]] to the expedition, calling his combined 32,000-man force the [[Army of the Mississippi]]. This was a direct provocation against Grant, but Sherman acceded to the senior officer. Sherman suggested beginning with a combined land and naval movement against Fort Hindman, on the [[Arkansas River]] at [[Arkansas Post]], 50 miles up the Arkansas from its confluence with the Mississippi, a base from which Confederate gunboats were attacking Union shipping on the river. The expedition started without notifying Grant.<ref>Ballard, pp. 147\u201349.</ref>\n\n===Arkansas Post (January 9\u201311, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Arkansas Post}}\nUnion boats under [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Adm.]] [[David Dixon Porter]] began landing troops near Arkansas Post in the evening of January 9. The troops started up river towards Fort Hindman. Sherman's corps overran Confederate trenches, and the defenders retreated to the protection of the fort and adjacent rifle-pits. Porter, on January 10, moved his fleet towards Fort Hindman and bombarded it, withdrawing at dusk. Union artillery fired on the fort from positions across the river on January 11, and the infantry moved into position for an attack. Union ironclads commenced shelling the fort and Porter's fleet passed it to cut off any retreat. As a result of this envelopment, and the attack by Morgan's troops, the Confederate command surrendered in the afternoon. Although Union losses were high and the victory did not contribute to the capture of Vicksburg, it did eliminate one more impediment to Union shipping on the Mississippi.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ar006.htm NPS Arkansas Post.]</ref>\n\nGrant was not happy to learn that McClernand had conducted the operation without his approval, considering it a distraction from his main objective of Vicksburg, but since it had been successful and his ally Sherman had suggested it, he took no punitive action. However, he ordered McClernand back to the Mississippi and assumed personal command of the campaign on January 13 at Milliken's Bend, 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg.\n\n==Grant's bayou operations, January\u2013March 1863==\nThat winter, Grant conducted a series of initiatives to approach and capture Vicksburg,<ref>''Organization of the Army of the Tennessee, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, U. S. Army, commanding, January 31, 1863'': Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIV, Part 3, [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar&cc=moawar&idno=waro0038&node=waro0038%3A1&view=image&seq=23&size=100 page 23.]</ref> termed \"Grant's bayou operations\". Their general theme was to use or construct alternative waterways so that troops could be positioned within striking distance of Vicksburg, without requiring a direct approach on the Mississippi under the Confederate guns.\n\n===Grant's Canal===\nThe Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula had been abandoned by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it had the potential to offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant\u2014who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea\u2014resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work \"Butler's Ditch\" (since it was Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam at the head of the canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, ''Hercules'' and ''Sampson'', attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 436\u201350; [http://www.nps.gov/archive/vick/grntcanl/grantsc.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\n===Lake Providence expedition===\nGrant ordered Brig. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]] to construct a canal of several hundred yards from the Mississippi to [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], northwest of the city. This would allow passage to the Red River, through Bayous Baxter and Macon, and the Tensas and Black Rivers. Reaching the Red River, Grant's force could join with Banks at Port Hudson. McPherson reported that the connection was navigable on March 18, but the few \"ordinary Ohio River boats\" that had been sent to Grant for navigation of the bayous could only transport 8,500 men, far too few to tip the balance at Port Hudson. Although this was the only one of the bayou expeditions to successfully bypass the Vicksburg defenses, historian [[Ed Bearss]] calls this episode the \"Lake Providence Boondoggle\".<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 467\u201378; Ballard, pp. 173\u201374.</ref>\n\n===Yazoo Pass expedition===\n{{main article|Yazoo Pass expedition}}\nThe next attempt was to get to the high ground of the [[loess]] bluffs above Hayne's Bluff and below Yazoo City by blowing up the Mississippi River levee near [[Moon Lake (Mississippi)|Moon Lake]], some 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) above Vicksburg, near [[Helena, Arkansas]], and following the Yazoo Pass (an old route from Yazoo City to Memphis, which was curtailed by the 1856 levee construction that sealed off the Pass from the Mississippi River to Moon Lake) into the Coldwater River, then to the [[Tallahatchie River]], and finally into the Yazoo River at [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. The dikes were blown up on February 3, beginning what was called the Yazoo Pass Expedition. Ten Union boats, under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Watson Smith, with army troops under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin Prentiss]], began moving through the pass on February 7. But low-hanging trees destroyed anything on the gunboats above deck and Confederates felled more trees to block the way. These delays allowed the Confederates time to quickly construct a \"Fort Pemberton\" near the confluence of the Tallahatchie and [[Yalobusha River]]s near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], which repulsed the naval force on March 11, March 14, and March 16. The Union effort collapsed in early April.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 479\u2013548; Ballard, pp. 174\u201384; Eicher, pp. 439\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Steele's Bayou expedition===\n{{main article|Steele's Bayou expedition}}\nAdmiral Porter started an effort on March 14 to go up the Yazoo Delta via Steele's Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, to [[Deer Creek (Mississippi)|Deer Creek]]. This would [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] Fort Pemberton and allow landing troops between Vicksburg and [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]]. Confederates once again felled trees in their path, and willow reeds fouled the boats' paddlewheels. This time the Union boats became immobilized, and Confederate cavalry and infantry threatened to capture them. Sherman sent infantry assistance to repel the Confederates bedeviling Porter, but Porter's approach was abandoned as too difficult.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 549\u201390; Ballard, pp. 184\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Duckport Canal===\nGrant's final attempt was to dig another canal from Duckport Landing to Walnut Bayou, aimed at getting lighter boats past Vicksburg. By the time the canal was almost finished, on April 6, water levels were declining, and none but the lightest of flatboats could get through. Grant abandoned this canal and started planning anew.<ref>Ballard, p. 193.</ref>\n\nFrom December through March, including Chickasaw Bayou and the Mississippi Central advance, seven initiatives, or \"experiments\", by Grant had failed. Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had undertaken these experiments primarily to keep his troops busy during the flooded and disease-laden winter months and that he had had no expectation of success. This claim is contradicted by correspondence from Grant at the time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Plan for the 1863 campaign and initial movements==\n[[File:View of Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|View of Vicksburg vicinity and fortifications, 1863]]\nAll of the bayou operations were failures, but Grant was known for his stubborn determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: March the army down the west side of the Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg's guns because the river current would slow them too much.\n\nOn March 29, McClernand set his troops to work building bridges and [[corduroy road]]s. They filled in the swamps in their way as well, and by April 17 they had a rough, tortuous 70-mile (110&nbsp;km) road from Milliken's Bend to the proposed river crossing at [[Hard Times, Louisiana]], below Vicksburg.\n\n[[File:Porter's flotilla below Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|left|Porter's flotilla arrives; General Sherman is going in a yawl to the flagship, {{USS|Benton|1861}}.]]\nOn April 16, a clear night with no moon, Porter sent seven gunboats and three empty troop transports loaded with stores to run the bluff, taking care to minimize noise and lights. But the preparations were ineffective. Confederate sentries sighted the boats, and the bluff exploded with massive artillery fire. Fires were set along the banks to improve visibility. The Union gunboats answered back. Porter observed that the Confederates mainly hit the high parts of his boats, reasoned that they could not depress their guns, and had them hug the east shore, right under Confederate cannon, so close he could hear their commanders giving orders, shells flying overhead. The fleet survived with little damage; thirteen men were wounded and none killed. The ''Henry Clay'' was disabled and burned at the water's edge. On April 22, six more boats loaded with supplies made the run; one boat did not make it, though no one was killed.  The crew floated downstream on the boat's remnants.\n\nThe final piece of Grant's strategy was to divert Pemberton's attention from the river crossing site that the Union troops would use. Grant chose two operations: a feint by Sherman against [[Snyder's Bluff, Mississippi]], north of Vicksburg (see the [[Battle of Snyder's Bluff]] below), and a daring cavalry raid through central Mississippi by [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Benjamin Grierson]], known as [[Grierson's Raid]]. The former was inconclusive, but the latter was a success. Grierson was able to draw out significant Confederate forces to chase him, and Pemberton's defenses were dispersed too far around the state. (Pemberton was also wary of Nathaniel Banks's impending advance up the river from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to threaten Port Hudson.){{citation needed|reason=whole section lacks sources|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|Champion Hill Union order of battle|Vicksburg Union order of battle|l2=Siege of Vicksburg Union order of battle}}\n\nMaj.

Sherman]]; the [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]]; a three-division detachment of the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Cadwallader C. Washburn]]; and a detachment from the District of Northeast Louisiana, under Brig. Gen. [[Elias S. Dennis]]. The [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John G.

Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]]'s Confederate '''[[Army of Mississippi]]''', approximately 30,000 men, consisted of five divisions, under Maj. Gens. [[William W. Loring]], [[Carter L.

Walker]].\n\n==Battles in Grant's operations against Vicksburg, April&nbsp;\u2013 July 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignAprilJuly63.png|thumb|350px|Grant's operations against Vicksburg]]\nThe \"Grant's operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Grand Gulf (April 29, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Grand Gulf}}\nAdmiral Porter led seven ironclads in an attack on the fortifications and batteries at [[Grand Gulf, Mississippi]], with the intention of silencing the Confederate guns and then securing the area with troops of McClernand's XIII Corps who were on the accompanying transports and barges. The attack by the seven ironclads began at 8 a.m. and continued until about 1:30&nbsp;p.m. During the fight, the ironclads moved within 100 yards of the Confederate guns and silenced the lower batteries of Fort Wade. The Confederate upper batteries at Fort Cobun remained out of reach and continued to fire. The Union ironclads (one of which, the [[USS Tuscumbia (1862)|''Tuscumbia'']], had been put out of action) and the transports drew off. After dark, however, the ironclads engaged the Confederate guns again while the steamboats and barges ran the gauntlet. Grant marched his men overland across Coffee Point to below the Gulf. After the transports had passed Grand Gulf, they embarked the troops at [[Disharoon's plantation]] and disembarked them on the Mississippi shore at Bruinsburg, below Grand Gulf. Grant landed 17,000 soldiers there, the largest amphibious operation in American military history until the [[Invasion of Normandy]]. The men immediately began marching overland towards [[Port Gibson, Mississippi]]. The Confederates had won a hollow victory, since the loss at Grand Gulf caused just a slight change in Grant's offensive.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bruinsburg Crossing (April 30 \u2013 May 1) | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/vick/historyculture/bruincross.htm | accessdate = 7 September 2018}}; [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms004.htm NPS Grand Gulf.]</ref>\n\n===Snyder's Bluff (April 29&nbsp;\u2013 May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Snyder's Bluff}}\nTo ensure that troops would not be withdrawn to Grand Gulf to assist Confederates there, a combined Union army-navy force feigned an attack on Snyder's Bluff. After noon on April 29, Lt. Cdr. [[Kidder Breese|K. Randolph Breese]], with his eight gunboats and ten transports carrying Maj. Gen. [[Francis Preston Blair, Jr.|Francis P. Blair]]'s division, inched up the Yazoo River to the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou where they spent the night. At 9 a.m., the next morning, the force, minus one gunboat, continued upriver to Drumgould's Bluff and engaged the enemy batteries. During the fighting, [[USS Choctaw (1856)|''Choctaw'']] suffered more than fifty hits, but no casualties occurred. Around 6 p.m., the troops disembarked and marched along Blake's Levee toward the guns. As they neared Drumgould's Bluff, a battery opened on them, creating havoc and casualties. The Union advance halted and, after dark, the men reembarked on the transports. The next morning, transports disembarked other troops. The swampy terrain and enemy heavy artillery fire forced them to retire. The gunboats opened fire again, about 3 p.m. on May 1, causing some damage. Later, the boats' fire slackened and stopped altogether after dark. Sherman had received orders to land his troops at Milliken's Bend, so the gunboats returned to their anchorages at the mouth of the Yazoo.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms005.htm NPS Snyder's Bluff.]</ref>\n\n===Port Gibson (May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Port Gibson}}\nGrant's army began marching inland from Bruinsburg. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson, they ran into Confederate outposts after midnight and skirmished with them for around three hours. After 3 a.m., the fighting stopped. Union forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30&nbsp;a.m., the Confederates engaged the Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals forced the Confederates to fall back. The Confederates established new defensive positions at different times during the day but they could not stop the Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated that the Confederates were unable to defend the Mississippi River line, and the Federals had secured their beachhead.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms006.htm NPS Port Gibson.]</ref>\n\nAt this point, Grant faced a decision. His original orders were to capture Grand Gulf and then proceed south to link up with Banks and reduce Port Hudson, after which their combined armies would return and capture Vicksburg. Unfortunately for Grant, such a course would put him under the command of the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.\n\nAfter the Union army seized the crossing at Grindstone Ford, any Confederate forces between the Big Bayou Pierre and the Big Black River were compromised. Realizing this, Bowen evacuated Grand Gulf and proceeded with all speed to Hankinson's Ford across the Big Black, barely escaping the Union trap. Grant's intention at this time was to move north over this same route and advance directly on Vicksburg. However, scouting parties that he sent out found that Pemberton had good defensive positions to the south of the city. Instead, he decided to break the city's supply line by seizing the railroad from Jackson to Vicksburg. He gave orders for his three corps (Sherman having arrived across the river) to advance over three separate routes to attack the railroad at [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards Station]] (the westernmost objective, with McClernand's corps), [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] (easternmost, with McPherson's) and Midway Station (center, with Sherman's).\n\n===Raymond (May 12)===\n{{main article|Battle of Raymond}}\nOn May 10, Pemberton ordered all reinforcements arriving at Jackson to march to [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) to the southwest. Brig. Gen. [[John Gregg (CSA)|John Gregg]]'s overstrength brigade, having endured a grueling march from [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], began marching to Raymond the next morning, arriving late in the afternoon of May 11. On May 12, Gregg's brigade moved to ambush a Union raiding party at Fourteen Mile Creek. The raiding party turned out to be Maj. Gen. [[John A. Logan]]'s Division of the XVII Corps. Gregg decided to dispute the crossing of Fourteen Mile Creek and arrayed his men and artillery accordingly. As Logan's men approached, the Confederates opened fire, initially causing heavy casualties. Some Union troops broke, but Logan rallied a force to hold the line. Confederate troops attacked the line but were forced to retire. Additional Union troops arrived and counterattacked. Heavy fighting ensued that continued for six hours, but the overwhelming Union force prevailed. Gregg's men left the field. Although they lost the battle, they had held up a much superior Union force for a day. General Gregg, under orders to withdraw to Jackson in the face of a superior force, withdrew five miles (8&nbsp;km) in the direction of Jackson to Mississippi Springs, Mississippi. This retrograde movement exposed the Southern Railroad of Mississippi to Union forces, thus severing the lifeline of Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms007.htm NPS Raymond.]</ref>\n\nDespite McPherson's victory, the presence of Confederate forces attacking Grant's right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] was due in Jackson with reinforcements within the next couple of days, and there was a rumor that Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] would also arrive on the scene. In this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank. Therefore, he chose to deal with the threat from the east first and ordered Sherman and McPherson to seize Jackson.\n\n===Jackson (May 14)===\n{{main article|Battle of Jackson, Mississippi}}\nOn May 9, Gen. Johnston received a dispatch from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to \"proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field\". When he arrived in Jackson on May 13 from [[Middle Tennessee]], he learned that two army corps\u2014Sherman's and McPherson's\u2014were advancing on Jackson and that Gregg had only about 6,000 troops available to defend the city. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10 a.m., both Union army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11 a.m., when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Union troops entered Jackson and had a celebration hosted by Grant, who had been traveling with Sherman's corps, in the Bowman House. They then burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg. Johnston's evacuation is seen as a mistake because he could, by late on May 14, have had 11,000 troops at his disposal and by the morning of May 15, another 4,000. The fall of the Mississippi state capital was a blow to Confederate morale.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ms008.htm NPS Jackson.]</ref>  Having broken the rail links, Grant temporarily abandoned the city to allow his troops to concentrate on Vicksburg.\n\nJohnston retreated with most of his army up the Canton Road, but he ordered Pemberton to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton and his generals felt that Johnston's plan was dangerous and decided instead to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On May 16, however, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch, his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the vanguard of his force.\n\n===Champion Hill (May 16)===\n{{main article|Battle of Champion Hill}}\nOn May 16, about 7 a.m., the Union forces engaged the Confederates and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton's force drew up into a defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen. [[Stephen D. Lee]]'s men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the Confederates off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant arrived at Champion Hill, around 10 a.m., he ordered the attack to begin. By 11:30&nbsp;a.m., Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about 1 p.m., they took the crest while the Confederates retreated in disorder. The Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (Bowen's) then counterattacked, pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton's men could not stand up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]]'s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs, including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates were in full retreat towards Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms009.htm NPS Champion Hill.]</ref>\n\n===Big Black River Bridge (May 17)===\n{{main article|Battle of Big Black River Bridge}}\nThe Confederate retreat reached [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]] Bridge the night of May 16\u201317. Pemberton ordered Brig. Gen. Bowen, with three brigades, to man the fortifications on the east bank of the river and impede any Union pursuit. Three divisions of McClernand's corps moved out from Edwards Station on the morning of May 17. The corps encountered the Confederates behind breastworks and took cover as enemy artillery began firing. Union Brig. Gen. [[Michael K. Lawler]] formed his 2nd Brigade, Brig. Gen. [[Eugene Asa Carr|Eugene A. Carr]]'s Division, which surged out of a river meander scar, across the front of the Confederate forces, and into the enemy's breastworks, held by Brig. Gen. [[John C. Vaughn]]'s inexperienced East Tennessee Brigade. Confused and panicked, the Confederates began to withdraw across the Big Black on two bridges: the railroad bridge and the steamboat dock moored athwart the river. As soon as they had crossed, the Confederates set fire to the bridges, preventing close Union pursuit. The fleeing Confederates who arrived in Vicksburg later that day were disorganized. The Union forces captured approximately 1,800 troops at Big Black, a loss that the Confederates could ill afford.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms010.htm NPS Big Black River Bridge.]</ref>\n\n===Siege of Vicksburg (May 18&nbsp;\u2013 July 4)===\n{{main article|Siege of Vicksburg}}\n[[File:VicksburgSiege.png|thumb|300px|Siege of Vicksburg. Corps and division commanders are shown for the period June 23&nbsp;\u2013 July 4.]]\nThe Union army converged on Vicksburg, trapping Pemberton's force. Grant attempted two assaults to break through the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand's sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to arrange it in time. Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms011.htm NPS Vicksburg.]</ref>\n\nIn addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had to be concerned with Confederate forces in his rear. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as [[Mechanicsburg, Mississippi|Mechanicsburg]], both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[John G. Parke]], was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]], from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. [[Frederick Steele]] replaced him at the XV Corps on June 22. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson.<ref>Esposito, text for map 107.</ref>\n\n==Louisiana operations==\nDuring the Siege of Vicksburg, three other battles took place in the vicinity:\n\n===Milliken's Bend (June 7)===\n{{further|Battle of Milliken's Bend}}\nIn an effort to cut Grant's supply line during the siege, the Confederates attacked the Milliken's Bend supply area up the Mississippi. This was mainly defended by untrained [[African-American|black]] troops, who fought bravely with inferior weaponry and finally fought off the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at significant cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battles-detail.htm?battleCode=la011 NPS Milliken's Bend.]</ref>\n\n===Goodrich's Landing (June 29\u201330)===\n{{further|Battle of Goodrich's Landing}}\nAfter Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore, leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses for food, clothing, etc. African-American troops were assigned to protect these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an expedition from [[Gaines's Landing, Arkansas]], to Lake Providence. Although the Confederates disrupted these operations, destroyed much property, and captured many supplies and weapons, the raid was only a minor setback for the Union. The Confederates could cause momentary disturbances, but they were unable to effect any lasting changes.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/la014.htm NPS Goodrich's Landing.]</ref>\n\n===Helena (July 4)===\n{{further|Battle of Helena}}\nConfederate Lt. Gen. [[Theophilus H. Holmes]]'s troops attacked [[Helena, Arkansas]], in an attempt to relieve pressure on Vicksburg. Although the Confederates had more troops and did initially capture some of the fortifications, the Union forces repelled them.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ar008.htm NPS Helena.]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough the Confederate killed and wounded in the battle and siege of Vicksburg were a relatively small 2,872, and Union 4,910, Grant captured his second Confederate army in its entirety (the first being at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]]): 29,495 surrendered.<ref>Kennedy, p. 173.</ref> Most of the Confederates were paroled. The Union also captured significant quantities of artillery, small arms, and ammunition. The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded.<ref>Ballard, pp. 398\u201399.</ref>\n\nThis was the second major blow to the Confederacy in the summer of 1863. On July 3, Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of the North collapsed at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. On July 4, the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] rose over Vicksburg. To the Confederates, surrendering on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] was a bitter defeat. Union troops behaved well, mixing with Confederates and giving rations to starving soldiers. Speculators who had been hoarding food for higher prices saw their stores broken open and the contents thrown on the streets for the starving rebels. In his ''Personal Memoirs'', Grant observed, \"The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause.\"<ref>Grant, chapter XXXVIII, p. 38.</ref> But resentments lingered: allegedly tradition holds that the [[Fourth of July]] holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This claim has been challenged because large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldrep|first=Christopher|title=Vicksburg's Long Shadow: The Civil War Legacy Of Race And Remembrance |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0742548688 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDgeo7QYJEC&pg=PA247 |page=247}}</ref><ref>Historian Michael G. Ballard, in his ''Vicksburg'' campaign history, pp. 420-21, claims that this story has little foundation in fact. Although it is unknown whether city officials sanctioned the day as a local holiday, Southern observances of July 4 were for many years characterized more by family picnics than by formal city or county activities.</ref>\nThe most significant result of the campaign was control of the Mississippi River, which the Union obtained completely after [[Battle of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]], which had been besieged by Banks since May 27, heard news of Vicksburg's fall and surrendered on July 9. The Confederacy was now cut in two; one week later, an unarmed ship arrived in Union-held New Orleans from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after an uneventful trip down the river. President Lincoln announced, \"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 410.</ref>\n\nGrant deployed Sherman and 50,000 troops against Johnston's 31,000 in Jackson. Johnston tried to lure Sherman into a frontal assault, but Sherman had seen the results of such at Vicksburg. He demurred and began surrounding the city. Johnston escaped with his army, which was more than Pemberton had achieved, but all of central Mississippi was now under Sherman's control. He used a subsequent operation against [[Meridian, Mississippi]], as a harbinger of the [[scorched earth]] tactics he later employed in his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and then [[Carolinas campaign|South Carolina]].\n\nOne of Grant's actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]]. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. McClernand's XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord]]. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote [[Texas]].<ref>Bearss, vol. III, pp. 875\u201379; Ballard, pp. 358\u201359; Korn, pp. 147\u201348.</ref>\n\nGrant was the undisputed victor of the Vicksburg campaign. He was rewarded for his victory with a promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], effective on July 4, 1863. He also received an unusual letter:\n\n{{Quote|My dear General\n\nI do not remember that you and I ever met personally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country. I wish to say a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do, what you finally did\u2014march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed. When you got below, and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join Gen. Banks; and when you turned Northward East of the Big Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right, and I was wrong.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Lincoln<ref>Smith, p. 257.</ref>}}\n\nGrant went on to rescue Union forces besieged at [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] and then replaced Halleck as general in chief of all Union armies, with the recently re-activated rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]]. Despite his ultimate success in winning the war, historians have often considered Vicksburg his finest campaign\u2014imaginative, audacious, relentless, and a masterpiece of maneuver warfare. [[James M. McPherson]] called Vicksburg \"the most brilliant and innovative campaign of the Civil War\"; [[T. Harry Williams]] described it as \"one of the classic campaigns of the Civil War and, indeed, of military history\"; and the U.S. Army ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual&nbsp;100\u20135]]'' (May&nbsp;1986) called it \"the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil\".<ref>Bonekemper, ''A Victor, Not a Butcher'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Steven E. Woodworth]] wrote that Pemberton \"had a strong claim to the title of the most hated man in the South, certainly the most hated to wear a Confederate uniform\". There were accusations that adequate supplies had been on hand and that it was only his treachery that caused the surrender. Even his friend, Confederate general [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], wrote after the war that a large part of the population believed \"He had joined the South for the express purpose of betraying it, and this was clearly proven by the fact that he surrendered on the 4th of July, a day sacred to the Yankees.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 218.</ref><ref>David Zimring, ''To live and Die in Dixie: Native Northerners Who Fought for the Confederacy'', Univ Tennessee Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1621901068}}; p. 262.</ref>\n\nThe blame for losing Vicksburg fell not only on John Pemberton, but on the overcautious Joseph E. Johnston. Jefferson Davis said of the defeat, \"Yes, from a want of provisions inside and a General outside who wouldn't fight.\"<ref>McPherson, p. 637.</ref> Anguished soldiers and civilians starving in the siege held hopes that he would come to their aid, but he never did. Accusations of cowardice that had dogged him since the 1862 [[Peninsula Campaign]] continued to follow him in the 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign]] against Sherman. However, Johnston was far outnumbered. While he was one of few Confederate generals whom Grant respected, he was outgeneraled.\n\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:Grant Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The monument to U.S. Grant at the national military park in Vicksburg, MS, unveiled in 1919]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1863]]\n* [[List of costliest American Civil War land battles]]\n* [[Armies in the American Civil War]]\n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War]] \n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps]]\n* [[Vicksburg National Military Park]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Ballard, Michael B.

{"title_page": "Alfred Latour", "text_new": "'''Alfred Latour''' (1888, [[Paris]] \u2013 1964, [[Eygali\u00e8res]]) was a French painter and engraver who also worked extensively as a graphic designer and as an advertiser. He was notoriously against the opposition between so-called major and minor arts; he was a man of many talents, passionate about all the expressive possibilities of visual arts, crafts, and modes of expression.\n<br />\nHis vast and multifarious work includes hundreds of oils, watercolours, drawings, illustrated books, advertisement posters, vignettes and printed fabrics, some of which are still produced by the Abbaye de Fontenay. All his works express both his sense of freedom and his rigorous seriousness. His Fauve palette is combined with essential lightness and simplicity of form.\nHis works can be seen in museums in [[France]] ([[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Arles]], [[Martigues]]), in [[Great Britain]] ([[The British Museum]] and [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]]), and in [[National Library of the Netherlands]]. They are also part of many private art collections around the world.\n\nLatour was always highly independent and reserved, and had no inclination to draw attention on himself. As a result, he became a recognized painter and a successful graphic designer, but he never acquired the public recognition his work should have bestowed on him. In 2004, the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Alfred Latour Foundation] was established in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]. It is presided by Claude Latour, Alfred Latour's nephew, and is dedicated to preserving and promoting Alfred Latour's work.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nAlfred Latour was the youngest of four brothers; his father was a printer and typographer at the [[Imprimerie Nationale]]. He was born on 27 August 1888 in a working-class neighbourhood of the 12th arrondissement in [[Paris]]. From early childhood his love of drawing\u2014his parents' slight resistance notwithstanding\u2014marked him to become an artist.\n\nHis formation was very diverse. He started with evening classes in his neighbourhood, in Rue d'Aligre, and for a short time he was a student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts|Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]. However, he was rapidly turned off by the academicism of the teaching. He preferred to spend his time in the [[National Museums of Paris]] where he took many notes and made many sketches and drawings. In 1908, he received a grant from the [[Paris|City of Paris]] to attend the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. At that school he received a solid technical formation and trained his eye and his hand while searching for his own style. After he sold his first canvases, he went on a journey to the south of France, which proved to be a form of revelation whose enchantment would last all his life.\n\nHowever, Latour was conscripted in 1909 and stationed in [[Granville, Manche|Granville]], in [[Normandy]]. While on his leaves, he discovered the coast of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] of which he produced many sketches and pochades: small sketches that captured the outline and colours of the landscape.\n\nIn 1913, he settled in Paris again, on the [[Ile Saint-Louis]], which was still at the time a sort of village at the heart of the capital. He lived off the sale of canvases and drawings (mostly views of Paris and scenes of Parisian life), but also off set design for the theatre and graphic design patterns for household objects (boxes, plates, lamps and the like). That year, he presented his work for the first time at the [[Salon d'automne]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\">[http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf Biography on the website of the Foundation Alfred Latour]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n\nDuring that period, he started his work as a wood engraver. His professionalism, skilfulness and taste for meticulous and rigorous work quickly drew the recognition of his peers. The symbolist painter [[\u00c9mile Bernard]], who was practically his neighbour, commissioned the engraving of his drawings illustrating [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]]'s Les Amours and [[Les Fleurs du mal|Baudelaire's ''Les Fleurs du Mal'']], which [[Ambroise Vollard]] then published in 1914 and 1916.\n<br />\nWith the start of World War I in 1914, Latour was mobilized, and on 22 September he was seriously wounded in [[Picardy]]. While convalescing in hospital he met Madeleine Cosnard who would become his wife in 1917 and the mother of his two sons, Jacques and Jean. During these war years Latour produced a large number of drawings and snapshot-like sketches of silhouetted comrades in their daily lives and of the landscapes he passed through.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the [[Ile Saint-Louis]] where he dedicated himself exclusively to perfecting his art as a woodcutter and graphic designer. His work clearly belonged to the French tradition, but he also radically renewed that tradition with his use of colours and his acute sense of simplicity in decoration. His talent did not go unnoticed; he started to exhibit his works regularly at the [[Salon d'Automne]], at the [[Petit Palais]], where he was the recipient of several prizes, and art patrons started to include him in their collections.<ref>In June 1921, financier and famous art collector [[Otto H. Kahn]] (1867-1934) purchased several of Latour's woodcuts to donate them to American museums, in particular to the (now closed) Mus\u00e9e d'Art Fran\u00e7ais in New York. In 1925, American banker [[Jules Bache]] (1861-1944), a prominent entrepreneur and art collector who owned a splendid collection including pieces by [[Rembrandt]], [[D\u00fcrer]], and [[Velasquez]], purchased six woodcuts which he donated to the [[New York Public Library]]. In 1926, the curator of the Department of Prints wrote to Latour to tell him about an important exhibition on four centuries of the art of woodcutting; in that letter, the curator wrote: \"We are very pleased to have works of yours in the collection.\"</ref> In 1925, he was awarded the Grand Prix for book illustration at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/> That same year, he created graphic and typographic vignettes for the [[Deberny and Peignot]] foundry. Latour's innovative idea was to create iterative motifs that could be combined ad infinitum like the letters of the alphabet; the motive would prove to be a commercial success for many years.\n\nIn 1927, he settled in [[Montparnasse]], the hub of Paris artistic and intellectual life that attracted many painters, writers and musicians, many of whom were exiles. He became involved with the art book milieu, starting to work on bookbinding, embellishments and illustrations of more than thirty books.<ref>[[Louis Koopman]], a scientist, high-tech entrepreneur, art connoisseur and book lover particularly fond of French literature, included Le Voyage d'Urien, along with other books illustrated by Latour, in his famous collection of rare books. The collection is currently in the holdings of The National Library of the Netherlands.</ref> This work enabled him to become friends with many authors including poet [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], novelist [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], and art historian [[Andr\u00e9 Focillon]].<ref>In 1920 art historian [[Henri Focillon]] commissioned Latour to illustrate his book \"L'Ile oubli\u00e9e\" (\"The Forgotten Island\"); in 1953, he published an article titled ''Estampes en couleurs grav\u00e9es sur bois'' (\"Colour Woodcuts and Prints\") in Arts et M\u00e9tiers Graphiques (N\u00b029, 1953) where he wrote: \"Latour considers that wood is not simply the substance of graphic speculation, but that it also offers rich plastic possibilities that can admit the dreams of a painter.\"</ref> It also led him to receiving several prizes in international exhibitions, which he shared with renowned artists such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[Picasso]], and [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]]. His modernist aesthetic and his sober and refined style also drew the attention of the [[Lyon]] silk manufacturers [http://www.bianchiniferier.com Maison Bianchini-F\u00e9rier] who commissioned him several designs for their exclusive fabrics.\n\nHe then turned to photography, which revealed yet another aspect of his talent. He became the Paris correspondent of an international press agency.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\">Documents belonging to the Latour family (available upon request for consultation, please contact the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Foundation]).</ref> His favourite subjects were street scenes, fairs and the fishermen on the banks of the [[Seine]]. He captured these slices of life for the newspaper [[L'Ami du peuple]]<ref>[[Laure Albin Guillot]] who photographed the Parisian intelligentsia of arts and letters photographed Latour for her exhibition titled \"Portraits of Men\" that included portraits of [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], [[Julien Green]], [[Mo\u00efse Kisling]], [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] and [[Darius Milhaud]].</ref> with his quick look and his original sense of framing.\n<br />\nSuccess, however, never went to Latour's head; it actually started to irk him. He felt he needed silence and concentration to deepen his work. In 1932, he broke away from Parisian metropolitan life for which he had no affinity and bought a \"[[Mas (Proven\u00e7al farmhouse)|mas]]\" (a former sheep stable) in Eygali\u00e8res at the foot of the [[Alpilles]] mountains. In the long-desired solitude of the [[Provence]], he launched on a quest for renewed freedom; he gave up the constraints of woodcutting to devote himself freely to watercolours.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/><ref>In 1932, Latour showed his work at the Galerie La Tortue in Paris. The exhibit was very favorably reviewed in the magazine Les Echos des Arts: \"It comes as no surprise that [Latour's] painting should be as bold, as innovative in its lines, as profound in its composition and as meticulous in its design as his woodcuts were.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1934, he started to work for the wine merchant [http://www.nicolas.com [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]]]. Their collaboration would last 30 years during which Latour produced much of the advertisement for the company, including posters and the prestigious yearly catalogue of fine wines, which artists as famous as [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen|Van Dongen]] and [[Bernard Buffet]] had illustrated before him.<ref>In 1928 the dynamic director of [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Vins Nicolas]], the wine company to which he gave his name, started a luxurious yearly catalogue of his products. Famous designer and publicist [[Cassandre]] was mandated with the typography. In 1940 Latour took over the mandate and continued with this work all his life.</ref> On the other hand, when the renowned printing house Draeger that produced the material for [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]] offered Latour to become their Artistic Director, he turned down the offer saying: \"I don't want a collar on my neck, albeit a golden one.\".<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n\nLatour always observed at a distance the vanguard artistic movements of his time. Between 1935 and 1936 he joined the UAM (the [[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) a movement founded in 1929 by architect [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in reaction to the academicism of the era and the established hierarchies between major and minor arts. Prominent members of the UAM included [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. In the UAM pavilion of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]], Latour presented works in three categories: Art Books and Illustration, Graphic Art, and Advertisement.\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out, Latour was revolted by the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] France signed with Germany, which he considered a humiliating capitulation. Ostensibly, he led a quiet life as a painter in [[Eygali\u00e8res]], returning to oil painting, which he had abandoned 20 years previously. At the age of 52, however, he decided to join his son Jacques who was fighting with the partisans of the [[French R\u00e9sistance]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/><ref>Jacques participated in the actions of the [[Special Operations Executive|S.O.E.]] and was in charge of organizing the connections with England and the airdrop of armed groups placed under the authority of Commander Buckmaster in [[London]]. In France, the [[Zone libre|Zone Sud]], where Latour and his son resided, was commanded by [[Peter Churchill]]. (He was not related to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]).</ref> In 1944, Jacques was arrested and deported to [[Dachau]]. He survived and became the curator of the Arles museums after the war. Latour managed to escape arrest thanks to an early warning and hid in Lyon in a hospital administered by a religious order. This forced retreat gave him time for reflection, meditation and produced in him a late awakening to religious faith.\n\nIn 1946, he bought another house on the rocky heights of Eygali\u00e8res where he settled in two studios. One was devoted to his graphic work, while the other was the very private space he reserved for painting. The graphic work included the design of new fonts, page setting and illustrations that he worked on for the wine merchant Nicolas.<ref>Latour participated each year in the Rencontres Internationales de Lure founded by [[Maximilien Vox]]. The exposition gathered typographers, printers, designers, advertisers and publishers. Latour also became a member of the [[ATypI|International Association of Typography (ATypI)]] founded in 1951 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. The Association was founded by Charles Peignot and held its yearly conventions in different European capitals.</ref> He also started working with his friend Pierre Aynard, a silk manufacturer from [[Lyon]] and the owner of the [[Abbaye de Fontenay]]. He thus designed patterns for silk fabrics used in haute couture or in exclusive tapestries.<ref>In 1950, Brunet Lecomte produced a limited series of seven of the so-called Canvases of Fontenay. Latour would then show printed tapestries under the brand Edition des \"Toiles de Fontenay\" at the 1950 [[Salon d'Automne]].</ref>\n\nLatour kept following the developments of the arts in Paris from afar, but was irritated by the increasing influence of the art market. One day he even packed up his canvases that were about to be exhibited at the prestigious [http://www.galeriedefrance.com Galerie de France]: \"How can painters be raised in stables like race horses?\" And: \"How can their work be sold like any old kind of stuff,\" Latour protested.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n<br />\nIn his [[Provence]] retreat Latour thought of nothing but painting, though that did not keep him from cordially welcoming occasional visitors such as painter [[Mario Prassinos]], actors [[G\u00e9rard Philippe]] and [[Nicolas Bataille]], poet [[Henri Pichette]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Allix]], the Rector of the [[University of Lyon]]. Upon the insistence of his friends he also agreed to participate in a few group exhibitions and in the newly created [[Salon de Mai]]. In 1953, he exceptionally agreed to lend his works to the Parisian Galerie Carmine for a personal exhibit that turned out to be quite a success.<ref name=\"Newspaper reviews\">On 7 March 1953 Robert Vrinat wrote in L'Actualit\u00e9 Artistique Internationale: \"Alfred Latour is an artist with a rich past. This does not keep him from being on the lookout for new possibilities and from progressing with his work. In our time so agitated by multiple tendencies and trends, he develops his very personal and profoundly interesting style.\" Among the throngs of visitors one could distinguish some particularly informed amateurs, such as art critic and curator of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] [[Jean Cassou]], Latour's patron and friend Etienne Nicolas, art critic and professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France [[Andr\u00e9 Chastel]], the celebrated typographer [[Maximilien Vox]], renowned printer [[Charles Peignot]], and of course fellow painters, [[Yves Brayer]], [[L\u00e9on Gischia]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Andr\u00e9 Marchand (painter)|Andr\u00e9 Marchand]] and many others. On 1 April 1962 Francis Carlier, wrote in [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]: \"Latour's colors welcome the spectator with great commotion. His paintings have attracted to the Galerie La Calade a throng of art amateurs and connoisseurs. (...) Despite the calculated rigidity of their lines, all the works of the exhibition give the impression of intense life and silent poetry.\"\n\nOn 1 April 1962 Le M\u00e9ridional-La France published an article that said: \"Alfred Latour is a modern painter who does not yield to excess; his soul is strong, sensitive, clear and humane. Everything in his work bears the mark of great care. His motto may well be: \"put your work twenty times upon the anvil.\"\n\nIn [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]], on 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer. Through his paintings we see that man whose talent has been admired by all specialists\u2014.\"\n\nLe M\u00e9ridional \u2013 La France, on 22 April 1962, insisted: \"Alfred Latour is the author of a considerable oeuvre, but as a painter he has seldom been exhibited. That is why many connoisseurs discover his talent in that field only now. Latour leaves the beaten track and in all his works he expresses original personality. In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equaled by his immense talent.\"\n\nOn 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote in [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]]: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer.

In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equalled by his immense talent.\"\n\nJ. Samat wrote in Le M\u00e9ridional on 15 December 1962: \"Alfred Latour steers clear of any artificiality and any obvious creative process; most of all, he is not sensitive to any of the fads of the time. (...) Because he has definitively overcome all technical problems, his conception of nature reaches us through movingly sparse expression and it seems that each work is an open window onto his soul, as each work fills us with a wonderful feeling of peace, light and youth.\n<br />\nLast, but not least, Camille Rouvier, in Le Proven\u00e7al on 19 December 1962 stated: \"Latour's work is made of classic balance \u2014 it is a balance that is eternal and always new! His art is that of the geometry of space. The straight line, the Golden Rule of drawing, is the trademark of his righteousness and probity. Some complain that they find that this painting cold \u2014 as if Bach's music was could be cold!\"\n</ref> However, Latour only started to feel the pressing need to make his painting better known after 1962 when he started to become alarmed by his developing heart condition. He then showed his work at the Galerie La Calade, in [[Avignon]], the Galerie Garibaldi in [[Marseille]], as well as at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in [[Paris]]. In all cases the reviews were unanimously eulogistic.\n\nLatour died in his studio after suffering a stroke on 4 March 1964 at the age of 76.\n\n== The Work of Alfred Latour ==\n\nRigorousness and freedom, modernity and independence, geometry and lyricism: these could be the key words defining the vast variety of Latour's talents and skills. The man was an explorer of art and he loved to venture into uncharted territories, meet new challenges and develop new techniques of visual expression. However, to him this diversity of approaches really meant searching for profound coherence. Whether it was in a landscape, in framing a photograph, etching a vignette, conceiving a poster for an ad or drawing a design for a fabric, he permanently rejected academicism, hackneyed tradition and ready-made solutions. He always showed his independence and resolutely refused to be enrolled in any school or movement. The history of these vanguards and their ideologies bore little relation to his personal history. Latour was certainly a Modernist, but not a diehard revolutionary artist: he sought to reinterpret the artistic tradition in the light of his own perception of the world and reach through it an ideal of essential simplicity.\n\n=== The Painted Work and Drawing ===\n\nAt the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]], the teaching of painting was still very much under the influence of [[Impressionism]]. In 1908, however, [[Impressionism]] had lost most of its attraction; even [[Monet]] had left it behind to explore new forms. At the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Matisse]] and the other [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] scandalized the small world of art by totally freeing color, and in 1907 [[Picasso]]'s [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] ignited the controversy of the [[Cubist|Cubism]] revolution and its ingenious deconstruction of space. Latour observed all this, but kept looking for a language of his own.\n<br />\nFrom his early sketches in Paris or in Normandy, Latour's technique had always been sure, self-reliant and fluid; he never sought to describe but rather to evoke with an innate sense of formal ellipsis and economy of means. His impressionist schooling gave him a feel for atmospheric skies, moving waters and intense ambiances that he produced through the supple strokes of his brush. From the start too he sought to push very far the simplification of forms, leaving details aside to attain comprehensible and vivid, though pared down, visions of the world.\n\nHis work is akin to visual haikus: the painting bears the somewhat hard trace of his brush; his drawings are \"written\" in hasty and tense ink gravid with allusion. Latour was a master of blacks and greys on bistre-coloured paper; with a few strokes he knew how to enhance the light on the paper and thus managed to convey the vastness and the energy of skies and sees in very small pieces. Even diminutive woodcuts, be they portraits or landscapes, bear the mark of his spirited style.\n<br />\nThe encounter with the southern light of [[Provence]] in the 1930s and 1940s opened up his palette and enriched it with the solar hues of a tamed [[Fauvism]]. The colours of the works of that period are intense but much less burning than [[Matisse]]'s, [[Derain]]'s and [[Braque]]'s pyrotechnics of the 1910s. From 1940, Latour returned to oil painting that he had abandoned 20 years before and developed a chromatist lyricism he had inherited from [[Fauvism]]. He also used this chromatic palette with bluish shadows that structure the arid and rocky landscapes he painted of [[Eygali\u00e8res]].\n<br />\nLatour's quest for formal freedom, for more light and simplicity, did not stop there. He was a man that kept going back indefatigably, almost obsessively, to his work. In the mid-1940s oil painting had the lion's share in Latour's production, which expressed the evident pleasure he must have had to paint. The post-war years were a new era for him, and in his increasingly free style pieces such as \"The Banks of the Rh\u00f4ne\", \"Les Sainte-Maries de la Mer\", and \"Avignon\" now consisted of solid surfaces of color, silhouetted shapes and stylized forms. The drawings too seem to have been made with one quick remorseless stroke and capture stenographically the laconic and expressive sparseness of the [[Alpilles]] or the [[Camargue]].\n\nLatour's quest for simplicity took him to the brim of abstraction, though he never made the final step. His work gradually evolved toward a poetic code that enabled him to evoke with a few lines and a few colour strokes a \"Landscape in the [[Beaujolais]]\", the contours of \"Avignon\", \"Collioures\", the mountains, the [[Alpilles]], white clouds, rice fields, and \"Tulips against a Red Backdrop\". From the end of the 1940s to his last landscapes and bouquets, Latour flirted with geometry both rigorously and playfully. His geometric compositions are made of colour surfaces that his drawing lines\u2014sometimes as fine as a pencil and sometimes as thick as brush stroke\u2014cross freely. In these late works it is as if colour and form were autonomous; they are like two musical scores that respond to and echo each other in superimpositions, crossings and counterpoint.\n\nThe novelist [[Henri Feyt]] and the Director of [[Gallimard]], [[Louis Evrard]], tell the following anecdote: on a spring day of 1969, [[Picasso]]\u2014who would never miss the Easter bullfight in [[Arles]]\u2014noticed a painting on the wall of Andr\u00e9's bookstore in that town. \"Who is this by?\" he asked. \"Alfred Latour; he is dead now,\" was the storeowner's reply. \"How come I never met him?\" wondered the great Pablo.<ref>The anecdote was told to Madeleine Latour by Mr. Andr\u00e9, the owner of the bookshop: page 27 of the full biography of Alfred Latour [http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf internet site]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the Foundation Alfred Latour</ref>\n\n=== The Graphic Work ===\n\nLatour's graphic work may appear to be close to that of [[Raoul Dufy]], not just because the two men were born and died exactly 11 years apart, but more importantly because like him he was a one-man band of visual arts. He was an artist who mastered (almost) all techniques and languages of pictorial representation: he was a painter and a drawer, of course, but also a wood engraver, a publicist, a font designer, a bookbinder, an illustrator, a set designer, a graphic designer for objects and fabric patterns, a tapestry designer and a photographer. Although painting was at the heart of his creation, the rest of his activities were not mere potboilers. The diversity of his activities was central to the UAM's ([[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) programme, the movement founded in 1929 by [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]]. Although he detested being enrolled in anything, Latour joined the movement in 1935-36 as a \"graphic designer.\" Latour was thus close to [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Cassandre]], [[Jean Lur\u00e7at]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who all shared a distaste for the academicism of the era and the hierarchies between so-called major and minor arts.\n<br />\nLatour's father was a printer and a typographer. The son inherited a sense for good work and a permanent yearning for perfection from his father. Latour's graphic work has \"secured him a choice place in the Golden Book of Print,\" said Roger Ch\u00e2telain, a former Dean of the [[Lausanne]] [[Ecole Romande d'Art Graphiques]] (ERAG). Ch\u00e2telain also underlined the very special place Latour occupies in that book. As with painting, Latour never sought to make his graphic work part of the vanguard that was made up of the Russian [[Suprematism|Suprematists]], the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]], the Dutch of the [[De Stijl]] group and the German school of the [[Bauhaus]].\n<br />\nIn 1908, Austrian architect [[Adolph Loos]] had summed up the extreme rigorousness of radical [[Modernists]] by declaring: \"Ornament is a crime.\" Latour remained faithful to the French tradition he inherited from his father whose taste, in particular for ornament, was resolutely old-fashioned in comparison with the Modernism of the time. Latour's first woodcuts for book illustrations\u2014head letters, frontispieces, ex libris, views of Paris, landscapes and still lives\u2014show Latour was still very much influenced by the French tradition, though they also show his tendency to simplification and graphic effectiveness. The same can be observed in his early illustrated books with works by [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Henri Focillon]]. Soon, however, Latour's graphic work took a sharp modern turn, in particular in his posters, his ads for the newspapers, his surprisingly simple and purified bookbinding design and his inventively simple fabric designs. All these creations bear witness to his tasteful use of colour and the refined rigorousness with which he introduced combinations and variations on playful geometry and sparse composition.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nCamera in hand, Latour immediately demonstrated he had a photographer's eye. He did not leave an extensive photographic output, but it is of high quality. Latour was the correspondent of a press agency, but his work is not so much documentary as poetic. He seized in black and white shards of life and of the world, minuscule evanescent events of everyday life that his camera arrested in flight. His subjects include pedestrians crossing a street viewed from below knee level, a motorcycle hoisted aboard a ship that seems to be flying through the air, or a fisherman whose amiable smile appears to be squeezed between his Gallic moustache and the beret jammed on his head. He also captured passers-by that look like Lilliputians in front of a giant advertisement for the [[Galeries Lafayette]], people seen from the back as they are looking from a bridge on the [[Seine]] which is not visible in the picture, or an odd and playful accumulation of pipes, wigs, hot-water bottles in a store window. Latour was artistic kin to other street poets like [[Robert Doisneau]], [[Willy Ronis]] and [[Edouard Boubat]]. His keen and mobile eye sought new angles, from above or from below: a bird's-eye view of a bottle of wine and a slice of bread transforms the latter into an original still life. He could focus on a detail and find delight in almost nothing. He would frame precisely and only what he was interested in, even if that meant cutting heads, leaving out the second wheel of a bicycle, or use the windshield of a car as a frame within the frame.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Painting and drawing ===\n* 1910: Grandville, drawing, ink and pencil, 11,5 x 17,5&nbsp;cm.\n* 1913: The Woods, woodcut, 13 x 18&nbsp;cm.\n* 1916: War Sketch, ink, 10,4 x 16,2&nbsp;cm.\n* 1936: Mas in the Alpilles, watercolor, 29 x 43&nbsp;cm.\n* 1941: Eygali\u00e8res, oil on cardboard, 33 x 41&nbsp;cm.\n* 1945: Avignon, oil on paper, 50 x 65&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: Landscape of the Beaujolais, oil on canvas, 73 x 92&nbsp;cm.\n* 1954: The Alpilles and White Clouds, oil on canvas, 115 x 146&nbsp;cm.\n* 1957: Tulips on Red Backdrop, oil on canvas, 65 x 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Graphic work ===\n* 1920: Henri Focillon, L'\u00eele oubli\u00e9e (\"The Forgotten Island\"), illustrated book, woodcut, 11 x 9&nbsp;cm, (1 picture).\n* 1928: Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil, frontispiece, Illustrated book, woodcut, 12 x 8&nbsp;cm.\n* c. 1960: Nicolas Wines: Advertisement poster, 300 x 500&nbsp;cm.\n* 1929: Les Coquillages (\"Shells\"), graphic design on fabric, (printed Tournon fabric), 31 x 28&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: design for fabric, 49 x 64&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nFrom the Catalogue of Latour's Works, nt., nd.\n* P. 9 : The Wigmaker's Shop Window (c. 1936).\n* P. 14: Photo journalism: Sleepers on a Bench (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;16\u201317: Passers-By (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;22\u201323: Portrait of a Fisherman and Sill Life (c. 1936).\n* P. 27: The Flying Motorcycle (c. 1932).\n\n== Main distinctions and exhibitions ==\n* 1913: Paris Salon d'Automne.

He was notoriously against the opposition between so-called major and minor arts; he was a man of many talents, passionate about all the expressive possibilities of visual arts, crafts, and modes of expression.\n<br />\nHis vast and multifarious work includes hundreds of oils, watercolours, drawings, illustrated books, advertisement posters, vignettes and printed fabrics, some of which are still produced by the Abbaye de Fontenay. All his works express both his sense of freedom and his rigorous seriousness. His Fauve palette is combined with essential lightness and simplicity of form.\nHis works can be seen in museums in [[France]] ([[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Arles]], [[Martigues]]), in [[Great Britain]] ([[The British Museum]] and [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]]), and in [[National Library of the Netherlands]]. They are also part of many private art collections around the world.\n\nLatour was always highly independent and reserved, and had no inclination to draw attention on himself. As a result, he became a recognized painter and a successful graphic designer, but he never acquired the public recognition his work should have bestowed on him. In 2004, the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Alfred Latour Foundation] was established in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]. It is presided by Claude Latour, Alfred Latour's nephew, and is dedicated to preserving and promoting Alfred Latour's work.\n\n== Biography ==\n\nAlfred Latour was the youngest of four brothers; his father was a printer and typographer at the [[Imprimerie Nationale]]. He was born on 27 August 1888 in a working-class neighbourhood of the 12th arrondissement in [[Paris]]. From early childhood his love of drawing\u2014his parents' slight resistance notwithstanding\u2014marked him to become an artist.\n\nHis formation was very diverse. He started with evening classes in his neighbourhood, in Rue d'Aligre, and for a short time he was a student at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts|Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts]]. However, he was rapidly turned off by the academicism of the teaching. He preferred to spend his time in the [[National Museums of Paris]] where he took many notes and made many sketches and drawings. In 1908, he received a grant from the [[Paris|City of Paris]] to attend the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. At that school he received a solid technical formation and trained his eye and his hand while searching for his own style. After he sold his first canvases, he went on a journey to the south of France, which proved to be a form of revelation whose enchantment would last all his life.\n\nHowever, Latour was conscripted in 1909 and stationed in [[Granville, Manche|Granville]], in [[Normandy]]. While on his leaves, he discovered the coast of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] of which he produced many sketches and pochades: small sketches that captured the outline and colours of the landscape.\n\nIn 1913, he settled in Paris again, on the [[Ile Saint-Louis]], which was still at the time a sort of village at the heart of the capital. He lived off the sale of canvases and drawings (mostly views of Paris and scenes of Parisian life), but also off set design for the theatre and graphic design patterns for household objects (boxes, plates, lamps and the like). That year, he presented his work for the first time at the [[Salon d'automne]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\">[http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf Biography on the website of the Foundation Alfred Latour]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n\nDuring that period, he started his work as a wood engraver. His professionalism, skilfulness and taste for meticulous and rigorous work quickly drew the recognition of his peers. The symbolist painter [[\u00c9mile Bernard]], who was practically his neighbour, commissioned the engraving of his drawings illustrating [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]]'s Les Amours and [[Les Fleurs du mal|Baudelaire's ''Les Fleurs du Mal'']], which [[Ambroise Vollard]] then published in 1914 and 1916.\n<br />\nWith the start of World War I in 1914, Latour was mobilized, and on 22 September he was seriously wounded in [[Picardy]]. While convalescing in hospital he met Madeleine Cosnard who would become his wife in 1917 and the mother of his two sons, Jacques and Jean. During these war years Latour produced a large number of drawings and snapshot-like sketches of silhouetted comrades in their daily lives and of the landscapes he passed through.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the [[Ile Saint-Louis]] where he dedicated himself exclusively to perfecting his art as a woodcutter and graphic designer. His work clearly belonged to the French tradition, but he also radically renewed that tradition with his use of colours and his acute sense of simplicity in decoration. His talent did not go unnoticed; he started to exhibit his works regularly at the [[Salon d'Automne]], at the [[Petit Palais]], where he was the recipient of several prizes, and art patrons started to include him in their collections.<ref>In June 1921, financier and famous art collector [[Otto H. Kahn]] (1867-1934) purchased several of Latour's woodcuts to donate them to American museums, in particular to the (now closed) Mus\u00e9e d'Art Fran\u00e7ais in New York. In 1925, American banker [[Jules Bache]] (1861-1944), a prominent entrepreneur and art collector who owned a splendid collection including pieces by [[Rembrandt]], [[D\u00fcrer]], and [[Velasquez]], purchased six woodcuts which he donated to the [[New York Public Library]]. In 1926, the curator of the Department of Prints wrote to Latour to tell him about an important exhibition on four centuries of the art of woodcutting; in that letter, the curator wrote: \"We are very pleased to have works of yours in the collection.\"</ref> In 1925, he was awarded the Grand Prix for book illustration at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/> That same year, he created graphic and typographic vignettes for the [[Deberny and Peignot]] foundry. Latour's innovative idea was to create iterative motifs that could be combined ad infinitum like the letters of the alphabet; the motive would prove to be a commercial success for many years.\n\nIn 1927, he settled in [[Montparnasse]], the hub of Paris artistic and intellectual life that attracted many painters, writers and musicians, many of whom were exiles. He became involved with the art book milieu, starting to work on bookbinding, embellishments and illustrations of more than thirty books.<ref>[[Louis Koopman]], a scientist, high-tech entrepreneur, art connoisseur and book lover particularly fond of French literature, included Le Voyage d'Urien, along with other books illustrated by Latour, in his famous collection of rare books. The collection is currently in the holdings of The National Library of the Netherlands.</ref> This work enabled him to become friends with many authors including poet [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], novelist [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], and art historian [[Andr\u00e9 Focillon]].<ref>In 1920 art historian [[Henri Focillon]] commissioned Latour to illustrate his book \"L'Ile oubli\u00e9e\" (\"The Forgotten Island\"); in 1953, he published an article titled ''Estampes en couleurs grav\u00e9es sur bois'' (\"Colour Woodcuts and Prints\") in Arts et M\u00e9tiers Graphiques (N\u00b029, 1953) where he wrote: \"Latour considers that wood is not simply the substance of graphic speculation, but that it also offers rich plastic possibilities that can admit the dreams of a painter.\"</ref> It also led him to receiving several prizes in international exhibitions, which he shared with renowned artists such as [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Raoul Dufy|Dufy]], [[Picasso]], and [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]]. His modernist aesthetic and his sober and refined style also drew the attention of the [[Lyon]] silk manufacturers [http://www.bianchiniferier.com Maison Bianchini-F\u00e9rier] who commissioned him several designs for their exclusive fabrics.\n\nHe then turned to photography, which revealed yet another aspect of his talent. He became the Paris correspondent of an international press agency.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\">Documents belonging to the Latour family (available upon request for consultation, please contact the [http://www.alfred-latour.org Foundation]).</ref> His favourite subjects were street scenes, fairs and the fishermen on the banks of the [[Seine]]. He captured these slices of life for the newspaper [[L'Ami du peuple]]<ref>[[Laure Albin Guillot]] who photographed the Parisian intelligentsia of arts and letters photographed Latour for her exhibition titled \"Portraits of Men\" that included portraits of [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], [[Julien Green]], [[Mo\u00efse Kisling]], [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] and [[Darius Milhaud]].</ref> with his quick look and his original sense of framing.\n<br />\nSuccess, however, never went to Latour's head; it actually started to irk him. He felt he needed silence and concentration to deepen his work. In 1932, he broke away from Parisian metropolitan life for which he had no affinity and bought a \"[[Mas (Proven\u00e7al farmhouse)|mas]]\" (a former sheep stable) in Eygali\u00e8res at the foot of the [[Alpilles]] mountains. In the long-desired solitude of the [[Provence]], he launched on a quest for renewed freedom; he gave up the constraints of woodcutting to devote himself freely to watercolours.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/><ref>In 1932, Latour showed his work at the Galerie La Tortue in Paris. The exhibit was very favorably reviewed in the magazine Les Echos des Arts: \"It comes as no surprise that [Latour's] painting should be as bold, as innovative in its lines, as profound in its composition and as meticulous in its design as his woodcuts were.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1934, he started to work for the wine merchant [http://www.nicolas.com [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]]]. Their collaboration would last 30 years during which Latour produced much of the advertisement for the company, including posters and the prestigious yearly catalogue of fine wines, which artists as famous as [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Kees van Dongen|Van Dongen]] and [[Bernard Buffet]] had illustrated before him.<ref>In 1928 the dynamic director of [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Vins Nicolas]], the wine company to which he gave his name, started a luxurious yearly catalogue of his products. Famous designer and publicist [[Cassandre]] was mandated with the typography. In 1940 Latour took over the mandate and continued with this work all his life.</ref> On the other hand, when the renowned printing house Draeger that produced the material for [[Nicolas (wine retailer)|Nicolas]] offered Latour to become their Artistic Director, he turned down the offer saying: \"I don't want a collar on my neck, albeit a golden one.\".<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n\nLatour always observed at a distance the vanguard artistic movements of his time. Between 1935 and 1936 he joined the UAM (the [[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) a movement founded in 1929 by architect [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in reaction to the academicism of the era and the established hierarchies between major and minor arts. Prominent members of the UAM included [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. In the UAM pavilion of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]], Latour presented works in three categories: Art Books and Illustration, Graphic Art, and Advertisement.\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out, Latour was revolted by the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] France signed with Germany, which he considered a humiliating capitulation. Ostensibly, he led a quiet life as a painter in [[Eygali\u00e8res]], returning to oil painting, which he had abandoned 20 years previously. At the age of 52, however, he decided to join his son Jacques who was fighting with the partisans of the [[French R\u00e9sistance]].<ref name=\"Latour_Bio\"/><ref>Jacques participated in the actions of the [[Special Operations Executive|S.O.E.]] and was in charge of organizing the connections with England and the airdrop of armed groups placed under the authority of Commander Buckmaster in [[London]]. In France, the [[Zone libre|Zone Sud]], where Latour and his son resided, was commanded by [[Peter Churchill]]. (He was not related to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]).</ref> In 1944, Jacques was arrested and deported to [[Dachau]]. He survived and became the curator of the Arles museums after the war. Latour managed to escape arrest thanks to an early warning and hid in Lyon in a hospital administered by a religious order. This forced retreat gave him time for reflection, meditation and produced in him a late awakening to religious faith.\n\nIn 1946, he bought another house on the rocky heights of Eygali\u00e8res where he settled in two studios. One was devoted to his graphic work, while the other was the very private space he reserved for painting. The graphic work included the design of new fonts, page setting and illustrations that he worked on for the wine merchant Nicolas.<ref>Latour participated each year in the Rencontres Internationales de Lure founded by [[Maximilien Vox]]. The exposition gathered typographers, printers, designers, advertisers and publishers. Latour also became a member of the [[ATypI|International Association of Typography (ATypl)]] founded in 1951 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. The Association was founded by Charles Peignot and held its yearly conventions in different European capitals.</ref> He also started working with his friend Pierre Aynard, a silk manufacturer from [[Lyon]] and the owner of the [[Abbaye de Fontenay]]. He thus designed patterns for silk fabrics used in haute couture or in exclusive tapestries.<ref>In 1950, Brunet Lecomte produced a limited series of seven of the so-called Canvases of Fontenay. Latour would then show printed tapestries under the brand Edition des \"Toiles de Fontenay\" at the 1950 [[Salon d'Automne]].</ref>\n\nLatour kept following the developments of the arts in Paris from afar, but was irritated by the increasing influence of the art market. One day he even packed up his canvases that were about to be exhibited at the prestigious [http://www.galeriedefrance.com Galerie de France]: \"How can painters be raised in stables like race horses?\" And: \"How can their work be sold like any old kind of stuff,\" Latour protested.<ref name=\"Latour_Doc\"/>\n<br />\nIn his [[Provence]] retreat Latour thought of nothing but painting, though that did not keep him from cordially welcoming occasional visitors such as painter [[Mario Prassinos]], actors [[G\u00e9rard Philippe]] and [[Nicolas Bataille]], poet [[Henri Pichette]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Allix]], the Rector of the [[University of Lyon]]. Upon the insistence of his friends he also agreed to participate in a few group exhibitions and in the newly created [[Salon de Mai]]. In 1953, he exceptionally agreed to lend his works to the Parisian Galerie Carmine for a personal exhibit that turned out to be quite a success.<ref name=\"Newspaper reviews\">On 7 March 1953 Robert Vrinat wrote in L'Actualit\u00e9 Artistique Internationale: \"Alfred Latour is an artist with a rich past. This does not keep him from being on the lookout for new possibilities and from progressing with his work. In our time so agitated by multiple tendencies and trends, he develops his very personal and profoundly interesting style.\" Among the throngs of visitors one could distinguish some particularly informed amateurs, such as art critic and curator of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] [[Jean Cassou]], Latour's patron and friend Etienne Nicolas, art critic and professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France [[Andr\u00e9 Chastel]], the celebrated typographer [[Maximilien Vox]], renowned printer [[Charles Peignot]], and of course fellow painters, [[Yves Brayer]], [[L\u00e9on Gischia]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Andr\u00e9 Marchand (painter)|Andr\u00e9 Marchand]] and many others. On 1 April 1962 Francis Carlier, wrote in [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]: \"Latour's colors welcome the spectator with great commotion. His paintings have attracted to the Galerie La Calade a throng of art amateurs and connoisseurs. (...) Despite the calculated rigidity of their lines, all the works of the exhibition give the impression of intense life and silent poetry.\"\n\nOn 1 April 1962 Le M\u00e9ridional-La France published an article that said: \"Alfred Latour is a modern painter who does not yield to excess; his soul is strong, sensitive, clear and humane. Everything in his work bears the mark of great care. His motto may well be: \"put your work twenty times upon the anvil.\"\n\nIn [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]], on 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer. Through his paintings we see that man whose talent has been admired by all specialists\u2014.\"\n\nLe M\u00e9ridional \u2013 La France, on 22 April 1962, insisted: \"Alfred Latour is the author of a considerable oeuvre, but as a painter he has seldom been exhibited. That is why many connoisseurs discover his talent in that field only now. Latour leaves the beaten track and in all his works he expresses original personality. In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equaled by his immense talent.\"\n\nOn 19 April 1962, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cingria wrote in [[Les Lettres Fran\u00e7aises]]: \"Everything in Latour's painting reminds us that he has been at the same time an extraordinary engraver and a typographer. Through his paintings we see that man whose talent has been admired by all specialists\u2014.\"\n\nLe M\u00e9ridional \u2013 La France, on 22 April 1962, insisted: \"Alfred Latour is the author of a considerable oeuvre, but as a painter he has seldom been exhibited.

In everyday life, his main trait is his modesty which is only equalled by his immense talent.\"\n\nJ. Samat wrote in Le M\u00e9ridional on 15 December 1962: \"Alfred Latour steers clear of any artificiality and any obvious creative process; most of all, he is not sensitive to any of the fads of the time. (...) Because he has definitively overcome all technical problems, his conception of nature reaches us through movingly sparse expression and it seems that each work is an open window onto his soul, as each work fills us with a wonderful feeling of peace, light and youth.\n<br />\nLast, but not least, Camille Rouvier, in Le Proven\u00e7al on 19 December 1962 stated: \"Latour's work is made of classic balance \u2014 it is a balance that is eternal and always new! His art is that of the geometry of space. The straight line, the Golden Rule of drawing, is the trademark of his righteousness and probity. Some complain that they find that this painting cold \u2014 as if Bach's music was could be cold!\"\n</ref> However, Latour only started to feel the pressing need to make his painting better known after 1962 when he started to become alarmed by his developing heart condition. He then showed his work at the Galerie La Calade, in [[Avignon]], the Galerie Garibaldi in [[Marseille]], as well as at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in [[Paris]]. In all cases the reviews were unanimously eulogistic.\n\nLatour died in his studio after suffering a stroke on 4 March 1964 at the age of 76.\n\n== The Work of Alfred Latour ==\n\nRigorousness and freedom, modernity and independence, geometry and lyricism: these could be the key words defining the vast variety of Latour's talents and skills. The man was an explorer of art and he loved to venture into uncharted territories, meet new challenges and develop new techniques of visual expression. However, to him this diversity of approaches really meant searching for profound coherence. Whether it was in a landscape, in framing a photograph, etching a vignette, conceiving a poster for an ad or drawing a design for a fabric, he permanently rejected academicism, hackneyed tradition and ready-made solutions. He always showed his independence and resolutely refused to be enrolled in any school or movement. The history of these vanguards and their ideologies bore little relation to his personal history. Latour was certainly a Modernist, but not a diehard revolutionary artist: he sought to reinterpret the artistic tradition in the light of his own perception of the world and reach through it an ideal of essential simplicity.\n\n=== The Painted Work and Drawing ===\n\nAt the [[Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]], the teaching of painting was still very much under the influence of [[Impressionism]]. In 1908, however, [[Impressionism]] had lost most of its attraction; even [[Monet]] had left it behind to explore new forms. At the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Matisse]] and the other [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] scandalized the small world of art by totally freeing color, and in 1907 [[Picasso]]'s [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] ignited the controversy of the [[Cubist|Cubism]] revolution and its ingenious deconstruction of space. Latour observed all this, but kept looking for a language of his own.\n<br />\nFrom his early sketches in Paris or in Normandy, Latour's technique had always been sure, self-reliant and fluid; he never sought to describe but rather to evoke with an innate sense of formal ellipsis and economy of means. His impressionist schooling gave him a feel for atmospheric skies, moving waters and intense ambiances that he produced through the supple strokes of his brush. From the start too he sought to push very far the simplification of forms, leaving details aside to attain comprehensible and vivid, though pared down, visions of the world.\n\nHis work is akin to visual haikus: the painting bears the somewhat hard trace of his brush; his drawings are \"written\" in hasty and tense ink gravid with allusion. Latour was a master of blacks and greys on bistre-coloured paper; with a few strokes he knew how to enhance the light on the paper and thus managed to convey the vastness and the energy of skies and sees in very small pieces. Even diminutive woodcuts, be they portraits or landscapes, bear the mark of his spirited style.\n<br />\nThe encounter with the southern light of [[Provence]] in the 1930s and 1940s opened up his palette and enriched it with the solar hues of a tamed [[Fauvism]]. The colours of the works of that period are intense but much less burning than [[Matisse]]'s, [[Derain]]'s and [[Braque]]'s pyrotechnics of the 1910s. From 1940, Latour returned to oil painting that he had abandoned 20 years before and developed a chromatist lyricism he had inherited from [[Fauvism]]. He also used this chromatic palette with bluish shadows that structure the arid and rocky landscapes he painted of [[Eygali\u00e8res]].\n<br />\nLatour's quest for formal freedom, for more light and simplicity, did not stop there. He was a man that kept going back indefatigably, almost obsessively, to his work. In the mid-1940s oil painting had the lion's share in Latour's production, which expressed the evident pleasure he must have had to paint. The post-war years were a new era for him, and in his increasingly free style pieces such as \"The Banks of the Rh\u00f4ne\", \"Les Sainte-Maries de la Mer\", and \"Avignon\" now consisted of solid surfaces of color, silhouetted shapes and stylized forms. The drawings too seem to have been made with one quick remorseless stroke and capture stenographically the laconic and expressive sparseness of the [[Alpilles]] or the [[Camargue]].\n\nLatour's quest for simplicity took him to the brim of abstraction, though he never made the final step. His work gradually evolved toward a poetic code that enabled him to evoke with a few lines and a few colour strokes a \"Landscape in the [[Beaujolais]]\", the contours of \"Avignon\", \"Collioures\", the mountains, the [[Alpilles]], white clouds, rice fields, and \"Tulips against a Red Backdrop\". From the end of the 1940s to his last landscapes and bouquets, Latour flirted with geometry both rigorously and playfully. His geometric compositions are made of colour surfaces that his drawing lines\u2014sometimes as fine as a pencil and sometimes as thick as brush stroke\u2014cross freely. In these late works it is as if colour and form were autonomous; they are like two musical scores that respond to and echo each other in superimpositions, crossings and counterpoint.\n\nThe novelist [[Henri Feyt]] and the Director of [[Gallimard]], [[Louis Evrard]], tell the following anecdote: on a spring day of 1969, [[Picasso]]\u2014who would never miss the Easter bullfight in [[Arles]]\u2014noticed a painting on the wall of Andr\u00e9's bookstore in that town. \"Who is this by?\" he asked. \"Alfred Latour; he is dead now,\" was the storeowner's reply. \"How come I never met him?\" wondered the great Pablo.<ref>The anecdote was told to Madeleine Latour by Mr. Andr\u00e9, the owner of the bookshop: page 27 of the full biography of Alfred Latour [http://www.alfred-latour.org/alfred_latour/files/latour_biography.pdf internet site]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the Foundation Alfred Latour</ref>\n\n=== The Graphic Work ===\n\nLatour's graphic work may appear to be close to that of [[Raoul Dufy]], not just because the two men were born and died exactly 11 years apart, but more importantly because like him he was a one-man band of visual arts. He was an artist who mastered (almost) all techniques and languages of pictorial representation: he was a painter and a drawer, of course, but also a wood engraver, a publicist, a font designer, a bookbinder, an illustrator, a set designer, a graphic designer for objects and fabric patterns, a tapestry designer and a photographer. Although painting was at the heart of his creation, the rest of his activities were not mere potboilers. The diversity of his activities was central to the UAM's ([[Union des Artistes Modernes]]) programme, the movement founded in 1929 by [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]]. Although he detested being enrolled in anything, Latour joined the movement in 1935-36 as a \"graphic designer.\" Latour was thus close to [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pierre Jeanneret]], [[Charlotte Perriand]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[Man Ray]], [[Cassandre]], [[Jean Lur\u00e7at]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who all shared a distaste for the academicism of the era and the hierarchies between so-called major and minor arts.\n<br />\nLatour's father was a printer and a typographer. The son inherited a sense for good work and a permanent yearning for perfection from his father. Latour's graphic work has \"secured him a choice place in the Golden Book of Print,\" said Roger Ch\u00e2telain, a former Dean of the [[Lausanne]] [[Ecole Romande d'Art Graphiques]] (ERAG). Ch\u00e2telain also underlined the very special place Latour occupies in that book. As with painting, Latour never sought to make his graphic work part of the vanguard that was made up of the Russian [[Suprematism|Suprematists]], the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]], the Dutch of the [[De Stijl]] group and the German school of the [[Bauhaus]].\n<br />\nIn 1908, Austrian architect [[Adolph Loos]] had summed up the extreme rigorousness of radical [[Modernists]] by declaring: \"Ornament is a crime.\" Latour remained faithful to the French tradition he inherited from his father whose taste, in particular for ornament, was resolutely old-fashioned in comparison with the Modernism of the time. Latour's first woodcuts for book illustrations\u2014head letters, frontispieces, ex libris, views of Paris, landscapes and still lives\u2014show Latour was still very much influenced by the French tradition, though they also show his tendency to simplification and graphic effectiveness. The same can be observed in his early illustrated books with works by [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Henri Focillon]]. Soon, however, Latour's graphic work took a sharp modern turn, in particular in his posters, his ads for the newspapers, his surprisingly simple and purified bookbinding design and his inventively simple fabric designs. All these creations bear witness to his tasteful use of colour and the refined rigorousness with which he introduced combinations and variations on playful geometry and sparse composition.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nCamera in hand, Latour immediately demonstrated he had a photographer's eye. He did not leave an extensive photographic output, but it is of high quality. Latour was the correspondent of a press agency, but his work is not so much documentary as poetic. He seized in black and white shards of life and of the world, minuscule evanescent events of everyday life that his camera arrested in flight. His subjects include pedestrians crossing a street viewed from below knee level, a motorcycle hoisted aboard a ship that seems to be flying through the air, or a fisherman whose amiable smile appears to be squeezed between his Gallic moustache and the beret jammed on his head. He also captured passers-by that look like Lilliputians in front of a giant advertisement for the [[Galeries Lafayette]], people seen from the back as they are looking from a bridge on the [[Seine]] which is not visible in the picture, or an odd and playful accumulation of pipes, wigs, hot-water bottles in a store window. Latour was artistic kin to other street poets like [[Robert Doisneau]], [[Willy Ronis]] and [[Edouard Boubat]]. His keen and mobile eye sought new angles, from above or from below: a bird's-eye view of a bottle of wine and a slice of bread transforms the latter into an original still life. He could focus on a detail and find delight in almost nothing. He would frame precisely and only what he was interested in, even if that meant cutting heads, leaving out the second wheel of a bicycle, or use the windshield of a car as a frame within the frame.\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Painting and drawing ===\n* 1910: Grandville, drawing, ink and pencil, 11,5 x 17,5&nbsp;cm.\n* 1913: The Woods, woodcut, 13 x 18&nbsp;cm.\n* 1916: War Sketch, ink, 10,4 x 16,2&nbsp;cm.\n* 1936: Mas in the Alpilles, watercolor, 29 x 43&nbsp;cm.\n* 1941: Eygali\u00e8res, oil on cardboard, 33 x 41&nbsp;cm.\n* 1945: Avignon, oil on paper, 50 x 65&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: Landscape of the Beaujolais, oil on canvas, 73 x 92&nbsp;cm.\n* 1954: The Alpilles and White Clouds, oil on canvas, 115 x 146&nbsp;cm.\n* 1957: Tulips on Red Backdrop, oil on canvas, 65 x 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Graphic work ===\n* 1920: Henri Focillon, L'\u00eele oubli\u00e9e (\"The Forgotten Island\"), illustrated book, woodcut, 11 x 9&nbsp;cm, (1 picture).\n* 1928: Charles Baudelaire, The Flowers of Evil, frontispiece, Illustrated book, woodcut, 12 x 8&nbsp;cm.\n* c. 1960: Nicolas Wines: Advertisement poster, 300 x 500&nbsp;cm.\n* 1929: Les Coquillages (\"Shells\"), graphic design on fabric, (printed Tournon fabric), 31 x 28&nbsp;cm.\n* 1948: design for fabric, 49 x 64&nbsp;cm.\n\n=== Photography ===\n\nFrom the Catalogue of Latour's Works, nt., nd.\n* P. 9 : The Wigmaker's Shop Window (c. 1936).\n* P. 14: Photo journalism: Sleepers on a Bench (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;16\u201317: Passers-By (c. 1936).\n* pp.&nbsp;22\u201323: Portrait of a Fisherman and Sill Life (c. 1936).\n* P. 27: The Flying Motorcycle (c. 1932).\n\n== Main distinctions and exhibitions ==\n* 1913: Paris Salon d'Automne.

{"title_page": "Sentence spacing studies", "text_new": "'''Sentence spacing studies''' analyse the effects of [[sentence spacing]] techniques on the [[readability]] of text. The only direct [[Observational study|scientific studies]] have been conducted by researchers from the [[University of Georgia]], for on-screen text. There are currently no direct sentence spacing studies for printed text.\n\nThe direct studies, started in 2002, analysed single, double, and triple sentence spacing to determine what was most readable on screen. The researchers concluded that their tests did not show a statistically significant difference between the various techniques, but that further testing was needed.\n\n==Effects on readability and legibility==\nClaims abound regarding the [[Typography#Readability and legibility|legibility]] and [[readability]] of the single and double sentence-spacing methods\u2014by proponents on both sides. However, typographic opinions are typically anecdotal with no basis in evidence.<ref>[[#Whe95|Wheildon 1995]]. p. 13.</ref> According to [[Miles Tinker]], \"Opinions are not always safe guides to legibility of print,\"<ref>[[#Tin63|Tinker 1963]]. p. 50.</ref> and when direct studies are conducted, anecdotal opinions\u2014even those of experts\u2014can turn out to be false.<ref>[[#Tin63|Tinker 1963]]. pp. 88, 108, 127, 128, 153; [[#Whe95|Wheildon 1995]]. pp. 8, 35.</ref> For example, text that seems readable at first glance may be shown to impair reading effectiveness when subjected to [[Scientific method|scientific study]].<ref>[[#Tin63|Tinker 1963]]. pp. 50, 108, 128. A useful example is the Helvetica font, an ubiquitous font that is considered extremely legible (visually pleasing in the construction and viewing of its characters), but has been found to impair reading effectiveness (readability). See [[#Squ06|Squire 2006]]. p. 36.</ref>\n\n=== Direct studies ===\nDirect studies include those by Loh, Branch, Shewanown, & Ali (2002), Clinton, Branch, Holschuh, & Shewanown (2003) and Ni, Branch & Chen (2004) with results favouring neither single, double, nor triple spacing.<ref>[[#Leo03|Leonard et al. 2003]].</ref> The 2002 study indicated that \"the 'double space group' consistently took longer time to finish than the 'single space' group\", but the authors concluded that \"there was not enough evidence to suggest that a significant difference exists\".<ref>[[#Loh02|Loh et al., 2002]]. p. 4. This study used \"on-screen\" text in its analysis.</ref> The 2003 study analysed on-screen single, double, and triple spacing. Again, the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion.<ref>[[#Cli03|Clinton 2003.]] The study did not find \"statistically significant differences, between reading time of single and double spaces passages\".</ref> A similar study was conducted in 2009 using identical spacing variables.

The only direct [[Observational study|scientific studies]] have been conducted by researchers from the [[University of Georgia]], for on-screen text. There are currently no direct sentence spacing studies for printed text.\n\nThe direct studies, started in 2002, analysed single, double, and triple sentence spacing to determine what was most readable on screen. The researchers concluded that their tests did not show a statistically significant difference between the various techniques, but that further testing was needed.\n\n==Effects on readability and legibility==\nClaims abound regarding the [[Typography#Readability and legibility|legibility]] and [[readability]] of the single and double sentence-spacing methods\u2014by proponents on both sides.

The research in 14 studies in 1951\u20131986 correlated with the findings in the article, and six studies in 1957\u20131984 were inconclusive.</ref> \nFinally, although various studies have been conducted on the readability of proportional vs. monospaced fonts, the studies typically did not decrease sentence spacing when using proportional fonts, or did not specify whether sentence spacing was changed.<ref>[[#Pay67|Payne 1967]]. pp. 125\u2013136;

When the [[Marshall Plan]] went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]]ed for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.\n\nBefore 1974, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. [[Fiscal conservatism]] ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|56\u201360}}\n\nThe first country to receive a World Bank loan was France. The Bank's president at the time, [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]], chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250&nbsp;million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the [[United States State Department]] told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied and removed the [[Communist Party of France|Communist]] [[coalition government]] - the so-called [[Tripartite system (politics)|tripartite]]. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.<ref name=\"Bird 1992\">{{cite book |title=The Chairman: John J.

Since then, in accordance with its so-called \"Six Strategic Themes\", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.\n\nIn order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces.

Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.\n# '''Achieve Universal Primary Education''': The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72&nbsp;million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated {{as of|2005|lc=y}}.\n# '''Promote Gender Equality''': The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men- worldwide more than 60% \u2013 are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.\n# '''Reduce Child Mortality''': There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.\n# '''Improve Maternal Health''': Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.\n# '''Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases''': Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6&nbsp;million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500&nbsp;million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1&nbsp;million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n# '''Ensure Environmental Sustainability''': Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.\n# '''Develop a Global Partnership for Development''': Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.\n\nTo make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal safeguards were defined. However, these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nThe President of the Bank is the president of the entire [[World Bank Group]]. The president is responsible for chairing meetings of the Boards of Directors and for overall management of the Bank. Traditionally, the President of the Bank has always been a US citizen nominated by the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank (the managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] having always been a European). The nominee is subject to confirmation by the Board of Executive Directors, to serve for a five-year, renewable term.

It aimed to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. \nWBI had four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute (WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute. Sanjay Pradhan is the past Vice President of the World Bank Institute.<ref name=\"World Bank Institute About 2012\">{{cite web | title = About WBI | publisher = World Bank Group | author = World Bank Institute | url = http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | accessdate = 31 May 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120529155048/http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/about | archive-date = 29 May 2012 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2019, World Bank Institute functions have been mostly encapsulated by a new unit Global Operations Knowledge Management Unit (GOKMU), which is now responsible for knowledge management and learning across the Bank.\n\n===Global Development Learning Network===\nThe Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is a partnership of over 120 learning centers (GDLN Affiliates) in nearly 80 countries around the world. GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.\n\nGDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.\n\n====GDLN Asia Pacific====\nThe GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become \"the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region\". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.\n\nThe committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.\n\nThe Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a \"Foundation\". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand \u2013 Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.\n\n===JUSTPAL Network===\nA Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The JUSTPAL objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice and service delivery to citizens and businesses.\n\nThe JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies and other justice-related entities from across the globe. The Network currently has active members from more than 50 countries.\n\nTo facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, the JUSTPAL Network has organized its activities under (currently) five Communities of Practice (COPs): (i) Budgeting for the Justice Sector; (ii) Information Systems for Justice Services; (iii) Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; (iv) Court Management and Administration; and (v) Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.\n\n==Country assistance strategies==\nAs a guideline to the World Bank's operations in any particular country, a Country Assistance Strategy is produced in cooperation with the local government and any interested stakeholders and may rely on analytical work performed by the Bank or other parties.\n\n==Clean Air Initiative==\nClean Air Initiative (CAI) is a World Bank initiative to advance innovative ways to improve air quality in cities through partnerships in selected regions of the world by sharing knowledge and experiences.

While the World Bank represents 188 countries, it is run by a small number of economically powerful countries.

Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out.

Instead the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. Through his case-studies of development projects in [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] he shows that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in [[Lesotho]] was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting their projects.

Some of these policies included encouraging [[production (economics)|production]], investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real [[exchange rates]] and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|69}}\n\nBy the late 1980s, international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|70}} In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans.<ref name=\"Tan 2007\">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The poverty of amnesia: PRSPs in the legacy of structural adjustment | author = Tan, Celine | encyclopedia = The World Bank and Governance: A Decade of Reform and Reaction | editor = Stone, Diane | editor2 = Wright, Christopher | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-41282-7}}</ref>{{rp|147}} The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities.

When the [[Marshall Plan]] went into effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were [[Earmark (finance)|earmark]]ed for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the [[International Development Association]] was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.\n\nBefore 1974, the reconstruction and development loans provided by the World Bank were relatively small. The Bank's staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank. [[Fiscal conservatism]] ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict criteria.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|56\u201360}}\n\nThe first country to receive a World Bank loan was France. The Bank's president at the time, [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]], chose France over two other applicants, Poland and Chile. The loan was for US$250&nbsp;million, half the amount requested, and it came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other governments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan was approved, the [[United States State Department]] told the French government that its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be removed. The French government complied and removed the [[Communist Party of France|Communist]] [[coalition government]] - the so-called [[Tripartite system (politics)|tripartite]]. Within hours, the loan to France was approved.<ref name=\"Bird 1992\">{{cite book |title=The Chairman: John J.

His 1982 decision to replace the bank's Chief Economist, [[Hollis B. Chenery]], with [[Anne Krueger]] was an example of this new focus. Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing [[Third World]] governments as \"[[rent-seeking]] states\".\n\nDuring the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service Third-World debt, and [[structural adjustment]] policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations. [[UNICEF]] reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for \"reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], and [[Africa]]\".<ref name=\"Cornia et al. 1987\">{{Cite book | title = Adjustment with a Human Face: Protecting the Vulnerable and Promoting Growth | editor = Cornia, Giovanni Andrea | editor2 = Jolly, Richard | editor3 = Stewart, Frances | year = 1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-828609-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/adjustmentwithhu0001unse }}</ref>\n\n===1989\u2013present===\nBeginning in 1989, in response to harsh criticism from many groups, the bank began including environmental groups and NGOs in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism.<ref name=\"Goldman 2005\" />{{rp|93\u201397}} It also formed an implementing agency, in accordance with the Montreal Protocols, to stop [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depletion]] damage to the Earth's atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95% of ozone-depleting chemicals, with a target date of 2015. Since then, in accordance with its so-called \"Six Strategic Themes\", the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development. For example, in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation, especially in the Amazon, it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment.\n\nIn order to promote global public goods, the World Bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria, delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces. In 2000 the bank announced a \"war on AIDS\" and in 2011 the Bank joined the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership.<ref name=\"World Bank Results 2012\">{{cite web |title = Results|publisher = World Bank Group|author = World Bank|url = https://www.worldbank.org/results/|accessdate = 31 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, based on a tacit understanding between the United States and Europe, the [[World Bank presidential election, 2012|president of the World Bank]] has always been selected from candidates nominated by the United States.

For the goals to be realized, six criteria must be met: stronger and more inclusive growth in Africa and fragile states, more effort in health and education, integration of the development and environment agendas, more as well as better aid, movement on trade negotiations, and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the World Bank.<ref name=\"World Bank MDGs 2012\">{{cite web |title = Millennium Development Goals|publisher = World Bank Group|author = World Bank|url = https://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/|accessdate = 31 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n# '''Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger''': From 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth. Although results vary widely within regions and countries, the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty. Africa's poverty, however, is expected to rise, and most of the 36 countries where 90% of the world's undernourished children live are in Africa. Less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition.\n# '''Achieve Universal Primary Education''': The percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Still, about 72&nbsp;million children of primary school age, 57% of them girls, were not being educated {{as of|2005|lc=y}}.\n# '''Promote Gender Equality''': The tide is turning slowly for women in the labor market, yet far more women than men- worldwide more than 60% \u2013 are contributing but unpaid family workers. The World Bank Group Gender Action Plan was created to advance women's economic empowerment and promote shared growth.\n# '''Reduce Child Mortality''': There is some improvement in survival rates globally; accelerated improvements are needed most urgently in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 10 million-plus children under five died in 2005; most of their deaths were from preventable causes.\n# '''Improve Maternal Health''': Almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible.\n# '''Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases''': Annual numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS deaths have fallen, but the number of people living with HIV continues to grow. In the eight worst-hit southern African countries, prevalence is above 15 percent. Treatment has increased globally, but still meets only 30 percent of needs (with wide variations across countries). AIDS remains the leading cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa (1.6&nbsp;million deaths in 2007). There are 300 to 500&nbsp;million cases of malaria each year, leading to more than 1&nbsp;million deaths. Nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n# '''Ensure Environmental Sustainability''': Deforestation remains a critical problem, particularly in regions of biological diversity, which continues to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement.\n# '''Develop a Global Partnership for Development''': Donor countries have renewed their commitment. Donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development. Emphasis is being placed on the Bank Group's collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the MDGs' realization.\n\nTo make sure that World Bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation, environmental, social and legal safeguards were defined. However, these safeguards have not been implemented entirely yet. At the World Bank's annual meeting in Tokyo 2012 a review of these safeguards has been initiated, which was welcomed by several civil society organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Most relevant review |author=Korinna Horta |publisher=dandc.eu |date=February 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/world-bank-reviewing-its-social-and-environmental-safeguards-and-civil-society-organisations}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nThe President of the Bank is the president of the entire [[World Bank Group]]. The president is responsible for chairing meetings of the Boards of Directors and for overall management of the Bank. Traditionally, the President of the Bank has always been a US citizen nominated by the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank (the managing director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] having always been a European). The nominee is subject to confirmation by the Board of Executive Directors, to serve for a five-year, renewable term.

It aimed to inspire change agents and prepare them with essential tools that can help achieve development results. \nWBI had four major strategies to approach development problems: innovation for development, knowledge exchange, leadership and coalition building, and structured learning. World Bank Institute (WBI) was formerly known as Economic Development Institute (EDI), established on 11 March 1955 with the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The purpose of the institute was to serve as provide an open place where senior officials from developing countries could discuss development policies and programs. Over the years, EDI grew significantly and in 2000, the Institute was renamed as the World Bank Institute.

GDLN Affiliates collaborate in holding events that connect people across countries and regions for learning and dialogue on development issues.\n\nGDLN clients are typically NGOs, government, private sector and development agencies who find that they work better together on subregional, regional or global development issues using the facilities and tools offered by GDLN Affiliates. Clients also benefit from the ability of Affiliates to help them choose and apply these tools effectively, and to tap development practitioners and experts worldwide. GDLN Affiliates facilitate around 1000 videoconference-based activities a year on behalf of their clients, reaching some 90,000 people worldwide. Most of these activities bring together participants in two or more countries over a series of sessions. A majority of GDLN activities are organized by small government agencies and NGOs.\n\n====GDLN Asia Pacific====\nThe GDLN in the East Asia and Pacific region has experienced rapid growth and Distance Learning Centers now operate, or are planned in 20 countries: Australia, Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Japan, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Timor Leste, Fiji, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and New Zealand. With over 180 Distance Learning Centers, it is the largest development learning network in the Asia and Pacific region. The Secretariat Office of GDLN Asia Pacific is located in the Center of Academic Resources of Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific was launched at the GDLN's East Asia and Pacific regional meeting held in Bangkok from 22 to 24 May 2006. Its vision is to become \"the premier network exchanging ideas, experience and know-how across the Asia Pacific Region\". GDLN Asia Pacific is a separate entity to The World Bank. It has endorsed its own Charter and Business Plan and, in accordance with the Charter, a GDLN Asia Pacific Governing Committee has been appointed.\n\nThe committee comprises China (2), Australia (1), Thailand (1), The World Bank (1) and finally, a nominee of the Government of Japan (1). The organization is currently hosted by Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, founding member of the GDLN Asia Pacific.\n\nThe Governing Committee has determined that the most appropriate legal status for the GDLN AP in Thailand is a \"Foundation\". The World Bank is currently engaging a solicitor in Thailand to process all documentation in order to obtain this legal status.\n\nGDLN Asia Pacific is built on the principle of shared resources among partners engaged in a common task, and this is visible in the organizational structures that exist, as the network evolves. Physical space for its headquarters is provided by the host of the GDLN Centre in Thailand \u2013 Chulalongkorn University; Technical expertise and some infrastructure is provided by the Tokyo Development Learning Centre (TDLC); Fiduciary services are provided by Australian National University (ANU) Until the GDLN Asia Pacific is established as a legal entity tin Thailand, ANU, has offered to assist the governing committee, by providing a means of managing the inflow and outflow of funds and of reporting on them. This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.\n\n===JUSTPAL Network===\nA Justice Sector Peer-Assisted Learning (JUSTPAL) Network was launched in April 2011 by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Department of the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region. The JUSTPAL objective is to provide an online and offline platform for justice professionals to exchange knowledge, good practices and peer-driven improvements to justice systems and thereby support countries to improve their justice sector performance, quality of justice and service delivery to citizens and businesses.\n\nThe JUSTPAL Network includes representatives of judiciaries, ministries of justice, prosecutors, anti-corruption agencies and other justice-related entities from across the globe. The Network currently has active members from more than 50 countries.\n\nTo facilitate fruitful exchange of reform experiences and sharing of applicable good practices, the JUSTPAL Network has organized its activities under (currently) five Communities of Practice (COPs): (i) Budgeting for the Justice Sector; (ii) Information Systems for Justice Services; (iii) Justice Sector Physical Infrastructure; (iv) Court Management and Administration; and (v) Prosecution and Anti-Corruption Agencies.\n\n==Country assistance strategies==\nAs a guideline to the World Bank's operations in any particular country, a Country Assistance Strategy is produced in cooperation with the local government and any interested stakeholders and may rely on analytical work performed by the Bank or other parties.\n\n==Clean Air Initiative==\nClean Air Initiative (CAI) is a World Bank initiative to advance innovative ways to improve air quality in cities through partnerships in selected regions of the world by sharing knowledge and experiences.

Though the Washington Consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out.

Instead the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. Through his case-studies of development projects in [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] he shows that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in [[Lesotho]] was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting their projects.

Some of these policies included encouraging [[production (economics)|production]], investment and labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real [[exchange rates]] and altering the distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], economic growth regressed and inflation worsened. The alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans, and the circumstances of the poor often worsened, due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as subsidies were lifted.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|69}}\n\nBy the late 1980s, international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises.<ref name=\"deVries 1996\" />{{rp|70}} In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans.<ref name=\"Tan 2007\">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = The poverty of amnesia: PRSPs in the legacy of structural adjustment | author = Tan, Celine | encyclopedia = The World Bank and Governance: A Decade of Reform and Reaction | editor = Stone, Diane | editor2 = Wright, Christopher | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-41282-7}}</ref>{{rp|147}} The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities.

The terms of the PEF, which is financed by bonds sold to private investors, prevent any money from being released from the fund until 12 weeks after the outbreak was initially detected (23 March). The novel coronavirus outbreak met all other requirements for the funding to be released in January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/70dd05ac-54d8-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1|work=Financial Times|title=World Bank's pandemic bonds sink as coronavirus spreads|date=25 February 2020|access-date=4 March 2020|first=Anna|last=Gross | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>\n\nCritics have argued that the terms of the PEF are too stringent, and the 12-week delay means that the funding will be much less effective than if it was released to assist governments in initially containing the outbreak.

Later known as [[Bell Canada]], its charter granted it the right to construct telephone lines alongside all public rights-of-way in Canada. Under a licensing agreement with the US-based [[Bell Telephone Company|American Bell Telephone Company]], Bell also manufactured telephones and telephone equipment, an activity that would be spun off in a separate company that later became Northern Telecom and then [[Nortel Networks]].\n\nIn 1983, all of the Bell Canada group of companies (also known as the \"Bell Group\") were placed under a new holding company, Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. (BCE). This corporate reorganization resulted in Bell Canada and its subsidiaries, including Northern Telecom (later Nortel Networks) and over 80 others, becoming subsidiaries of the new holding company, BCE. Under the new parent, each company was owned directly by BCE, which had the benefit of freeing the manufacturing company, Nortel, and other holdings from the heavily regulated telephone company, Bell Canada. Under a variety of leaders, BCE has embarked on a series of [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversifications]], [[Consolidation (business)|consolidations]], and [[Strategic management|corporate strategies]].<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bell-canada-enterprises-inc/ Bell Canada Enterprises, The Canadian Encyclopedia].

Within a few years, it became the first Canadian company to report CAD$1 billion in profits.\n\nWhen [[Jean Monty]] assumed the job of CEO in 1998, he pursued a convergence strategy, attempting to combine both content creation and distribution within BCE, and to take greater advantage of the emerging Internet market. BCE's acquisition in 2000 (and subsequent financing) of overseas carrier [[Teleglobe]] cost billions of dollars.

Later known as [[Bell Canada]], its charter granted it the right to construct telephone lines alongside all public rights-of-way in Canada. Under a licensing agreement with the US-based [[Bell Telephone Company|American Bell Telephone Company]], Bell also manufactured telephones and telephone equipment, an activity that would be spun off in a separate company that later became Northern Telecom and then [[Nortel Networks]].\n\nIn 1983, all of the Bell Canada group of companies (also known as the \"Bell Group\") were placed under a new holding company, Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. (BCE). This corporate reorganization resulted in Bell Canada and its subsidiaries, including Northern Telecom (later Nortel Networks) and over 80 others, becoming subsidiaries of the new holding company, BCE. Under the new parent, each company was owned directly by BCE, which had the benefit of freeing the manufacturing company, Nortel, and other holdings from the heavily regulated telephone company, Bell Canada. Under a variety of leaders, BCE has embarked on a series of [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversifications]], [[Consolidation (business)|consolidations]], and [[Strategic management|corporate strategies]].<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bell-canada-enterprises-inc/ Bell Canada Enterprises, The Canadian Encyclopedia].

When interest rates soared, however, Daon was caught overextended, could not meet its debt payments, and was forced into a major restructuring with its bankers. In 1985, BCE acquired 68% of Daon from its creditors and changed its name to BCE Development Corporation in February 1986. In March 1986, it agreed to acquire US$1 billion of commercial real estate from the American subsidiary of the Oxford Development Group Ltd., more than doubling BCED's portfolio. BCE stated its goal was to convert from a land developer to a developer of prime commercial properties.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/14/business/business-people-chairman-rebuilding-former-daon-corp.html ''Chairman rebuilding former Daon Corp.'', NY Times, March 14, 1986].
