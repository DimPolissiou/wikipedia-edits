With its emphasis on [[American Mafia]] insinuations and [[organized crime]], the album is widely regarded as a pioneer of the [[mafioso rap]] subgenre. It is considered to have been highly influential on hip hop music over the next decade, being heavily referenced and influential on acclaimed albums such as [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1996) and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s ''[[Life After Death]]'' (1997).

Retrieved 2012-04-24.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[Raekwon]] released ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' as his first solo album, and the third seen from the Wu after the release of their debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', with [[Method Man]]'s ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'' and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s ''[[Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version]]'' released prior. The song \"[[Can It Be All So Simple]],\" from ''36 Chambers'', marked the first recorded exhibition of Raekwon and Ghostface Killah as a duo, as the two would further establish this alliance on ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...''. Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=XXL/> In an interview with ''[[Wax Poetics]]'', Raekwon explained \"I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit I knew and saw. We did the hustlin' thing, we did the crime thing; we did all the things that made us feel like mobsters or Mafiosos in some way.\"<ref name=WP1/> In a different article, Ghostface Killah recollected \"Back then I was punchin' a lot of rap niggas in their face, and niggas was getting beat up in the clubs. We were banned from everything. They wouldn't even let me in the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]]. Niggas was scared to death when I was out there wilding. I was fucking niggas up, robbing niggas, fucking a lot of bitches, just doing dumb shit.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nIn regard to his and Ghostface's partnership, Raekwon later commented \"Ghost and me, especially at the time, had this identical-twin effect on each other. We would joke about the same things and laugh at the same shit. We were into the same clothes and shit. We were like the [[EPMD]] of the crew.\"<ref name=WP1/> Producer [[RZA]] also commented on the duo's congruency:\n\n{{quote|Rae and Ghost together, those two right there were notorious kids from two different [[Public housing in the United States|projects]]. ''Cuban Linx'' was an opportunity for Rae and Ghost to give us the street side. When we did it, I said, \"yo, it's gonna be a very dangerous album; it's gonna change the game. We gonna invite those demons, every negative stereotype, and deal with them.\" It's like the shit was lived; a lot of it was lived or experienced in one form or another. It's so natural, it don't feel like songs. It was a chance to show the world not only how New York lived, but also how [[Staten Island|Shaolin]] preserved New York. An older generation was leaving and getting older. We're from the [[Crack epidemic (United States)|crack generation]] - that real gritty, rough project shit. We was on corners at 15, 16, doing shit you couldn't imagine.<ref name=XXL>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=41&threadid=39731|title=The Making of 'Only Built 4 Cuban Linx'|author=Arnold, Paul W.|magazine=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 2005|accessdate=2009-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref>|RZA}}\n\n''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' features a wide array of Wu-Tang members, as well as Wu-Tang affiliates [[Cappadonna]], and [[Blue Raspberry (singer)|Blue Raspberry]]. It also features a guest appearance from rapper [[Nas]], making this the first collaboration with a non-affiliated artist on a Wu-Tang related album. Regarding this event, Nas later recalled \"Rae would come out to [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]], I would go to [[Staten Island]]. We'd just ride and hang out all night. We didn't call each other to work. We called each other to hang out. Somehow we wound up in the studio. RZA had a couple of beats. He played them for me. I got on both of them. The other one never came out. I was honored to be asked to be on the album. Raekwon was ahead of his time. I knew Rae was a classic artist and the album was going to be a music classic.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Title significance ===\nThe album's title serves as \"a warning of its musical potency to those not prepared for the uncut raw contained within.\"<ref name=XXL/> Although the original intended title was \"''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx Niggaz''\", this idea was eventually dismissed in favor of a more market-friendly one.<ref name=XXL/> Ghostface Killah later specified \"We already had the title. The [[Jewellery chain|chain]] we used to rock back in the days was Cuban links. So Rae came up with the theory, like a Cuban link is one of the roughest chains to break. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Real niggas, strong niggas.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nThe album is also commonly referred to as \"''The Purple Tape''\" because the original cassette's plastic was entirely purple; Raekwon marked the tape distinctively as a reference to drug dealers' method of tagging their product, to distinguish it from that of others'.<ref name=XXL/> \"I wanted to portray an image that if I was selling crack or dimes in the street, you would recognize these dimes from other niggas' dimes.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n[[File:RZA 2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[RZA]] produced the entire album in his basement studio, as he did with solo releases by other members.]]\nRecording sessions began in late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio that many of the group's earlier albums were recorded in.<ref name=XXL/> In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted \"They had wanted to go to [[Barbados]]. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No [[Audio engineering|engineer]], no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was ''Linx'' and ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took three and a half years of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it.\"<ref name=XXL/> Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated \"The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nSeeking to musically express Raekwon's blend of [[Five Percenter]] creed and inner-city experience, producer RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered than that of Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from [[Martial arts film|Kung Fu movies]], and [[Mafia film]]s. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' to play like scenes in a crime movie.<ref name=XXL/> RZA has cited [[soul music|soul]] musician [[Isaac Hayes]] as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks.<ref name=XXL/> He also later revealed that several of the album's beats, such as \"Incarcerated Scarfaces,\" were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's ''Liquid Swords'' album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for ''Cuban Linx''.<ref name=XXL/> In regard to this, Raekwon clarified \"RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. You come in and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like a grab bag. If I came in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not.\"<ref name=WP1/>\n\nThroughout the album, producer RZA [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] dialogue from various scenes in the [[John Woo]] film ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''. RZA later recollected \"I met John Woo that same year. He sent me a letter. He was honored that we did it. I felt confident we could settle anything that came up. You can usually settle that shit. It's part of the budget, man. But John Woo didn't want nothing, never no money for that. We actually became friends. He took me and Ghost to lunch and dinner many times. He gave me a lot of mentoring in film.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Gambinos ===\nThe song \"Wu-Gambinos\" was one of the first songs recorded for the album, and marked the beginning of the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] aliases used for the members who appeared on the album,<ref name=XXL/> and would eventually become highly influential on hip hop.<ref name=XXL/> Raekwon later explained \"The Wu-Gambinos aliases come from how I used to like that movie ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', with Robert De Niro and James Woods. I liked how these young little niggas grew up, from the ground up, not having nothing to start. And the names came. You know, \"Tony Starks\" came from [[Iron Man]]. \"Lou Diamond\" came from [[Louis Roederer]] who made [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]], and from me being infatuated with the diamond world. Back then I was wearing a lot of [[Jewellery chain|ice]], was calling shit ice. But then I started giving some of my niggas in the crew names. Being that it's my album, I wanted niggas to know, you gotta have a certain [[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] when you're on this track. This is a Gambino track. Wu-Gambinos. I would call [[Masta Killa]] \"Noodles,\" call [[GZA]] \"Maximillian.\" Inside the movie (''Once Upon a Time in America''), Noodles and Max was partners. I felt like GZA was like Maximillian because he was like the brains of the crew. He would say something real intellectual and smart. I called [[Inspectah Deck|Deck]] \"Rollie Fingers\" cause of the way he roll [[Cannabis smoking#Blunt|blunts]]. So names just started fitting niggas.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{Quote box\n |quote = A lushly impenetrable jungle of sonic allusions transforms the nightmare of the [[crack epidemic|crack era]] into a dream of [[Cream skimming|cream skimmed]] and warmed for the bathtub\u2014a dream with its own [[internal logic]], moral weight, and commitment to beauty.

In an article for ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', RZA later illustrated \"The theme of the album is two guys that had enough of the negative life and was ready to move on, but had one more sting to pull off. They're tired of doing what they doing, but they're trying to make this last quarter million. That's a lot of money in the streets. We gonna retire and see our grandbabies and get our lives together.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nIn keeping with this loose storyline, the album opens with the introduction track \"Striving For Perfection,\" in which Raekwon and \"co-star\" Ghostface converse about visions and goals.<ref name=XXL/> On the proceeding track \"Knuckleheadz,\" Raekwon and Ghostface divide money in the song's intro, and then engage in a [[robbery|heist]], with [[U-God]]'s character being killed off at the end of his verse.<ref name=XXL/> The reason for this elimination is because U-God was sentenced to serve several months in prison, which prevented subsequent participation on ''Cuban Linx''.<ref name=XXL/> U-God, however, recruited his lyric mentor and childhood friend [[Cappadonna]] to take his place later in the album.<ref name=XXL/>\n\n{{Listen|pos = left\n |filename    = Verbal Intercourse.ogg\n |title       = \"Verbal Intercourse\"\n |description = The much-revered collaboration between Raekwon and Nas portrays prophetic and criminal imagery.<ref name=\"RapReviews\"/><ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n}}\n''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' features dialogue-driven interludes in the beginning of several tracks with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah conversing about money, life, crime, and hip hop, among other things. The introduction to \"Glaciers of Ice,\" for instance, involves Ghostface addressing his plans and methods of [[dye]]ing Wallabee-styled [[C&J Clark|Clarks]].<ref name=XXL/> In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained \"We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and we just started talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks.

Other than that, I'm boss.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nThe album ends with the song \"North Star,\" which serves as a \"[[closing credits]]\" type of song. In regard to this track and [[Popa Wu]]'s inclusion, RZA later remarked \"The idea is Rae did everything he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard|ODB]]. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you the only person I know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.' It's very poisonous unless they got proper guidance. He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life.\"<ref name=XXL/> Raekwon further commented \"'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album.

The first of which was \"[[Heaven & Hell (Raekwon song)|Heaven & Hell]],\" released October 24, 1994.

Ghost actually asked me to make one of those beats. You listen to old DJ tapes. That's how I made that song, and he wanted this shit to sound like a breakbeat. He had a rhyme that he knew was going to change the game - that was the verse that got him recognized. [[Cypress Hill]]'s [[DJ Muggs]] called up and was like \"Yo, he killed that shit.

This proved to be the most successful single off the album, as it reached the 37th spot on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and the fifth spot on the Hot Rap Singles chart.<ref name=singles/> The song uses different flavor variants of ice cream as a metaphor for different races of women.

In regard to his guest spot, Cappadonna later recalled \"I had heard Rae's and Ghost's verses on there. And I had made a joke about me getting on the track, and RZA took it seriously and was like \"Yo, go ahead.

In regard to the song's lyrics, Raekwon summarized \"this is for the struggling girl who can't understand her man and he a thorough nigga. We wanted to put a girl from the movie ''The Killer'' in the skit, at the start of the song, when she said 'I sing for him and he isn't here.' He ain't here, cause he makin' money!

''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine's Nicholas Poluhoff said \"Raekwon has always brought his own special flavor to the Wu cipher: he sprays out lyrics like gunfire, forming vivid tales.

Huey argued the record was possibly the \"best Wu-Tang solo album\", along with GZA's ''[[Liquid Swords]]'', and wrote that like that album, \"''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx'' takes a few listens to reveal the full scope of its lyrical complexities, but it's immensely rewarding in the end.\"<ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n\n=== Gambinos ===\n''OB4CL'' popularized street-related, [[Mafioso rap]] on the [[East Coast hip hop|east coast]].<ref name=XXL/> While this style was originated by [[Kool G Rap]] in the late 1980s, it didn't completely permeate the hip hop world until the release of ''OB4CL'' in 1995.<ref name=XXL/> References to ''Cuban Linx'' could be heard heavily in following years with several notable changes in hip hop culture. For instance, the album refers to \"Wu-Gambinos\" in various occurrences; the term being a name for the 'alter-egos' of the rappers involved in ''Cuban Linx'', and used on various later projects. These alter-egos inspired an already [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative]] hip-hop world to adopt new names and personae, from Nas' Escobar moniker to [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s Frank White counterpart, which he would go on to further utilize upon the release of ''OB4CL''. A known fan of the Wu, [[Tupac Shakur]] began to refer to himself as Makaveli and gave his [[Outlawz]] crew new names, albeit with a militaristic, dictatorial theme. In regard to Raekwon's innovation of the gambinos, [[Method Man]] later affirmed \"Raekwon started that. Rae always had that mobster mentality, always liked to watch gangster movies and read mob books and stuff like that, you know? So he pretty much knew the names of the cats and what they was about. He polished his whole style like that.\"<ref name=XXL/> Ghostface Killah also touched base on the gambino influence stating \"We done took that to the highest peak. We bonded as a tight family, so niggas is starting to try and do that right now. Everybody thinking they have a strong family. We opened up the door for a lot of niggas. The shit was just crazy on how it came together.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Cristal ===\nAnother exemplification of ''Cuban Linx'''s influence is in the spike in popularity of [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]], an expensive champagne, which was mentioned on the album and touted by Rae and Ghost. It has now become a staple in hip hop, with name-drops that continue to this day.<ref name=XXL/> The brand even made its way into popular culture when director [[Quentin Tarantino]], a known affiliate of RZA and the Wu-Tang Clan, goes on a rant about the champagne's quality in his segment of ''[[Four Rooms]]'', a film released in the months after Raekwon's album.\n\nIn regard to this trend, Raekwon later clarified \"We was the first to be talking that Cristal shit. I know that for a fact. Back then we would go do dinners and sit with [[Loud Records]] president [[Steve Rifkind]] and them up at the label. And our mission would be like, when we sit at the table, we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some [[Mo\u00ebt et Chandon|Mo]] or something and they didn't have it. So we was like \"What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?\" And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name on the bottle was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Hip hop albums ===\nIronically enough, despite Raekwon and Ghost's warning on \"Shark Niggas (Biters)\" to \"be original\", ''OB4CL's'' influence spawned a countless number of albums with many of the adopted principles that it set in place. The year following its release, in 1996, [[Jay-Z]] released his debut album ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'', which describes a lavish, Cristal-drinking mobster persona and deals with the subjects of street crime and getting out of drug-dealing and into the rap game, much like the topics covered on ''OB4CL''.<ref name=XXL/> Jay-Z would later reference ''Cuban Linx'' in his 2009 song \"[[The Blueprint 3|A Star Is Born]]\" by stating \"Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate / Rae took on a date with the ''Purple Tape'' / passed it on to Ason, then Ghostface / they had a hell of a run, [[Standing ovation|stand and ovate]].\" Raekwon later commented in an interview \"Jay was a student of our shit and what we accomplished in those days. He'll tell you that himself.\"<ref name=WP1/>\n\nThe same year, highly acclaimed rapper Nas released ''[[It Was Written]]'', revising his image to incorporate the Mafia posturing of Raekwon; adopting the Mafioso moniker \"Nas Escobar\" bestowed upon him by his guest appearance on ''Cuban Linx''. 1996 also saw the releases of Ghostface Killah's debut album ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'', which loosely covers some of the topics on ''Cuban Linx'', and also [[Mobb Deep]]'s second major-label album, ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'', which showcased the duo's interpretation of the ''Cuban Linx'' demeanor, and featured contributions from Raekwon, Method Man, and Nas. In 1997, The Notorious B.I.G. revamped his image into that of a gun-toting, big-money making, mob-commanding kingpin, most notably on the songs \"Niggas Bleed\", \"What's Beef\", \"My Downfall\", and \"I Love the Dough\" featuring Jay-Z (previously mentioned); Nas, then with [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]], put out a similarly minded album that year in ''[[The Album (The Firm album)|The Firm: The Album]]''.\n\nThe influence of ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' continued through into the 2000s with other albums, such as [[Rick Ross]]' ''[[Deeper Than Rap]]'' and Jay-Z's ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]'', continuing to find success following the album's overall structure and premise. Though ''Cuban Linx'' would prove to be highly influential, Raekwon later revealed that he had no intentions for this impact, stating \"Really, I was just trying to make something worth purchasing and worth respecting.\"<ref name=WP1/>\n\n=== Sequel ===\nAfter two solo projects that were both critically and commercially unsuccessful, Raekwon announced a sequel to ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' in late 2005. The sequel was highly anticipated for nearly four years since its original announcement and fourteen years after the release of the original, appearing in ''XXL''{{'}}s top 10 list of most anticipated albums in 2007.<ref>[http://xxlmag.com/online/?p=7288 Remedy: ''The Top 10 Most Anticipated Albums of 2007''].

With its emphasis on [[American Mafia]] insinuations and [[organized crime]], the album is widely regarded as a pioneer of the [[mafioso rap]] subgenre. It is considered to have been highly influential on hip hop music over the next decade, being heavily referenced and influential on acclaimed albums such as [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1996) and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]'s ''[[Life After Death]]'' (1997).

Retrieved 2012-04-24.</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[Raekwon]] released ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' as his first solo album, and the third seen from the Wu after the release of their debut album ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', with [[Method Man]]'s ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]'' and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s ''[[Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version]]'' released prior. The song \"[[Can It Be All So Simple]],\" from ''36 Chambers'', marked the first recorded exhibition of Raekwon and Ghostface Killah as a duo, as the two would further establish this alliance on ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...''. Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=XXL/> In an interview with ''[[Wax Poetics]]'', Raekwon explained \"I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit I knew and saw. We did the hustlin' thing, we did the crime thing; we did all the things that made us feel like mobsters or Mafiosos in some way.\"<ref name=WP1/> In a different article, Ghostface Killah recollected \"Back then I was punchin' a lot of rap niggas in their face, and niggas was getting beat up in the clubs. We were banned from everything. They wouldn't even let me in the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]]. Niggas was scared to death when I was out there wilding. I was fucking niggas up, robbing niggas, fucking a lot of bitches, just doing dumb shit.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nIn regard to his and Ghostface's partnership, Raekwon later commented \"Ghost and me, especially at the time, had this identical-twin effect on each other. We would joke about the same things and laugh at the same shit. We were into the same clothes and shit. We were like the [[EPMD]] of the crew.\"<ref name=WP1/> Producer [[RZA]] also commented on the duo's congruency:\n\n{{quote|Rae and Ghost together, those two right there were notorious kids from two different [[Public housing in the United States|projects]]. ''Cuban Linx'' was an opportunity for Rae and Ghost to give us the street side. When we did it, I said, \"yo, it's gonna be a very dangerous album; it's gonna change the game. We gonna invite those demons, every negative stereotype, and deal with them.\" It's like the shit was lived; a lot of it was lived or experienced in one form or another. It's so natural, it don't feel like songs. It was a chance to show the world not only how New York lived, but also how [[Staten Island|Shaolin]] preserved New York. An older generation was leaving and getting older. We're from the [[Crack epidemic (United States)|crack generation]] - that real gritty, rough project shit. We was on corners at 15, 16, doing shit you couldn't imagine.<ref name=XXL>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=41&threadid=39731|title=The Making of 'Only Built 4 Cuban Linx'|author=Arnold, Paul W.|magazine=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 2005|accessdate=2009-12-31|display-authors=etal}}</ref>|RZA}}\n\n''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' features a wide array of Wu-Tang members, as well as Wu-Tang affiliates [[Cappadonna]], and [[Blue Raspberry (singer)|Blue Raspberry]]. It also features a guest appearance from rapper [[Nas]], making this the first collaboration with a non-affiliated artist on a Wu-Tang related album. Regarding this event, Nas later recalled \"Rae would come out to [[Queensbridge, Queens|Queensbridge]], I would go to [[Staten Island]]. We'd just ride and hang out all night. We didn't call each other to work. We called each other to hang out. Somehow we wound up in the studio. RZA had a couple of beats. He played them for me. I got on both of them. The other one never came out. I was honored to be asked to be on the album. Raekwon was ahead of his time. I knew Rae was a classic artist and the album was going to be a music classic.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Title significance ===\nThe album's title serves as \"a warning of its musical potency to those not prepared for the uncut raw contained within.\"<ref name=XXL/> Although the original intended title was \"''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx Niggaz''\", this idea was eventually dismissed in favor of a more market-friendly one.<ref name=XXL/> Ghostface Killah later specified \"We already had the title. The [[Jewellery chain|chain]] we used to rock back in the days was Cuban links. So Rae came up with the theory, like a Cuban link is one of the roughest chains to break. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Real niggas, strong niggas.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nThe album is also commonly referred to as \"''The Purple Tape''\" because the original cassette's plastic was entirely purple; Raekwon marked the tape distinctively as a reference to drug dealers' method of tagging their product, to distinguish it from that of others'.<ref name=XXL/> \"I wanted to portray an image that if I was selling crack or dimes in the street, you would recognize these dimes from other niggas' dimes.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n[[File:RZA 2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[RZA]] produced the entire album in his basement studio, as he did with solo releases by other members.]]\nRecording sessions began in late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio that many of the group's earlier albums were recorded in.<ref name=XXL/> In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted \"They had wanted to go to [[Barbados]]. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No [[Audio engineering|engineer]], no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was ''Linx'' and ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took three and a half years of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it.\"<ref name=XXL/> Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated \"The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nSeeking to musically express Raekwon's blend of [[Five Percenter]] creed and inner-city experience, producer RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered than that of Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from [[Martial arts film|Kung Fu movies]], and [[Mafia film]]s. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' to play like scenes in a crime movie.<ref name=XXL/> RZA has cited [[soul music|soul]] musician [[Isaac Hayes]] as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks.<ref name=XXL/> He also later revealed that several of the album's beats, such as \"Incarcerated Scarfaces,\" were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's ''Liquid Swords'' album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for ''Cuban Linx''.<ref name=XXL/> In regard to this, Raekwon clarified \"RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. You come in and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like a grab bag. If I came in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not.\"<ref name=WP1/>\n\nThroughout the album, producer RZA [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] dialogue from various scenes in the [[John Woo]] film ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''. RZA later recollected \"I met John Woo that same year. He sent me a letter. He was honored that we did it. I felt confident we could settle anything that came up. You can usually settle that shit. It's part of the budget, man. But John Woo didn't want nothing, never no money for that. We actually became friends. He took me and Ghost to lunch and dinner many times. He gave me a lot of mentoring in film.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Gambinos ===\nThe song \"Wu-Gambinos\" was one of the first songs recorded for the album, and marked the beginning of the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] aliases used for the members who appeared on the album,<ref name=XXL/> and would eventually become highly influential on hip hop.<ref name=XXL/> Raekwon later explained \"The Wu-Gambinos aliases come from how I used to like that movie ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', with Robert De Niro and James Woods. I liked how these young little niggas grew up, from the ground up, not having nothing to start. And the names came. You know, \"Tony Starks\" came from [[Iron Man]]. \"Lou Diamond\" came from [[Louis Roederer]] who made [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]], and from me being infatuated with the diamond world. Back then I was wearing a lot of [[Jewellery chain|ice]], was calling shit ice. But then I started giving some of my niggas in the crew names. Being that it's my album, I wanted niggas to know, you gotta have a certain [[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] when you're on this track. This is a Gambino track. Wu-Gambinos. I would call [[Masta Killa]] \"Noodles,\" call [[GZA]] \"Maximillian.\" Inside the movie (''Once Upon a Time in America''), Noodles and Max was partners. I felt like GZA was like Maximillian because he was like the brains of the crew. He would say something real intellectual and smart. I called [[Inspectah Deck|Deck]] \"Rollie Fingers\" cause of the way he roll [[Cannabis smoking#Blunt|blunts]].

In an article for ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', RZA later illustrated \"The theme of the album is two guys that had enough of the negative life and was ready to move on, but had one more sting to pull off. They're tired of doing what they doing, but they're trying to make this last quarter million. That's a lot of money in the streets. We gonna retire and see our grandbabies and get our lives together.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nIn keeping with this loose storyline, the album opens with the introduction track \"Striving For Perfection,\" in which Raekwon and \"co-star\" Ghostface converse about visions and goals.<ref name=XXL/> On the proceeding track \"Knuckleheadz,\" Raekwon and Ghostface divide money in the song's intro, and then engage in a [[robbery|heist]], with [[U-God]]'s character being killed off at the end of his verse.<ref name=XXL/> The reason for this elimination is because U-God was sentenced to serve several months in prison, which prevented subsequent participation on ''Cuban Linx''.<ref name=XXL/> U-God, however, recruited his lyric mentor and childhood friend [[Cappadonna]] to take his place later in the album.<ref name=XXL/>\n\n{{Listen|pos = left\n |filename    = Verbal Intercourse.ogg\n |title       = \"Verbal Intercourse\"\n |description = The much-revered collaboration between Raekwon and Nas portrays prophetic and criminal imagery.<ref name=\"RapReviews\"/><ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n}}\n''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' features dialogue-driven interludes in the beginning of several tracks with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah conversing about money, life, crime, and hip hop, among other things. The introduction to \"Glaciers of Ice,\" for instance, involves Ghostface addressing his plans and methods of [[dye]]ing Wallabee-styled [[C&J Clark|Clarks]].<ref name=XXL/> In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained \"We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and we just started talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks.

Other than that, I'm boss.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\nThe album ends with the song \"North Star,\" which serves as a \"[[closing credits]]\" type of song. In regard to this track and [[Popa Wu]]'s inclusion, RZA later remarked \"The idea is Rae did everything he had to do. Everything is over now. The job is over. Mission is over, it's a perfect closing to the album. Popa Wu was a very smart mentor in the younger days to me and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard|ODB]]. Everybody had dibs and dabs of knowledge of self, I brought him in to be a mentor to these men like, 'I love them and you the only person I know that have the intelligence to keep them in sync with knowledge.'

He was the smartest man I'd ever met at a certain time in my life.\"<ref name=XXL/> Raekwon further commented \"'North Star' was a track I really, really wanted on my album.

Huey argued the record was possibly the \"best Wu-Tang solo album\", along with GZA's ''[[Liquid Swords]]'', and wrote that like that album, \"''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx'' takes a few listens to reveal the full scope of its lyrical complexities, but it's immensely rewarding in the end.\"<ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n\n=== Gambinos ===\n''OB4CL'' popularized street-related, [[Mafioso rap]] on the [[East Coast hip hop|east coast]].<ref name=XXL/> While this style was originated by [[Kool G Rap]] in the late 1980s, it didn't completely permeate the hip hop world until the release of ''OB4CL'' in 1995.<ref name=XXL/> References to ''Cuban Linx'' could be heard heavily in following years with several notable changes in hip hop culture. For instance, the album refers to \"Wu-Gambinos\" in various occurrences; the term being a name for the 'alter-egos' of the rappers involved in ''Cuban Linx'', and used on various later projects. These alter-egos inspired an already [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative]] hip-hop world to adopt new names and personae, from Nas' Escobar moniker to [[Notorious B.I.G.]]'s Frank White counterpart, which he would go on to further utilize upon the release of ''OB4CL''. A known fan of the Wu, [[Tupac Shakur]] began to refer to himself as Makaveli and gave his [[Outlawz]] crew new names, albeit with a militaristic, dictatorial theme. In regard to Raekwon's innovation of the gambinos, [[Method Man]] later affirmed \"Raekwon started that. Rae always had that mobster mentality, always liked to watch gangster movies and read mob books and stuff like that, you know? So he pretty much knew the names of the cats and what they was about. He polished his whole style like that.\"<ref name=XXL/> Ghostface Killah also touched base on the gambino influence stating \"We done took that to the highest peak. We bonded as a tight family, so niggas is starting to try and do that right now. Everybody thinking they have a strong family. We opened up the door for a lot of niggas. The shit was just crazy on how it came together.\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Cristal ===\nAnother exemplification of ''Cuban Linx'''s influence is in the spike in popularity of [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]], an expensive champagne, which was mentioned on the album and touted by Rae and Ghost. It has now become a staple in hip hop, with name-drops that continue to this day.<ref name=XXL/> The brand even made its way into popular culture when director [[Quentin Tarantino]], a known affiliate of RZA and the Wu-Tang Clan, goes on a rant about the champagne's quality in his segment of ''[[Four Rooms]]'', a film released in the months after Raekwon's album.\n\nIn regard to this trend, Raekwon later clarified \"We was the first to be talking that Cristal shit. I know that for a fact. Back then we would go do dinners and sit with [[Loud Records]] president [[Steve Rifkind]] and them up at the label. And our mission would be like, when we sit at the table, we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some [[Mo\u00ebt et Chandon|Mo]] or something and they didn't have it. So we was like \"What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?\" And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name on the bottle was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!\"<ref name=XXL/>\n\n=== Hip hop albums ===\nIronically enough, despite Raekwon and Ghost's warning on \"Shark Niggas (Biters)\" to \"be original\", ''OB4CL's'' influence spawned a countless number of albums with many of the adopted principles that it set in place. The year following its release, in 1996, [[Jay-Z]] released his debut album ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'', which describes a lavish, Cristal-drinking mobster persona and deals with the subjects of street crime and getting out of drug-dealing and into the rap game, much like the topics covered on ''OB4CL''.<ref name=XXL/> Jay-Z would later reference ''Cuban Linx'' in his 2009 song \"[[The Blueprint 3|A Star Is Born]]\" by stating \"Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate / Rae took on a date with the ''Purple Tape'' / passed it on to Ason, then Ghostface / they had a hell of a run, [[Standing ovation|stand and ovate]].\" Raekwon later commented in an interview \"Jay was a student of our shit and what we accomplished in those days. He'll tell you that himself.\"<ref name=WP1/>\n\nThe same year, highly acclaimed rapper Nas released ''[[It Was Written]]'', revising his image to incorporate the Mafia posturing of Raekwon; adopting the Mafioso moniker \"Nas Escobar\" bestowed upon him by his guest appearance on ''Cuban Linx''. 1996 also saw the releases of Ghostface Killah's debut album ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'', which loosely covers some of the topics on ''Cuban Linx'', and also [[Mobb Deep]]'s second major-label album, ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'', which showcased the duo's interpretation of the ''Cuban Linx'' demeanor, and featured contributions from Raekwon, Method Man, and Nas. In 1997, The Notorious B.I.G. revamped his image into that of a gun-toting, big-money making, mob-commanding kingpin, most notably on the songs \"Niggas Bleed\", \"What's Beef\", \"My Downfall\", and \"I Love the Dough\" featuring Jay-Z (previously mentioned); Nas, then with [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]], put out a similarly minded album that year in ''[[The Album (The Firm album)|The Firm: The Album]]''.\n\nThe influence of ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' continued through into the 2000s with other albums, such as [[Rick Ross]]' ''[[Deeper Than Rap]]'' and Jay-Z's ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]'', continuing to find success following the album's overall structure and premise. Though ''Cuban Linx'' would prove to be highly influential, Raekwon later revealed that he had no intentions for this impact, stating \"Really, I was just trying to make something worth purchasing and worth respecting.\"<ref name=WP1/>\n\n=== Sequel ===\nAfter two solo projects that were both critically and commercially unsuccessful, Raekwon announced a sequel to ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' in late 2005. The sequel was highly anticipated for nearly four years since its original announcement and fourteen years after the release of the original, appearing in ''XXL''{{'}}s top 10 list of most anticipated albums in 2007.<ref>[http://xxlmag.com/online/?p=7288 Remedy: ''The Top 10 Most Anticipated Albums of 2007''].

The season premiered on June 25, 2019 and concluded on September 25, 2019. The 40-episode season was broadcast on [[CBS]] in the United States and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. The show chronicles a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, as they compete to be the last competitor remaining to win a grand prize of [[USD|$]]500,000. Over the course of the season the HouseGuests participated in a series of competitions to win power and safety to avoid being eliminated, referred to as \"evicted\". In the finale episode, previous nine evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury, voted on who they thought should win the game out of the last two HouseGuests remaining. The HouseGuest who received the most votes would be declared the winner. Prior to the live finale a public vote is held to determine who would win the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. Jackson Michie was declared the winner of the season in a 6\u20133 jury vote over Holly Allen while Nicole Anthony won the public vote for America's Favorite HouseGuest. CBS confirmed on September 5, 2019 that the series was renewed for a twenty-second season.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Format ==\n{{Further|Big Brother (U.S.)#Format}}\n''Big Brother'' depicts a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live inside a custom-built two story house outfitted with 94 HD cameras and over 113 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees. The Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote.  This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

Following the move-in, the HouseGuests joined each other in the living room for formal introductions over champagne. As the HouseGuests began to settle in to the House, Julie informed them that they would vote for a Camp Director, who would be safe from the first eviction and have unprecedented power in the game.

The HouseGuests were told that the Camp Director would receive Immunity for the first week but would have to put the games of other HouseGuests in jeopardy. Michie was elected as Camp Director. He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game. After Cliff's eviction, the Comeback HouseGuests competed to re-enter the game. Cliff won the competition, while David, Ovi and Kemi were all evicted.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} Analyse, Christie and Michie were selected by the viewers to participate in the ''America's Field Trip'' competition. Michie won and was immune for the week. For finishing last, Christie was nominated as a third nominee (denoted in '''bold'''). Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following Jessica's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: During the finale, the Jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Big Brother 21'' was criticized negatively by critics and fans due to the HouseGuests' discriminatory tendencies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dehnart |first1=Andy |title=Big Brother 21 racism and awfulness: an update |url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/07/big-brother-21-racism-update-bb21/ |website=realityblurred.com |publisher=Reality Blurred |accessdate=25 October 2019 |date=25 July 2019}}</ref> Professor of African American studies and the UCLA Dean of Social Sciences, Darnell Hunt, stated, \"Race is the central axis of social relationships.

The season premiered on June 25, 2019 and concluded on September 25, 2019. The 40-episode season was broadcast on [[CBS]] in the United States and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. The show chronicles a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, as they compete to be the last competitor remaining to win a grand prize of [[USD|$]]500,000. Over the course of the season the HouseGuests participated in a series of competitions to win power and safety to avoid being eliminated, referred to as \"evicted\". In the finale episode, previous nine evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury, voted on who they thought should win the game out of the last two HouseGuests remaining. The HouseGuest who received the most votes would be declared the winner. Prior to the live finale a public vote is held to determine who would win the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. Jackson Michie was declared the winner of the season in a 6\u20133 jury vote over Holly Allen while Nicole Anthony won the public vote for America's Favorite HouseGuest. CBS confirmed on September 5, 2019 that the series was renewed for a twenty-second season.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Format ==\n{{Further|Big Brother (U.S.)#Format}}\n''Big Brother'' depicts a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live inside a custom-built two story house outfitted with 94 HD cameras and over 113 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees. The Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote.  This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced.

America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week.

In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).\n\nSince the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, [[design engineer]]s can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].\n\nEmbedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[MP3 player]]s, to large stationary installations like [[Traffic light control and coordination|traffic light controllers]], [[programmable logic controller]]s, and large complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[medical imaging]] systems, and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[equipment rack]].\n\n==History==\n=== Background ===\n{{See also|Microprocessor chronology}}\n\nThe origins of the [[microprocessor]] and the [[microcontroller]] can be traced back to the [[MOS integrated circuit]], which is an [[integrated circuit]] chip [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] from [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]s) and was developed in the early 1960s. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher [[transistor density]] and lower manufacturing costs than [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] chips. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by [[Moore's law]], leading to [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) with hundreds of [[transistors]] on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to [[computing]] was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete [[computer processor]] system could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=48\u201354 |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |accessdate=13 October 2019|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7551353 }}</ref>\n\nThe first multi-chip microprocessors, the [[Four-Phase Systems AL1]] in 1969 and the [[Garrett AiResearch]] [[MP944]] in 1970, were developed with multiple MOS LSI chips. The first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]], released in 1971. It was developed by [[Federico Faggin]], using his [[silicon-gate]] MOS technology, along with [[Intel]] engineers [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Stan Mazor]], and [[Busicom]] engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |website=The Silicon Engine |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Development ===\nOne of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{citation needed|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s to reduce the size and weight. \n\nAn early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.\n\nSince these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]], the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[Analogue electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.\n\nToday, a comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/|title=Electronic Frontier Foundation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[home appliance]]s, medical, commercial and military applications.\n\n[[Telecommunication]]s systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] at the [[end user]].\nComputer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.\n\n[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].\nHousehold appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.\n\nTransportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.\nNew airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.\nVarious electric motors \u2014 [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s \u2014 use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.\n[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.\nOther automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].\n\n[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections. Embedded systems within medical equipment are often powered by industrial computers.<ref>[http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/oem-industry-solutions-build-your-product-with-dell Embedded Systems Dell OEM Solutions | Dell].

In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.\n\nA new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charged.\n\nEmbedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.\n\n==Characteristics==\nEmbedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.\n\nEmbedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.<ref>[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com \u2013 Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195311/http://embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 |date=2008-07-08 }} By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design \u2013 Embedded.com</ref> Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.\n\n[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 & eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]\nThe program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"MicroVGA\">For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.\nSimple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].\n\nMore sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a \"joystick button\" for a pointing device.\n\nSome systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.\n\n===Processors in embedded systems===\nExamples of properties of typical embedded computers, when compared with general-purpose counterparts, are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.<ref name=\"Alippi2014\">C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.</ref> For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.<ref>S. Mittal, \"[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]\", IJCAET, 6(4), 440\u2013459, 2014.</ref>\n\nEmbedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (\u03bcP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (\u03bcC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since the software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.\n\n[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.\n\n====Ready-made computer boards====\n[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.\n\nIn certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general-purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.\n\nHowever, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI busses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.\n\nOne common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real-time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.\n\nImplementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].\n\n====ASIC and FPGA solutions====\nA common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).\n\n===Peripherals===\n[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]\n\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:\n* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.\n* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)\n* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)\n* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)\n* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.\n* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.\n* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s\n* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)\n* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])\n* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.\n\n===Tools===\nAs with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:\n* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).\n* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.\n* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.\n* System-level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that help a designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.\n* A model-based development tool creates and simulates graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.\n* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.\n* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].\n* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]\n* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]\n\nSoftware tools can come from several sources:\n* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market\n* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools\n* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor\n\nAs the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher-level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, and medical applications.\nSome examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.\n\n==Debugging==\nEmbedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).\n\nFrom simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:\n* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)\n* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.\n* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288\u2013301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}</ref> This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. \n* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.\n* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.\n* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286\u2013297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}</ref>\n\nUnless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.\n\nBecause an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).\nAn increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.\n\n===Tracing===\n\nReal-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors.\n\n===Reliability===\nEmbedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.\n\nSpecific reliability issues may include:\n* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.\n* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. \"Limp modes\" are less tolerable. Often backups are selected by an operator. Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.\n* The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.\n\nA variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors\u2014both software bugs such as [[memory leak]]s, and also [[soft error]]s in the hardware:\n* [[watchdog timer]] that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software \"limp modes\" that provide partial function\n* Designing with a [[Trusted Computing Base]] (TCB) architecture<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://c59951.r51.cf2.rackcdn.com/5557-528-heiser.pdf |title=Your System is secure?

This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.\n* [[Immunity Aware Programming]]\n\n===High vs. low volume===\nFor high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just \u201cgood enough\u201d to implement the necessary functions.\n\nFor low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general-purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].\n\n==Embedded software architectures==\n{{Main|Embedded software}}\n\nIn 1978 [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] released a standard for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.\n\nThere are several different types of software architecture in common use today.\n\n===Simple control loop===\nIn this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop calls [[subroutine]]s, each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.\n\n===Interrupt-controlled system===\nSome embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.\n\nThese kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.\n\nSometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.\n\n===Cooperative multitasking===\nA non-preemptive multitasking system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Barr-glossary\" /> The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to \u201crun\u201d in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called \u201cpause\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d, \u201cyield\u201d, \u201cnop\u201d (stands for ''no operation''), etc.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.\n\n===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===\nIn this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an \"operating system\" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.\n\nAs any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.\n\nBecause of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.clarinox.com/docs/whitepapers/Whitepaper_06_CrossPlatformDiscussion.pdf\n|title= Working across Multiple Embedded Platforms\n|publisher=clarinox\n|accessdate=2010-08-17\n}}</ref> The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally, the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, [[Bluetooth]], [[Wireless LAN]], trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.\n\n===Microkernels and exokernels===\nA [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User-mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.\n\nIn general, microkernels succeed when task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.\n\n[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.\n\n===Monolithic kernels===\nIn this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.\n\nCommon examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]], [[VXWorks]] and [[Windows CE]].\n\nDespite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:\n* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.\n* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.\n* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.\n* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].\n\n===Additional software components===\nIn addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller\u2013area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included. In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.\n\n===Domain-specific architectures===\nIn the automotive sector, [[AUTOSAR]] is a standard architecture for embedded software.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Communications server]]\n* [[Cyber-physical system]]\n* [[Digital signal processing|DSP]]\n* [[Electronic control unit]]\n* [[Hypervisor]]\n* [[Embedded operating system]]s\n* [[Embedded software]]\n* [[Firmware]]\n* [[FPGA]]\n* [[Information appliance]]\n* [[Microprocessor]]\n* [[Microcontroller]]\n* [[Silicon compiler]]\n* [[Real-time operating system]]\n* [[Software engineering]]\n* [[System on a chip]]\n* [[System on module]]\n* [[Ubiquitous computing]]\n* [[Photonically Optimized Embedded Microprocessors]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |title=Designing Embedded Hardware, 2nd Edition |author=John Catsoulis |date=May 2005 |publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=0-596-00755-8}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Embedded Systems, An Introduction Using the Renesas RX62N Microcontroller |author1=James M.

In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).\n\nSince the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, [[design engineer]]s can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from [[economies of scale]].\n\nEmbedded systems range from portable devices such as [[digital watch]]es and [[MP3 player]]s, to large stationary installations like [[Traffic light control and coordination|traffic light controllers]], [[programmable logic controller]]s, and large complex systems like [[hybrid vehicles]], [[medical imaging]] systems, and [[avionics]]. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, [[peripheral]]s and networks mounted inside a large [[equipment rack]].\n\n==History==\n=== Background ===\n{{See also|Microprocessor chronology}}\n\nThe origins of the [[microprocessor]] and the [[microcontroller]] can be traced back to the [[MOS integrated circuit]], which is an [[integrated circuit]] chip [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] from [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor [[field-effect transistor]]s) and was developed in the early 1960s. By 1964, MOS chips had reached higher [[transistor density]] and lower manufacturing costs than [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] chips. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by [[Moore's law]], leading to [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) with hundreds of [[transistors]] on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to [[computing]] was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete [[computer processor]] system could be contained on several MOS LSI chips.<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=48\u201354 |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |accessdate=13 October 2019|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7551353 }}</ref>\n\nThe first multi-chip microprocessors, the [[Four-Phase Systems AL1]] in 1969 and the [[Garrett AiResearch]] [[MP944]] in 1970, were developed with multiple MOS LSI chips. The first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]], released in 1971. It was developed by [[Federico Faggin]], using his [[silicon-gate]] MOS technology, along with [[Intel]] engineers [[Marcian Hoff]] and [[Stan Mazor]], and [[Busicom]] engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |website=The Silicon Engine |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Development ===\nOne of the very first recognizably modern embedded systems was the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]],{{citation needed|reason=linked article claims it is the first IC-based computer. nothing there supports it being the first embedded system.|date=August 2018}} developed ca. 1965 by [[Charles Stark Draper]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]]. At the project's inception, the Apollo guidance computer was considered the riskiest item in the Apollo project as it employed the then newly developed [[monolithic integrated circuit]]s to reduce the size and weight. \n\nAn early mass-produced embedded system was the [[D-17B|Autonetics D-17 guidance computer]] for the [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman missile]], released in 1961. When the Minuteman II went into production in 1966, the D-17 was replaced with a new computer that was the first high-volume use of integrated circuits.\n\nSince these early applications in the 1960s, embedded systems have come down in price and there has been a dramatic rise in processing power and functionality. An early [[microprocessor]], the [[Intel 4004]] (released in 1971), was designed for [[calculator]]s and other small systems but still required external memory and support chips. By the early 1980s, memory, input and output system components had been integrated into the same chip as the processor forming a [[microcontroller]]. As the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers fell it became feasible to replace expensive knob-based [[Analogue electronics|analog]] components such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[variable capacitor]]s with up/down buttons or knobs read out by a microprocessor even in consumer products. Microcontrollers find applications where a general-purpose computer would be too costly.\n\nToday, a comparatively low-cost microcontroller may be programmed to fulfill the same role as a large number of separate components. Although in this context an embedded system is usually more complex than a traditional solution, most of the complexity is contained within the microcontroller itself. Very few additional components may be needed and most of the design effort is in the software. Software prototype and test can be quicker compared with the design and construction of a new circuit not using an embedded processor.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Accupoll-embedded-computer.jpg|thumb|Embedded Computer Sub-Assembly for Accupoll Electronic Voting Machine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/|title=Electronic Frontier Foundation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, industrial, [[Automotive industry|automotive]], [[home appliance]]s, medical, commercial and military applications.\n\n[[Telecommunication]]s systems employ numerous embedded systems from [[telephone switch]]es for the network to [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] at the [[end user]].\nComputer networking uses dedicated [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[network bridge]]s to route data.\n\n[[Consumer electronics]] include [[MP3 player]]s, mobile phones, [[video game console]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers, and [[computer printer|printers]].\nHousehold appliances, such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwashers]], include embedded systems to provide flexibility, efficiency and features. Advanced [[HVAC]] systems use networked [[thermostat]]s to more accurately and efficiently control temperature that can change by time of day and [[season]]. [[Home automation]] uses wired- and wireless-networking that can be used to control lights, climate, security, audio/visual, surveillance, etc., all of which use embedded devices for sensing and controlling.\n\nTransportation systems from flight to automobiles increasingly use embedded systems.\nNew airplanes contain advanced [[avionics]] such as [[inertial guidance system]]s and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers that also have considerable safety requirements.\nVarious electric motors \u2014 [[brushless DC motor]]s, [[induction motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s \u2014 use electric/electronic [[motor controller]]s.\n[[Automobile]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, and [[hybrid vehicle]]s increasingly use embedded systems to maximize efficiency and reduce pollution.\nOther automotive safety systems include [[anti-lock braking system]] (ABS), [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC/ESP), [[Traction control system|traction control]] (TCS) and automatic [[four-wheel drive]].\n\n[[Medical equipment]] uses embedded systems for [[vital signs]] monitoring, [[electronic stethoscope]]s for amplifying sounds, and various [[medical imaging]] ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]], [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]) for non-invasive internal inspections.

In dealing with security, the embedded systems can be self-sufficient and be able to deal with cut electrical and communication systems.\n\nA new class of miniature wireless devices called [[mote (sensor)|motes]] are networked wireless sensors. Wireless sensor networking, [[WSN]], makes use of miniaturization made possible by advanced IC design to couple full wireless subsystems to sophisticated sensors, enabling people and companies to measure a myriad of things in the physical world and act on this information through IT monitoring and control systems. These motes are completely self-contained, and will typically run off a battery source for years before the batteries need to be changed or charged.\n\nEmbedded Wi-Fi modules provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that communicates via a serial port.\n\n==Characteristics==\nEmbedded systems are designed to do some specific task, rather than be a general-purpose computer for multiple tasks. Some also have [[Real-time computing|real-time]] performance constraints that must be met, for reasons such as safety and usability; others may have low or no performance requirements, allowing the system hardware to be simplified to reduce costs.\n\nEmbedded systems are not always standalone devices. Many embedded systems consist of small parts within a larger device that serves a more general purpose. For example, the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] features an embedded system for tuning the strings, but the overall purpose of the Robot Guitar is, of course, to play music.<ref>[http://www.embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 Embedded.com \u2013 Under the Hood: Robot Guitar embeds autotuning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195311/http://embedded.com/underthehood/207401418 |date=2008-07-08 }} By David Carey, TechOnline EE Times (04/22/08, 11:10:00 AM EDT)Embedded Systems Design \u2013 Embedded.com</ref> Similarly, an embedded system in an [[automobile]] provides a specific function as a subsystem of the car itself.\n\n[[File:ESOM270 eSOM300 Computer on Modules.jpg|thumb|e-con Systems eSOM270 & eSOM300 Computer on Modules]]\nThe program instructions written for embedded systems are referred to as [[firmware]], and are stored in read-only memory or [[flash memory]] chips. They run with limited computer hardware resources: little memory, small or non-existent keyboard or screen.\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:MicroVGA TUI demoapp.jpg|thumb|Embedded system [[text user interface]] using MicroVGA<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"MicroVGA\">For more details of MicroVGA see this [http://www.microvga.com/pdf/uvga-text-ds.pdf PDF].</ref>]]\n\nEmbedded systems range from [[Headless system|no user interface]] at all, in systems dedicated only to one task, to complex [[Desktop operating system#Graphical user interfaces|graphical user interfaces]] that resemble modern computer desktop operating systems.\nSimple embedded devices use [[Push-button|buttons]], [[LED]]s, graphic or character [[LCD]]s ([[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780 LCD]] for example) with a simple [[menu (computing)|menu system]].\n\nMore sophisticated devices that use a graphical screen with [[touch screen|touch]] sensing or screen-edge buttons provide flexibility while minimizing space used: the meaning of the buttons can change with the screen, and selection involves the natural behavior of pointing at what is desired. [[Mobile device|Handheld systems]] often have a screen with a \"joystick button\" for a pointing device.\n\nSome systems provide user interface remotely with the help of a serial (e.g. [[RS-232]], [[USB]], [[I\u00b2C]], etc.) or network (e.g. [[Ethernet]]) connection. This approach gives several advantages: extends the capabilities of embedded system, avoids the cost of a display, simplifies [[Board support package|BSP]] and allows one to build a rich user interface on the PC. A good example of this is the combination of an [[Embedded HTTP server|embedded web server]] running on an embedded device (such as an [[IP camera]]) or a [[Router (computing)|network router]]. The user interface is displayed in a [[web browser]] on a PC connected to the device, therefore needing no software to be installed.\n\n===Processors in embedded systems===\nExamples of properties of typical embedded computers, when compared with general-purpose counterparts, are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available.<ref name=\"Alippi2014\">C.Alippi: ''Intelligence for Embedded Systems.'' Springer, 2014, 283pp, {{ISBN|978-3-319-05278-6}}.</ref> For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems.<ref>S. Mittal, \"[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]\", IJCAET, 6(4), 440\u2013459, 2014.</ref>\n\nEmbedded processors can be broken into two broad categories. Ordinary microprocessors (\u03bcP) use separate integrated circuits for memory and peripherals. Microcontrollers (\u03bcC) have on-chip peripherals, thus reducing power consumption, size and cost. In contrast to the personal computer market, many different basic [[CPU architecture]]s are used since the software is custom-developed for an application and is not a commodity product installed by the end user. Both [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] as well as various degrees of [[Harvard architecture]]s are used. [[RISC]] as well as non-RISC processors are found. Word lengths vary from 4-bit to 64-bits and beyond, although the most typical remain 8/16-bit. Most architectures come in a large number of different variants and shapes, many of which are also manufactured by several different companies.\n\n[[List of common microcontrollers|Numerous microcontrollers]] have been developed for embedded systems use. General-purpose microprocessors are also used in embedded systems, but generally, require more support circuitry than microcontrollers.\n\n====Ready-made computer boards====\n[[PC/104]] and PC/104+ are examples of standards for ''ready-made'' computer boards intended for small, low-volume embedded and ruggedized systems, mostly x86-based. These are often physically small compared to a standard PC, although still quite large compared to most simple (8/16-bit) embedded systems. They often use [[DOS]], [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], or an embedded [[real-time operating system]] such as [[MicroC/OS-II]], [[QNX]] or [[VxWorks]]. Sometimes these boards use non-x86 processors.\n\nIn certain applications, where small size or power efficiency are not primary concerns, the components used may be compatible with those used in general-purpose x86 personal computers. Boards such as the VIA [[EPIA]] range help to bridge the gap by being PC-compatible but highly integrated, physically smaller or have other attributes making them attractive to embedded engineers. The advantage of this approach is that low-cost commodity components may be used along with the same software development tools used for general software development. Systems built in this way are still regarded as embedded since they are integrated into larger devices and fulfill a single role. Examples of devices that may adopt this approach are [[Automated teller machines|ATMs]] and [[arcade machines]], which contain code specific to the application.\n\nHowever, most ready-made embedded systems boards are not PC-centered and do not use the ISA or PCI busses. When a [[system-on-a-chip]] processor is involved, there may be little benefit to having a standardized bus connecting discrete components, and the environment for both hardware and software tools may be very different.\n\nOne common design style uses a small system module, perhaps the size of a business card, holding high density [[Ball grid array|BGA]] chips such as an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[system-on-a-chip]] processor and peripherals, external [[flash memory]] for storage, and [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] for runtime memory. The module vendor will usually provide boot software and make sure there is a selection of operating systems, usually including [[Linux]] and some real-time choices. These modules can be manufactured in high volume, by organizations familiar with their specialized testing issues, and combined with much lower volume custom mainboards with application-specific external peripherals.\n\nImplementation of embedded systems has advanced so that they can easily be implemented with already-made boards that are based on worldwide accepted platforms. These platforms include, but are not limited to, [[Arduino]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].\n\n====ASIC and FPGA solutions====\nA common array for very-high-volume embedded systems is the [[system on a chip]] (SoC) that contains a complete system consisting of multiple processors, multipliers, caches and interfaces on a single chip. SoCs can be implemented as an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) or using a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA).\n\n===Peripherals===\n[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded [[Ethernet]] chip]]\n\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world via [[peripheral]]s, such as:\n* Serial Communication Interfaces (SCI): [[RS-232]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], etc.\n* Synchronous Serial Communication Interface: [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], SSC and ESSI (Enhanced Synchronous Serial Interface)\n* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB)\n* Multi Media Cards (SD cards, Compact Flash, etc.)\n* Networks: [[Ethernet]], [[LonWorks]], etc.\n* [[Fieldbus]]es: [[Controller Area Network|CAN-Bus]], [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN-Bus]], [[PROFIBUS]], etc.\n* Timers: [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]](s), Capture/Compare and [[Time Processing Unit]]s\n* Discrete IO: aka [[General Purpose Input/Output]] (GPIO)\n* Analog to Digital/Digital to Analog ([[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]/[[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]])\n* Debugging: [[JTAG]], [[In-System Programming|ISP]], [[Background Debug Mode interface|BDM]] Port, BITP, and DB9 ports.\n\n===Tools===\nAs with other software, embedded system designers use [[compiler]]s, [[Assembly language|assemblers]], and [[debugger]]s to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:\n* In circuit debuggers or emulators (see next section).\n* Utilities to add a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] to a program, so the embedded system can check if the program is valid.\n* For systems using [[digital signal processing]], developers may use a math workbench to simulate the mathematics.\n* System-level modeling and simulation tools help designers to construct simulation models of a system with hardware components such as [[processors]], [[memories]], [[Direct memory access|DMA]], [[Interface (computing)|interface]]s, buses and software behavior flow as a state diagram or flow diagram using configurable library blocks. Simulation is conducted to select right components by performing power vs. performance trade-off, reliability analysis and bottleneck analysis. Typical reports that help a designer to make architecture decisions includes application latency, device throughput, device utilization, power consumption of the full system as well as device-level power consumption.\n* A model-based development tool creates and simulates graphical data flow and UML state chart diagrams of components like digital filters, motor controllers, communication protocol decoding and multi-rate tasks.\n* Custom compilers and linkers may be used to optimize specialized hardware.\n* An embedded system may have its own special language or design tool, or add enhancements to an existing language such as [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] or [[BASIC Stamp|Basic]].\n* Another alternative is to add a [[real-time operating system]] or [[embedded operating system]]\n* Modeling and code generating [[UML tool|tools]] often based on [[UML state machine|state machines]]\n\nSoftware tools can come from several sources:\n* Software companies that specialize in the embedded market\n* Ported from the [[GNU]] software development tools\n* Sometimes, development tools for a personal computer can be used if the embedded processor is a close relative to a common PC processor\n\nAs the complexity of embedded systems grows, higher-level tools and operating systems are migrating into machinery where it makes sense. For example, [[cellphone]]s, [[personal digital assistant]]s and other consumer computers often need significant software that is purchased or provided by a person other than the manufacturer of the electronics. In these systems, an open programming environment such as [[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[OSGi]] or [[Embedded Java]] is required so that the third-party software provider can sell to a large market.\n\nEmbedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, and medical applications.\nSome examples of embedded systems are MP3 players, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, and GPS. Household appliances, such as microwave ovens, washing machines and dishwashers, include embedded systems to provide flexibility and efficiency.\n\n==Debugging==\nEmbedded [[debugging]] may be performed at different levels, depending on the facilities available. The different metrics that characterize the different forms of embedded debugging are: does it slow down the main application, how close is the debugged system or application to the actual system or application, how expressive are the triggers that can be set for debugging (e.g., inspecting the memory when a particular [[program counter]] value is reached), and what can be inspected in the debugging process (such as, only memory, or memory and registers, etc.).\n\nFrom simplest to most sophisticated they can be roughly grouped into the following areas:\n* Interactive resident debugging, using the simple shell provided by the embedded operating system (e.g. Forth and Basic)\n* External debugging using logging or serial port output to trace operation using either a monitor in flash or using a debug server like the [[Remedy Debugger]] that even works for heterogeneous [[Multi-core processor|multicore]] systems.\n* An in-circuit debugger (ICD), a hardware device that connects to the microprocessor via a [[JTAG]] or [[Nexus (standard)|Nexus]] interface.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Hossain|first2=Mohammad Sajjad|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Raghunathan|first4=Vijay|date=2011|title=Aveksha: A Hardware-software Approach for Non-intrusive Tracing and Profiling of Wireless Embedded Systems|journal=Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems|series=SenSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=288\u2013301|doi=10.1145/2070942.2070972|isbn=9781450307185}}</ref> This allows the operation of the microprocessor to be controlled externally, but is typically restricted to specific debugging capabilities in the processor. \n* An [[in-circuit emulator]] (ICE) replaces the microprocessor with a simulated equivalent, providing full control over all aspects of the microprocessor.\n* A complete [[emulator]] provides a simulation of all aspects of the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The downsides are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.\n* For SoC designs, the typical approach is to verify and debug the design on an FPGA prototype board. Tools such as Certus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20121030-tektronix/ | title=Tektronix Shakes Up Prototyping, Embedded Instrumentation Boosts Boards to Emulator Status| publisher=Electronic Engineering Journal | date= 2012-10-30|accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation. This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGA with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.\n* Software-only debuggers have the benefit that they do not need any hardware modification but have to carefully control what they record in order to conserve time and storage space.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tancreti|first=Matthew|last2=Sundaram|first2=Vinaitheerthan|last3=Bagchi|first3=Saurabh|last4=Eugster|first4=Patrick|date=2015|title=TARDIS: Software-only System-level Record and Replay in Wireless Sensor Networks|journal=Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks|series=IPSN '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=286\u2013297|doi=10.1145/2737095.2737096|isbn=9781450334754}}</ref>\n\nUnless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as [[High-level programming language|HLL]] [[source-code]], [[assembly code]] or mixture of both.\n\nBecause an embedded system is often composed of a wide variety of elements, the debugging strategy may vary. For instance, debugging a software- (and microprocessor-) centric embedded system is different from debugging an embedded system where most of the processing is performed by peripherals (DSP, FPGA, and co-processor).\nAn increasing number of embedded systems today use more than one single processor core. A common problem with multi-core development is the proper synchronization of software execution. In this case, the embedded system design may wish to check the data traffic on the busses between the processor cores, which requires very low-level debugging, at signal/bus level, with a [[logic analyzer]], for instance.\n\n===Tracing===\n\nReal-time operating systems ([[RTOS]]) often supports [[tracing (software)|tracing]] of operating system events. A graphical view is presented by a host PC tool, based on a recording of the system behavior. The trace recording can be performed in software, by the RTOS, or by special tracing hardware. RTOS tracing allows developers to understand timing and performance issues of the software system and gives a good understanding of the high-level system behaviors.\n\n===Reliability===\nEmbedded systems often reside in machines that are expected to run continuously for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. Therefore, the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives, switches or buttons are avoided.\n\nSpecific reliability issues may include:\n* The system cannot safely be shut down for repair, or it is too inaccessible to repair. Examples include space systems, undersea cables, navigational beacons, bore-hole systems, and automobiles.\n* The system must be kept running for safety reasons. \"Limp modes\" are less tolerable. Often backups are selected by an operator. Examples include aircraft navigation, reactor control systems, safety-critical chemical factory controls, train signals.\n* The system will lose large amounts of money when shut down: Telephone switches, factory controls, bridge and elevator controls, funds transfer and market making, automated sales and service.\n\nA variety of techniques are used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors\u2014both software bugs such as [[memory leak]]s, and also [[soft error]]s in the hardware:\n* [[watchdog timer]] that resets the computer unless the software periodically notifies the watchdog subsystems with redundant spares that can be switched over to software \"limp modes\" that provide partial function\n* Designing with a [[Trusted Computing Base]] (TCB) architecture<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://c59951.r51.cf2.rackcdn.com/5557-528-heiser.pdf |title=Your System is secure?

This may also allow a subsystem to be automatically shut down and restarted on fault detection.\n* [[Immunity Aware Programming]]\n\n===High vs. low volume===\nFor high volume systems such as [[Digital audio player|portable music players]] or [[mobile phone]]s, minimizing cost is usually the primary design consideration. Engineers typically select hardware that is just \u201cgood enough\u201d to implement the necessary functions.\n\nFor low-volume or prototype embedded systems, general-purpose computers may be adapted by limiting the programs or by replacing the operating system with a [[real-time operating system]].\n\n==Embedded software architectures==\n{{Main|Embedded software}}\n\nIn 1978 [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] released a standard for programmable microcontrollers, including almost any computer-based controllers, such as single board computers, numerical, and event-based controllers.\n\nThere are several different types of software architecture in common use today.\n\n===Simple control loop===\nIn this design, the software simply has a [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The loop calls [[subroutine]]s, each of which manages a part of the hardware or software. Hence it is called a simple control loop or control loop.\n\n===Interrupt-controlled system===\nSome embedded systems are predominantly controlled by [[interrupt]]s. This means that tasks performed by the system are triggered by different kinds of events; an interrupt could be generated, for example, by a timer in a predefined frequency, or by a serial port controller receiving a byte.\n\nThese kinds of systems are used if event handlers need low latency, and the event handlers are short and simple. Usually, these kinds of systems run a simple task in a main loop also, but this task is not very sensitive to unexpected delays.\n\nSometimes the interrupt handler will add longer tasks to a queue structure. Later, after the interrupt handler has finished, these tasks are executed by the main loop. This method brings the system close to a multitasking kernel with discrete processes.\n\n===Cooperative multitasking===\nA non-preemptive multitasking system is very similar to the simple control loop scheme, except that the loop is hidden in an [[Application programming interface|API]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Barr-glossary\" /> The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task gets its own environment to \u201crun\u201d in. When a task is idle, it calls an idle routine, usually called \u201cpause\u201d, \u201cwait\u201d, \u201cyield\u201d, \u201cnop\u201d (stands for ''no operation''), etc.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages are similar to that of the control loop, except that adding new software is easier, by simply writing a new task, or adding to the queue.\n\n===Preemptive multitasking or multi-threading===\nIn this type of system, a low-level piece of code switches between tasks or threads based on a timer (connected to an interrupt). This is the level at which the system is generally considered to have an \"operating system\" kernel. Depending on how much functionality is required, it introduces more or less of the complexities of managing multiple tasks running conceptually in parallel.\n\nAs any code can potentially damage the data of another task (except in larger systems using an [[Memory management unit|MMU]]) programs must be carefully designed and tested, and access to shared data must be controlled by some synchronization strategy, such as [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]] or a [[non-blocking synchronization]] scheme.\n\nBecause of these complexities, it is common for organizations to use a [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS), allowing the application programmers to concentrate on device functionality rather than operating system services, at least for large systems; smaller systems often cannot afford the overhead associated with a ''generic'' real-time system, due to limitations regarding memory size, performance, or battery life. The choice that an RTOS is required brings in its own issues, however, as the selection must be done prior to starting to the application development process. This timing forces developers to choose the embedded operating system for their device based upon current requirements and so restricts future options to a large extent.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.clarinox.com/docs/whitepapers/Whitepaper_06_CrossPlatformDiscussion.pdf\n|title= Working across Multiple Embedded Platforms\n|publisher=clarinox\n|accessdate=2010-08-17\n}}</ref> The restriction of future options becomes more of an issue as product life decreases. Additionally, the level of complexity is continuously growing as devices are required to manage variables such as serial, USB, TCP/IP, [[Bluetooth]], [[Wireless LAN]], trunk radio, multiple channels, data and voice, enhanced graphics, multiple states, multiple threads, numerous wait states and so on. These trends are leading to the uptake of [[embedded middleware]] in addition to a real-time operating system.\n\n===Microkernels and exokernels===\nA [[microkernel]] is a logical step up from a real-time OS. The usual arrangement is that the operating system kernel allocates memory and switches the CPU to different threads of execution. User-mode processes implement major functions such as file systems, network interfaces, etc.\n\nIn general, microkernels succeed when task switching and intertask communication is fast and fail when they are slow.\n\n[[Exokernel]]s communicate efficiently by normal subroutine calls. The hardware and all the software in the system are available to and extensible by application programmers.\n\n===Monolithic kernels===\nIn this case, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to suit an embedded environment. This gives programmers an environment similar to a desktop operating system like [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows]], and is therefore very productive for development; on the downside, it requires considerably more hardware resources, is often more expensive, and, because of the complexity of these kernels, can be less predictable and reliable.\n\nCommon examples of embedded monolithic kernels are [[embedded Linux]], [[VXWorks]] and [[Windows CE]].\n\nDespite the increased cost in hardware, this type of embedded system is increasing in popularity, especially on the more powerful embedded devices such as [[wireless router]]s and [[Automotive navigation system|GPS navigation systems]]. Here are some of the reasons:\n* Ports to common embedded chip sets are available.\n* They permit re-use of publicly available code for [[device driver]]s, [[web server]]s, [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], and other code.\n* Development systems can start out with broad feature-sets, and then the distribution can be configured to exclude unneeded functionality, and save the expense of the memory that it would consume.\n* Many engineers believe that running application code in user mode is more reliable and easier to debug, thus making the development process easier and the code more portable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* Features requiring faster response than can be guaranteed can often be placed in [[Programmable logic device|hardware]].\n\n===Additional software components===\nIn addition to the core operating system, many embedded systems have additional upper-layer software components. These components consist of networking protocol stacks like [[Controller\u2013area network|CAN]], [[TCP/IP]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], and [[HTTPS]], and also included storage capabilities like [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and flash memory management systems. If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then the appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system. In the case of the monolithic kernels, many of these software layers are included. In the RTOS category, the availability of the additional software components depends upon the commercial offering.\n\n===Domain-specific architectures===\nIn the automotive sector, [[AUTOSAR]] is a standard architecture for embedded software.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Communications server]]\n* [[Cyber-physical system]]\n* [[Digital signal processing|DSP]]\n* [[Electronic control unit]]\n* [[Hypervisor]]\n* [[Embedded operating system]]s\n* [[Embedded software]]\n* [[Firmware]]\n* [[FPGA]]\n* [[Information appliance]]\n* [[Microprocessor]]\n* [[Microcontroller]]\n* [[Silicon compiler]]\n* [[Real-time operating system]]\n* [[Software engineering]]\n* [[System on a chip]]\n* [[System on module]]\n* [[Ubiquitous computing]]\n* [[Photonically Optimized Embedded Microprocessors]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |title=Designing Embedded Hardware, 2nd Edition |author=John Catsoulis |date=May 2005 |publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=0-596-00755-8}}\n* {{Cite book |title=Embedded Systems, An Introduction Using the Renesas RX62N Microcontroller |author1=James M.
