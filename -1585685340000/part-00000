The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932\u20131958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a [[first-class cricket]]er, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]].

Manners was recalled back to Britain in December 1939 aboard {{HMS|Falmouth|L34|6}} and the troop liner {{SS|Strathallan}}.<ref name=\"VICE\">{{cite web|url=http://vandwdestroyerassociation.org.uk/HMS_Viceroy/index.html#Manners |title=HMS Viceroy |publisher=www.vandwdestroyerassociation.org.uk |accessdate=2018-09-15}}</ref><ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 6</ref>\n\nReturning to [[Southampton]] in early January 1940, Manners spent a month on leave at the family home at [[Alverstoke]],<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, pp. 5-6</ref> before being assigned to the destroyer {{HMS|Eglinton|L87|6}} which was under constuction at the Walker Yard on [[River Tyne|the Tyne]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref name=\"VICE\"/> Manners was not one of the officers based at Newcastle to be sent to assist with the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and spent the summer escorting convoys down the east coast following the ''Eglinton's'' commissioning. While at Newcastle, he met Mary Downes (1917\u20131995), an actress with the Newcastle Repertory Company. The couple married in October 1940 at [[Marylebone]] and narrowly avoided being killed on their wedding night when a German bomb hit the [[Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park Hotel]] when they were in its restaurant, but failed to detonate.<ref name=\"TIMES\"/> It was reported at the time to have been the second largest unexploded German bomb to have been recovered during [[The Blitz]].<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, pp. 9, 12-13</ref> In the same month, ''Eglinton'' was chosen to take part in [[Operation Lucid]], a plan to use [[fire ship]]s to attack German [[Operation Sealion|invasion]] barges in ports in northern [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|France]], however while escorting an oil tanker to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] the operation command ship {{HMS|Hambledon |L37|6}} struck a mine, resulting in the cancellation of the operation.<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 14</ref>\n\nSix months later, with ''Eglinton'' based at [[HMS Badger (shore establishment)|Harwich]], Manner's and his wife again avoided death under similar circumstances, when their rented house was hit by a bomb while they were in the bathroom; although unscathed, four other occupants of the house were killed.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> Manners served as a lieutenant aboard ''Eglinton'' until February 1942, after which he held a brief command aboard {{HMS|Fame|H78|6}} which was being repaired at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]]. After a few weeks commanding ''Fame'', Manners was sent to {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|6}} at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], after her first lieutenant had fallen overboard and drowned.<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, pp. 18-19</ref> He served aboard ''Eskimo'' in [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]] during the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Siege of Malta]] in June 1942,<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 20</ref> subsequently seeing action in [[Operation Pedestal|the relief of Malta]], for which he was later [[mentioned in dispatches]]. In September 1942, ''Eskimo'' formed part of [[Convoy PQ 18]] escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|supply ships in the Arctic]] on their way to the [[Soviet Union]],<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> before returning to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to take part in the [[Operation Torch]] landings.<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 60</ref> Manners was made commanding officer of ''Eskimo'' in May 1943, with the ship taking part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, during which she was bombed and severely damaged.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n[[File:HMS Viceroy FL5440.jpg|thumb|left|Manners was commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}} from 1943\u201345]]\nHe took command of the destroyer {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}} in December 1943, while she was being refitted at [[Jarrow]].<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> After a few weeks aboard ''Viceroy'', Manners was seconded to {{HMS|Watchman|D26|6}} at [[Derry]], after her captain had fallen ill and an officer with experience was required to replace him.<ref name=\"VICE\"/> He returned to command ''Viceroy'' after six weeks. Forming part of the [[Rosyth Escort Force]] as an anti-aircraft and anti-E-boat escort to convoys in the North Sea which were carrying supplies from the [[Firth of Forth]] to London, ''Viceroy'' was escorting a convoy on 11 April 1945, when the tanker {{SS|Athelduke}} which was carrying 12,600 tonnes of [[molasses]] was hit by a torpedo from the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] near the [[Farne Islands]], causing two explosions to rock the ship.<ref name=\"TIMES\"/> Realising the convoy was under attack from a U-boat, and that the water was too deep for mines, he turned the ship to port and took off in pursuit, obtaining a contact at 2,200 yards. Manners commanded an urgent attack with depth charges set to \u201cshallow\u201d, the explosion of which temporarily knocked out the electrics aboard ''Viceroy''. Ten minutes later power was restored and a second attack on the U-boat was made, which brought oil to the surface. Reckoning that the U-boat had been sunk at a depth of 250 metres, a third depth-charge set to \u201cdeep\u201d, which caused a prolonged explosion and brought more oil to the surface.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> Two weeks later the kill was confirmed and Manners returned to the scene of the sinking with ''Eskimo'' and {{HMS|Vivien|L33|6}}, recovering twelve bottles of brandy which he sent to [[Winston Churchill]], for which Churchill conveyed his thanks and congratulations on the successful attack.<ref name=\"VICE\"/> His actions in the sinking saw him mentioned in dispatches and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37407|date=28 December 1945|page=78}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37170|date=6 July 1945|page=3561|supp=y}}</ref>\n\nAs the war neared its conclusion, Manners took part in Operation Conan, the Royal Navy's contribution to [[Operation Doomsday|the liberation of Norway]] following the formal German surrender at [[Oslo]] in May 1945. He was the British naval officer in charge in [[Trondheim]], where he received the German surrender there and entertained [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]] aboard ''Viceroy''.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/><ref name=\"VICE\"/> Having been an acting [[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|lieutenant commander]] since May 1945, he achieved the war-substantive rank in July 1945.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37480|date=22 February 1946|page=1089}}</ref>\n\n==Later career and return to cricket==\nUpon leaving ''Viceroy'' in July 1945, Manners was assigned to the troop ship {{RMS|Otranto|1925|6}} for its voyage to Australia,<ref name=\"TIMES\"/> where he was to be loaned to the [[Royal Australian Navy]].<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> When the ship arrived in Australia, which was the birthplace of his mother, it docked at [[Melbourne]] and shortly thereafter Manners sailed for [[Sydney]], with him describing his stay there as one of the dullest periods of his life. With no prospect of being assigned aboard a ship, he flew back to Melbourne aboard a [[Royal Air Force]] [[Douglas DC-3|Dakota]], where his uncle found him work at a sheep station in the [[Western District (Victoria)|Western District of Victoria]].<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 118</ref> After a fortnight at the sheep station, Manners received a phonecall and was assigned to {{HMS|King George V|41|6}} in October 1945, after her first lieutenant had been court-martialled and commander relieved of his duties.<ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 121</ref> The ship spent the majority of the next two months in dry dock at Sydney, during which Manners entertained himself by playing in cricket matches against Sydney's leading public schools, including [[Cranbrook School, Sydney|Cranbrook School]] whose headmaster was the Oxford Blue [[Brian Hone]].<ref name=\"OBIT\"/><ref>Yardley-Latham 2010, p. 122</ref> He remained aboard ''King George V'' until May 1946.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/>\n\n[[File:St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury - Kent vs Gloucestershire 2017 (33085310154).jpg|thumb|right|Manners scored his maiden [[century (cricket)|first-class century]] in 1947 for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] at the [[St Lawrence Ground]] (pictured)]]\nReturning to England, he was appointed the naval liason officer at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], which allowed him to resume playing county cricket.<ref name=\"PCA\"/> He played his first first-class match since 1936 when he played for the [[Combined Services cricket team]] against Gloucestershire [[Bristol County Ground|Bristol]] in 1947.<ref name=\"FCM\"/> His first match back for Hampshire saw him score his maiden first-class century with 121 at almost a run a ball against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] at [[St Lawrence Ground|Canterbury]].<ref name=\"CRIC\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18205.html |title=Kent v Hampshire, 1947 County Championship |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2018-09-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' described the innings as \u201cperfect stroke play, drives, cuts and hooks\u201d.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> He played three further first-class matches for Hampshire in the [[1948 County Championship]], in addition to playing for the Combined Services ''against'' Hampshire and Gloucestershire in that same year.<ref name=\"FCM\"/> Against Gloucestershire, he recorded what would be his highest first-class score of 147.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/6/6744/f_Batting_by_Team.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding For Each Team by John Manners |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2020-03-17 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> His commitments as an officer still limited his availability for Hampshire, with Manners not playing for the county after 1948.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/> He did continue to play first-class matches for the Combined Services until 1953, making twelve appearances.<ref name=\"FCM\"/> He made 123 against the touring [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealanders]] at [[Garrison Ground 2|Gillingham]] in 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18946.html |title=Combined Services v New Zealanders, 1949 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2020-03-17 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> and scored 75 against the touring [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]] in 1950.<ref name=\"CRIC\"/> Manners also appeared for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and the [[Free Foresters Cricket Club|Free Foresters]] in a first-class match apiece for each in 1953.<ref name=\"FCM\"/> He returned to sea in 1953, ending his first-class playing days, before retiring from the navy with the rank of lieutenant commander in April 1958 to become the bursar at [[Dauntsey's School]] in [[Wiltshire]].<ref>[[Stephen Chalke]], ''The Way It Was: Glimpses of English Cricket's Past'', Fairfield Books, Bath, 2011, pp. 264\u201365.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41450|date=18 July 1958|page=4516}}</ref>\n\nHis time as bursar at Duntsey's was not without controversy, when in 1964 he was temporarily suspended after pupils organised a strike to protest the food they were being served.

The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932\u20131958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a [[first-class cricket]]er, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]].

She was principally the companion of Longabaugh. Little is known about her; both her origin and her fate remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]] described her in 1906 as having, \"classic good looks, 27 or 28 years old, 5'4\" to 5'5\" [163\u2013165&nbsp;cm] in height, weighing between {{convert|110|and|115|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, with a medium build and brown hair.\"\n\n==Life with the Sundance Kid==\nAccording to a memorandum from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, dated July 29, 1902, she was \"said ... to be from Texas\", and in another Pinkerton document dated 1906, she is described as being \"27 to 28 years old\", placing her birth between 1878 and 1879. A hospital staff record from [[Denver]], where she received treatment in May 1900, reports her age as \"22 or 23,\" putting her birth year at 1877 or 1878.\n\nLike Etta Place\u2019s history, her name is somewhat ambiguous. \"Place\" was the maiden surname of Longabaugh's mother (Annie Place) and she is recorded in various sources as Mrs. Harry Longabaugh or Mrs. Harry A. Place. In the one instance where she is known to have signed her name, she did so as \"Mrs. Ethel Place\". The Pinkertons called her \"Ethel\", \"Ethal\", \"Eva\", and \"Rita\" before finally settling on \"Etta\" for its [[wanted posters]].<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Meadows |first=Anne |title=Digging up Butch and Sundance |date=28 October 1996 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0803282257 |page=x |edition=Revised, 1st Bison books print}}</ref> Her name may have become \"Etta\" after she moved to South America, where Spanish speakers had trouble pronouncing \"Ethel\".\n\nIn February 1901, Etta Place accompanied Longabaugh to New York City, where at [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] jewelers they purchased a lapel watch and stickpin, and posed for the now-famous DeYoung portrait at a studio in Union Square on Broadway. It is one of only two known images of her. On February 20, 1901, she sailed with him and Parker (who was now posing as \"James Ryan,\" her fictional brother), aboard the British ship ''Herminius'' for [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nThere she settled with the two outlaws on a ranch which they purchased near Cholila in the [[Chubut Province]] of west-central Argentina. It comprised a four-room log cabin on the east bank of the Blanco River. Under a new 1884 law, they were granted 15,000 acres (61&nbsp;km\u00b2) of adjacent land to develop, 2,500 of which belonged to Place, who has the distinction of being the first woman in Argentina to acquire land under the new act as land ownership previously had been almost the exclusive preserve of men.\n\nOn March 3, 1902, she and Longabaugh returned to New York City on the SS ''Soldier Prince'', probably to visit family and friends in the United States. On April 2, they registered at a Mrs. Thompson's rooming house in New York City. They toured Coney Island and visited his family (originally from Mont Clare, Pennsylvania, but by then living in Atlantic City, New Jersey). They also possibly traveled to a Dr. Pierce's Invalid Hotel in Buffalo, New York, for unspecified medical treatment. They then traveled west, where again they sought medical treatment, this time in Denver, Colorado. They returned to Buenos Aires from New York on July 10, 1902, aboard the steamer ''Honorius'', posing as stewards. On August 9, she was with Longabaugh at the Hotel Europa in Buenos Aires, and on the 15th, she sailed with him aboard the steamer SS ''Chubut'' to return to their ranch.\n\nIn the summer of 1904, she made another visit with Longabaugh to the United States, where the Pinkerton Detective Agency traced them to [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and to the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World Fair]], but failed to arrest them before they returned to Argentina. In early 1905, the trio sold the Cholila ranch, as once again the law was beginning to catch up with them. The Pinkerton Agency had known their precise address for months, but the rainy season prevented their assigned agent Frank Dimaio from traveling there and making an arrest. Governor Julio Lezana issued an arrest warrant, but before it could be executed, Sheriff Edward Humphreys, a Welsh Argentinian who was friendly with Parker and enamored of Place, tipped them off. The trio fled north to [[San Carlos de Bariloche]], where they embarked on the steamer ''Condor'' across [[Lake Nahuel Huapi]] and into Chile.\n\nBy the end of that year, however, they were back in Argentina. On December 19, 1904, Place took part, along with Longabaugh, Parker, and an unknown male, in the robbery of the Banco de la Nacion in Villa Mercedes, 400 miles west of Buenos Aires. Pursued by armed lawmen, they crossed the [[Pampas]] and the [[Andes]] and again into Chile.\n\nPlace had long been tired of life on the run and deeply lamented the loss of their ranch. At her request, on June 30, 1906, Longabaugh accompanied her from Valparaiso, Chile to San Francisco, where she apparently remained while he returned permanently to South America. After this parting, no evidence shows that Longabaugh and Place ever saw one another again.\n\n==Mysteries==\nThose who had met Place claimed the first thing they noticed about her was that she was strikingly pretty, with a very nice smile, and that she was cordial, articulate, refined in speech and manners, and an excellent shot with a rifle. She was said to have spoken in an educated manner, and she indicated she was originally from the East Coast, although she never revealed an exact location.\n\nYears later eyewitnesses said that Place was one of only five women known to have been allowed into the Wild Bunch hideout at [[Robbers Roost]] in southern [[Utah]], the other four having been [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|Will Carver]]'s girlfriend [[Josie Bassett]], who also was involved with Parker for a time; Josie's sister and Parker's longtime girlfriend [[Ann Bassett]]; [[Elzy Lay]]'s girlfriend Maude Davis; and gang member [[Laura Bullion]].\nPlace was believed to have once been married to a schoolteacher, and at least one person claimed Place herself was a teacher who abandoned her husband and two children to be with Longabaugh. It has also been speculated that she met the gang while working as a prostitute and was originally Parker's lover and became involved with Longabaugh later, but there is no direct evidence of this.\nIt has also been claimed that she may have met Parker and/or Longabaugh in the brothel of [[Fannie Porter|Madame Fannie Porter]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], which was frequented by members of the Wild Bunch gang.  Several gang members met girlfriends at Madame Porter's who later traveled with them, including [[Kid Curry]] and [[Della Moore]], a prostitute, and [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|Will Carver]] and Lillie Davis. Wild Bunch female gang member Laura Bullion is believed to have worked at the brothel from time to time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ndnd.essortment.com/ettaplacebutch_rnmb.htm |title=Who was Etta Place? |last=Wood |first=Barbara B. |work=Essortment |publisher=Pagewise |date=2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904183227/http://ndnd.essortment.com/ettaplacebutch_rnmb.htm |archive-date=4 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Identity theories===\n====Ethel Bishop====\nIt has been suggested that Place's real name was Ethel Bishop. Such a woman lived at another brothel, at 212 Concho Street, around the corner from Madame Porter's. On the 1900 census, Bishop's occupation was given as an unemployed music teacher. She was 23 at the time, born in West Virginia in September 1876. The Ethel Bishop hypothesis neatly combines, in one person, the speculations that she was a schoolteacher, and the one that she was a prostitute.{{sfn|Meadows|1996|p=36}}\n\n====Ann Bassett====\nAnother conjecture is that she was a [[cattle rustler]] named [[Ann Bassett]] (1878\u20131956) who knew and ran with the Wild Bunch at the turn of the 20th century. Both Bassett and Place were attractive women, with similar facial features, body frame, and hair color. Bassett was born in 1878, the same year Place was thought to have been born. Dr. Thomas G. Kyle of the Computer Research Group at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], who performed many photographic comparisons for government intelligence agencies, conducted a series of tests on photographs of Etta Place and Ann Bassett. Both had the same [[scar]] or [[cowlick]] at the top of their forehead. Dr. Kyle concluded that there could be no reasonable doubt they were the same person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/justwhowastheoutlawqueenettaplace.html |title=Just Who Was the Outlaw Queen Etta Place? |last=Reeve |first=W.

Several documents prove that Bassett was in Wyoming during much of the time when Place was in South America. Bassett was arrested and briefly incarcerated in Utah for rustling cattle in 1903 while Place was in South America with Longabaugh and Parker. Bassett also married her first husband in Utah that year, and therefore, could not have been in South America during that time.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.criminalelement.com/the-mysterious-disappearance-of-etta-place |title=The Mysterious Disappearance of Etta Place |last=Hays |first=Tony |date=14 August 2011 |work=CriminalElement}}</ref>\n\n====Eunice Gray====\nA once popular theory held that she was [[Eunice Gray]], who for many years operated a brothel in Fort Worth, Texas, and later ran the Waco Hotel there until she died in a fire in January 1962. Gray once told Delbert Willis of the ''[[Fort Worth Press]]'', \"I've lived in Fort Worth since 1901. That is except for the time I had to high-tail it out of town. Went to South America for a few years ... until things settled down.\" Willis conceded that Gray never claimed to be Etta Place; he merely made that connection on his own, given the similarities in their ages, and the period in which Gray said she was in South America coinciding with Place's time there. Gray was described as a beautiful woman, and Willis believed that Place and Gray held a striking resemblance to one another, but there were no known photographs of Gray from that period to compare with Place's.  In 2007, amateur genealogist Donna Donnell found Eunice Gray on a 1911 passenger list from Panama. Following that lead, she tracked down Gray's niece, who had two photographs of her: one taken at her high school graduation circa 1896, and another from sometime in the 1920s. Comparing those photos to Place's, both agreed that Eunice Gray was definitely not Etta Place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genealogue.com/2007/03/womans-face-proves-shes-no-place.html |title=Woman's Face Proves She's No Place |work=The Genealogue |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Madaline Wilson====\nYet another theory suggests that Place was actually Madaline Wilson, another girl in Fannie Porter's brothel. Sleuth Tony Hays notes that of the five girls in Fannie's \u201cboarding house,\" all were born around 1878\u201380. One girl, 22-year-old Wilson, appeared in the 1900 census records of Bexar County, Texas, immediately beneath Madame Porter's name. Like Porter, Wilson was listed as being of English birth, immigrating to the United States in 1884 at the age of six. Hays theorizes that Wilson changed her name, and that her British accent, tempered by 16 years in America, might be described as \"refined.\" All traces of Wilson disappeared after the 1900 census after Place and Longabaugh left town.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Life after Longabaugh===\nThere is still considerable debate over when Place's relationship with Longabaugh ended. Some claims indicate that Place ended her relationship with Longabaugh and returned to the United States before his death. Others believe that the two remained romantically involved, and that she simply tired of life in South America. By 1907, she was known to have been living in San Francisco, but after that, she vanished without a trace.\n\nIn 1909, a woman matching Place's description asked Frank Aller (US Vice-Consul in Antofagasta, Chile) for assistance in obtaining a death certificate for Longabaugh. No such certificate was issued, and the woman's identity was never ascertained.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacKell |first=Jan |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIpSl6MJoFMC&lpg=PA333&pg=PA333#v=onepage |title=Red Light Women of the Rocky Mountains |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0826346103 |p=333}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Richard Llewellyn claimed that while in Argentina he found indications that Place had moved to Paraguay following the death of Longabaugh, and that she had married a wealthy man. There also were rumors that Etta Place was in fact Edith Mae, wife of famous boxing promoter [[Tex Rickard]], who retired to a ranch in Paraguay shortly after promoting the famous fight between [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[James J. Jeffries|Jim Jeffries]] in 1910.\n\nA Pinkerton report states that a woman matching Place's description was killed in a shootout resulting from a domestic dispute with a man named Mateo Gebhart in Chubut, Argentina, in March 1922. Another report claims she committed suicide in 1924 in Argentina, and yet another states that she died of natural causes in 1966.\n\nThere have been various additional claims about her life after the death of Longabaugh. Some believe that she returned to New York City, while other theories suggest she moved back to Texas and started a new life there. One claim is that she returned to her life as a schoolteacher, living the remainder of her life in Denver, Colorado, and another story says she lived the remainder of her life teaching in [[Marion, Oregon]]. There are also various claims that she returned to prostitution, living the remainder of her life in Texas, California or New York. However, these claims are mere speculation, without any supporting evidence.\n\nAuthor and researcher Larry Pointer, author of the 1977 book ''In Search of Butch Cassidy'', wrote that Place's identity and fate are \"one of the most intriguing riddles in western history. Leads develop only to dissolve into ambiguity.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3Bhkad9SwoC |last=Pointer |first=Larry |year=1977 |title=In Search of Butch Cassidy |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0806114552}}</ref>\n\n==Fact timelines generally accepted by historians==\n* 1899\u20131900: Place was living in Texas and being courted by Harry A. Longabaugh, also known as the Sundance Kid. Some stories claim Place was a housekeeper or possibly a prostitute in Fannie Porter's sporting house during this time.\n* December 1900: Place and Longabaugh reportedly marry, he using the alias Harry A.

Pinkerton detectives find evidence that Place was homesick and wanting to visit her family, but were unable to identify who her family was.\n* April 2, 1902: Longabaugh and Place register at Mrs. Thompson's Boarding House in New York City, and visit members of his family in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], then visit [[Coney Island]].\n* July 10, 1902: Place and Longabaugh pose as stewards and sail on the steamer ''Honorius'' back to Argentina.\n* August 9, 1902: Place registers them at the Hotel Europa in Buenos Aires.\n* Early to late 1903: Parker's former lover Ann Bassett marries a rancher by the name of Henry Bernard, and shortly thereafter is arrested for rustling.\n* Summer 1904: Place and Longabaugh sail again to New York City to visit her family. Once again Pinkerton detectives discover she is homesick, but cannot discover the identity of her family.\n* May 1, 1905: Place, Longabaugh, and Parker decide to sell their ranch in [[Cholila, Argentina]], and leave South America to avoid the law there. Longabaugh and Place sail to [[San Francisco]], where she remains, and he returns to South America.\n* 1907: Place is living alone in San Francisco, and there is no evidence she has seen Longabaugh since his departure two years prior.\n* July 31, 1909: A woman matching Place's description attempts to obtain a death certificate following Longabaugh's death in [[Bolivia]] so that she can settle his estate. She disappears from all historical records after that. With Longabaugh dead, Pinkerton's interest in her location wanes, and her trail goes cold.\n\n==Media depictions==\n* In the 1969 film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', Etta Place is depicted as a schoolteacher. Screenwriter [[William Goldman]] was suspicious of claims that Place was a prostitute; he believed she was too attractive and vibrant to have worked as a prostitute, a profession that tended to age women prematurely and tax their health.<ref>See the 2001 History Channel documentary ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time''.</ref> Place was portrayed in the film by [[Katharine Ross]].\n* [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] portrayed Etta Place in ''Mrs. Sundance'', a highly fictionalized 1974 television movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071868/ |title=Mrs. Sundance (TV Movie 1974) |date=15 January 1974 |work=IMDb}}</ref>\n* [[Katharine Ross]] reprised her role as Etta Place in ''Wanted: The Sundance Woman'', a fictional 1976 made-for-television movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075412/ |title=Wanted: The Sundance Woman (TV Movie 1976) |date=1 October 1976 |work=IMDb}}</ref>\n* In the 1994 TV movie ''The Gambler V: Playing for Keeps'', Etta Place is played by [[Mariska Hargitay]].\n* In the 2004 TV movie ''[[The Legend of Butch & Sundance]]'', [[Rachelle Lefevre]] portrays Etta Place.\n* Etta Place was played by [[Dominique McElligott]] in the 2011 film ''[[Blackthorn (film)|Blackthorn]]''.\n* Etta Place was the central character in ''Etta: A Novel'' by Gerald Kolpan, published in 2009 by Ballantine Books.<ref>{{cite web |last=Oldenburg |first=Don |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/28/gerald-kolpans-novel-doesnt-do-justice-to-the-outlaw-etta/2469107/ |title=Gerald Kolpan's novel doesn't do justice to the outlaw Etta |work=[[USA Today]] |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Outlaw]]s\n* [[American Old West]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Answer Man: Mysterious Etta Place'' by Chuck Parsons\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080216070245/http://www.sundancekidhenrylong.com/ Etta Place] at ''Sundance Kid and Henry Long''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Place, Etta}}\n[[Category:1870s births]]\n[[Category:People from Texas]]\n[[Category:American folklore]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:American emigrants to Argentina]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American companion of the outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid}}\n{{refimprove|date = February 2019}}\n{{Infobox person\n| honorific_prefix   = \n| name               = Etta Place\n| honorific_suffix   = \n| image              = Sundance Kid and wife-clean.jpg\n| image_upright      = \n| landscape          = <!-- yes, if wide image, otherwise leave blank -->\n| alt                = <!-- descriptive text for use by speech synthesis (text-to-speech) software -->\n| caption            = [[Harry Longabaugh]] (the Sundance Kid) and Etta Place, just before they sailed for South America.\n| native_name        = \n| native_name_lang   = \n| pronunciation      = \n| birth_name         = <!-- only use if different from name -->\n| birth_date         = {{circa}} {{Birth year|1878}}\n| birth_place        = [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], U.S. <small>(alleged)</small>\n| baptised           = <!-- will not display if birth_date is entered -->\n| disappeared_date   = {{Disappeared date and age|1909|07|31|1878}}\n| disappeared_place  = [[Antofagasta]], [[Chile]]\n| disappeared_status = Fate unknown\n| death_date         = <!-- {{Death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} (DEATH date then BIRTH date) -->\n| death_place        = \n| death_cause        = \n| body_discovered    = \n| resting_place      = \n| resting_place_coordinates = <!-- {{coord|LAT|LONG|type:landmark|display=inline}} -->\n| burial_place       = <!-- may be used instead of resting_place and resting_place_coordinates (displays \"Burial place\" as label) -->\n| burial_coordinates = <!-- {{coord|LAT|LONG|type:landmark|display=inline}} -->\n| monuments          = \n| residence          = \n| nationality        = \n| other_names        = Ethel Place\n| citizenship        = \n| education          = \n| alma_mater         = \n| occupation         = teacher, prostitute <small>(alleged)</small>\n| years_active       = \n| era                = \n| employer           = \n| organization       = \n| agent = <!-- Discouraged in most cases, specifically when promotional, and requiring a reliable source -->\n| known_for          = \n| notable_works      = <!-- produces label \"Notable work\";

She was principally the companion of Longabaugh. Little is known about her; both her origin and her fate remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]] described her in 1906 as having, \"classic good looks, 27 or 28 years old, 5'4\" to 5'5\" [163\u2013165&nbsp;cm] in height, weighing between {{convert|110|and|115|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, with a medium build and brown hair.\"\n\n==Life with the Sundance Kid==\nAccording to a memorandum from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, dated July 29, 1902, she was \"said ... to be from Texas\", and in another Pinkerton document dated 1906, she is described as being \"27 to 28 years old\", placing her birth between 1878 and 1879. A hospital staff record from [[Denver]], where she received treatment in May 1900, reports her age as \"22 or 23,\" putting her birth year at 1877 or 1878.\n\nLike Etta Place\u2019s history, her name is somewhat ambiguous. \"Place\" was the maiden surname of Longabaugh's mother (Annie Place) and she is recorded in various sources as Mrs. Harry Longabaugh or Mrs. Harry A. Place. In the one instance where she is known to have signed her name, she did so as \"Mrs. Ethel Place\". The Pinkertons called her \"Ethel\", \"Ethal\", \"Eva\", and \"Rita\" before finally settling on \"Etta\" for its [[wanted posters]].<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Meadows |first=Anne |title=Digging up Butch and Sundance |date=28 October 1996 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0803282257 |page=x |edition=Revised, 1st Bison books print}}</ref> Her name may have become \"Etta\" after she moved to South America, where Spanish speakers had trouble pronouncing \"Ethel\".\n\nIn February 1901, Etta Place accompanied Longabaugh to New York City, where at [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] jewelers they purchased a lapel watch and stickpin, and posed for the now-famous DeYoung portrait at a studio in Union Square on Broadway. It is one of only two known images of her. On February 20, 1901, she sailed with him and Parker (who was now posing as \"James Ryan,\" her fictional brother), aboard the British ship ''Herminius'' for [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nThere she settled with the two outlaws on a ranch which they purchased near Cholila in the [[Chubut Province]] of west-central Argentina. It comprised a four-room log cabin on the east bank of the Blanco River. Under a new 1884 law, they were granted 15,000 acres (61&nbsp;km\u00b2) of adjacent land to develop, 2,500 of which belonged to Place, who has the distinction of being the first woman in Argentina to acquire land under the new act as land ownership previously had been almost the exclusive preserve of men.\n\nOn March 3, 1902, she and Longabaugh returned to New York City on the SS ''Soldier Prince'', probably to visit family and friends in the United States. On April 2, they registered at a Mrs. Thompson's rooming house in New York City. They toured Coney Island and visited his family (originally from Mont Clare, Pennsylvania, but by then living in Atlantic City, New Jersey). They also possibly traveled to a Dr. Pierce's Invalid Hotel in Buffalo, New York, for unspecified medical treatment. They then traveled west, where again they sought medical treatment, this time in Denver, Colorado. They returned to Buenos Aires from New York on July 10, 1902, aboard the steamer ''Honorius'', posing as stewards. On August 9, she was with Longabaugh at the Hotel Europa in Buenos Aires, and on the 15th, she sailed with him aboard the steamer SS ''Chubut'' to return to their ranch.\n\nIn the summer of 1904, she made another visit with Longabaugh to the United States, where the Pinkerton Detective Agency traced them to [[Fort Worth]], Texas, and to the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World Fair]], but failed to arrest them before they returned to Argentina. In early 1905, the trio sold the Cholila ranch, as once again the law was beginning to catch up with them. The Pinkerton Agency had known their precise address for months, but the rainy season prevented their assigned agent Frank Dimaio from traveling there and making an arrest. Governor Julio Lezana issued an arrest warrant, but before it could be executed, Sheriff Edward Humphreys, a Welsh Argentinian who was friendly with Parker and enamored of Place, tipped them off. The trio fled north to [[San Carlos de Bariloche]], where they embarked on the steamer ''Condor'' across [[Lake Nahuel Huapi]] and into Chile.\n\nBy the end of that year, however, they were back in Argentina. On December 19, 1904, Place took part, along with Longabaugh, Parker, and an unknown male, in the robbery of the Banco de la Nacion in Villa Mercedes, 400 miles west of Buenos Aires. Pursued by armed lawmen, they crossed the [[Pampas]] and the [[Andes]] and again into Chile.\n\nPlace had long been tired of life on the run and deeply lamented the loss of their ranch. At her request, on June 30, 1906, Longabaugh accompanied her from Valparaiso, Chile to San Francisco, where she apparently remained while he returned permanently to South America. After this parting, no evidence shows that Longabaugh and Place ever saw one another again.\n\n==Mysteries==\nThose who had met Place claimed the first thing they noticed about her was that she was strikingly pretty, with a very nice smile, and that she was cordial, articulate, refined in speech and manners, and an excellent shot with a rifle. She was said to have spoken in an educated manner, and she indicated she was originally from the East Coast, although she never revealed an exact location.\n\nYears later eyewitnesses said that Place was one of only five women known to have been allowed into the Wild Bunch hideout at [[Robbers Roost]] in southern [[Utah]], the other four having been [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|Will Carver]]'s girlfriend [[Josie Bassett]], who also was involved with Parker for a time; Josie's sister and Parker's longtime girlfriend [[Ann Bassett]]; [[Elzy Lay]]'s girlfriend Maude Davis; and gang member [[Laura Bullion]].\nPlace was believed to have once been married to a schoolteacher, and at least one person claimed Place herself was a teacher who abandoned her husband and two children to be with Longabaugh. It has also been speculated that she met the gang while working as a prostitute and was originally Parker's lover and became involved with Longabaugh later, but there is no direct evidence of this.\nIt has also been claimed that she may have met Parker and/or Longabaugh in the brothel of [[Fannie Porter|Madame Fannie Porter]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], which was frequented by members of the Wild Bunch gang.  Several gang members met girlfriends at Madame Porter's who later traveled with them, including [[Kid Curry]] and [[Della Moore]], a prostitute, and [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|Will Carver]] and Lillie Davis. Wild Bunch female gang member Laura Bullion is believed to have worked at the brothel from time to time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ndnd.essortment.com/ettaplacebutch_rnmb.htm |title=Who was Etta Place? |last=Wood |first=Barbara B. |work=Essortment |publisher=Pagewise |date=2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904183227/http://ndnd.essortment.com/ettaplacebutch_rnmb.htm |archive-date=4 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Identity theories===\n====Ethel Bishop====\nIt has been suggested that Place's real name was Ethel Bishop. Such a woman lived at another brothel, at 212 Concho Street, around the corner from Madame Porter's.On the 1900 census, Bishop's occupation was given as an unemployed music teacher. She was 23 at the time, born in West Virginia in September 1876. The Ethel Bishop hypothesis neatly combines, in one person, the speculations that she was a schoolteacher, and the one that she was a prostitute.{{sfn|Meadows|1996|p=36}}\n\n====Ann Bassett====\nAnother conjecture is that she was a [[cattle rustler]] named [[Ann Bassett]] (1878\u20131956) who knew and ran with the Wild Bunch at the turn of the 20th century. Both Bassett and Place were attractive women, with similar facial features, body frame, and hair color. Bassett was born in 1878, the same year Place was thought to have been born. Dr. Thomas G. Kyle of the Computer Research Group at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], who performed many photographic comparisons for government intelligence agencies, conducted a series of tests on photographs of Etta Place and Ann Bassett. Both had the same [[scar]] or [[cowlick]] at the top of their forehead. Dr. Kyle concluded that there could be no reasonable doubt they were the same person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/justwhowastheoutlawqueenettaplace.html |title=Just Who Was the Outlaw Queen Etta Place? |last=Reeve |first=W.

Several documents prove that Bassett was in Wyoming during much of the time when Place was in South America. Bassett was arrested and briefly incarcerated in Utah for rustling cattle in 1903 while Place was in South America with Longabaugh and Parker. Bassett also married her first husband in Utah that year, and therefore, could not have been in South America during that time.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.criminalelement.com/the-mysterious-disappearance-of-etta-place |title=The Mysterious Disappearance of Etta Place |last=Hays |first=Tony |date=14 August 2011 |work=CriminalElement}}</ref>\n\n====Eunice Gray====\nA once popular theory held that she was [[Eunice Gray]], who for many years operated a brothel in Fort Worth, Texas, and later ran the Waco Hotel there until she died in a fire in January 1962. Gray once told Delbert Willis of the ''[[Fort Worth Press]]'', \"I've lived in Fort Worth since 1901. That is except for the time I had to high-tail it out of town. Went to South America for a few years ... until things settled down.\" Willis conceded that Gray never claimed to be Etta Place; he merely made that connection on his own, given the similarities in their ages, and the period in which Gray said she was in South America coinciding with Place's time there. Gray was described as a beautiful woman, and Willis believed that Place and Gray held a striking resemblance to one another, but there were no known photographs of Gray from that period to compare with Place's.  In 2007, amateur genealogist Donna Donnell found Eunice Gray on a 1911 passenger list from Panama. Following that lead, she tracked down Gray's niece, who had two photographs of her: one taken at her high school graduation circa 1896, and another from sometime in the 1920s. Comparing those photos to Place's, both agreed that Eunice Gray was definitely not Etta Place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genealogue.com/2007/03/womans-face-proves-shes-no-place.html |title=Woman's Face Proves She's No Place |work=The Genealogue |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Madaline Wilson====\nYet another theory suggests that Place was actually Madaline Wilson, another girl in Fannie Porter's brothel. Sleuth Tony Hays notes that of the five girls in Fannie's \u201cboarding house,\" all were born around 1878\u201380. One girl, 22-year-old Wilson, appeared in the 1900 census records of Bexar County, Texas, immediately beneath Madame Porter's name. Like Porter, Wilson was listed as being of English birth, immigrating to the United States in 1884 at the age of six. Hays theorizes that Wilson changed her name, and that her British accent, tempered by 16 years in America, might be described as \"refined.\" All traces of Wilson disappeared after the 1900 census after Place and Longabaugh left town.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Life after Longabaugh===\nThere is still considerable debate over when Place's relationship with Longabaugh ended. Some claims indicate that Place ended her relationship with Longabaugh and returned to the United States before his death. Others believe that the two remained romantically involved, and that she simply tired of life in South America. By 1907, she was known to have been living in San Francisco, but after that, she vanished without a trace.\n\nIn 1909, a woman matching Place's description asked Frank Aller (US Vice-Consul in Antofagasta, Chile) for assistance in obtaining a death certificate for Longabaugh. No such certificate was issued, and the woman's identity was never ascertained.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacKell |first=Jan |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIpSl6MJoFMC&lpg=PA333&pg=PA333#v=onepage |title=Red Light Women of the Rocky Mountains |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0826346103 |p=333}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Richard Llewellyn claimed that while in Argentina he found indications that Place had moved to Paraguay following the death of Longabaugh, and that she had married a wealthy man. There also were rumors that Etta Place was in fact Edith Mae, wife of famous boxing promoter [[Tex Rickard]], who retired to a ranch in Paraguay shortly after promoting the famous fight between [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[James J. Jeffries|Jim Jeffries]] in 1910.\n\nA Pinkerton report states that a woman matching Place's description was killed in a shootout resulting from a domestic dispute with a man named Mateo Gebhart in Chubut, Argentina, in March 1922. Another report claims she committed suicide in 1924 in Argentina, and yet another states that she died of natural causes in 1966.\n\nThere have been various additional claims about her life after the death of Longabaugh. Some believe that she returned to New York City, while other theories suggest she moved back to Texas and started a new life there. One claim is that she returned to her life as a schoolteacher, living the remainder of her life in Denver, Colorado, and another story says she lived the remainder of her life teaching in [[Marion, Oregon]]. There are also various claims that she returned to prostitution, living the remainder of her life in Texas, California or New York. However, these claims are mere speculation, without any supporting evidence.\n\nAuthor and researcher Larry Pointer, author of the 1977 book ''In Search of Butch Cassidy'', wrote that Place's identity and fate are \"one of the most intriguing riddles in western history. Leads develop only to dissolve into ambiguity.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3Bhkad9SwoC |last=Pointer |first=Larry |year=1977 |title=In Search of Butch Cassidy |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0806114552}}</ref>\n\n==Fact timelines generally accepted by historians==\n* 1899\u20131900: Place was living in Texas and being courted by Harry A. Longabaugh, also known as the Sundance Kid. Some stories claim Place was a housekeeper or possibly a prostitute in Fannie Porter's sporting house during this time.\n* December 1900: Place and Longabaugh reportedly marry, he using the alias Harry A. Place, shortly after he is photographed in the famous [[:File:Wildbunchlarge.jpg|Fort Worth Five photo]].

''Soldier Prince'' from Argentina to New York City. Pinkerton detectives find evidence that Place was homesick and wanting to visit her family, but were unable to identify who her family was.\n* April 2, 1902: Longabaugh and Place register at Mrs. Thompson's Boarding House in New York City, and visit members of his family in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], then visit [[Coney Island]].\n* July 10, 1902: Place and Longabaugh pose as stewards and sail on the steamer ''Honorius'' back to Argentina.\n* August 9, 1902: Place registers them at the Hotel Europa in Buenos Aires.\n* Early to late 1903: Parker's former lover Ann Bassett marries a rancher by the name of Henry Bernard, and shortly thereafter is arrested for rustling.\n* Summer 1904: Place and Longabaugh sail again to New York City to visit her family. Once again Pinkerton detectives discover she is homesick, but cannot discover the identity of her family.\n* May 1, 1905: Place, Longabaugh, and Parker decide to sell their ranch in [[Cholila, Argentina]], and leave South America to avoid the law there. Longabaugh and Place sail to [[San Francisco]], where she remains, and he returns to South America.\n* 1907: Place is living alone in San Francisco, and there is no evidence she has seen Longabaugh since his departure two years prior.\n* July 31, 1909: A woman matching Place's description attempts to obtain a death certificate following Longabaugh's death in [[Bolivia]] so that she can settle his estate. She disappears from all historical records after that. With Longabaugh dead, Pinkerton's interest in her location wanes, and her trail goes cold.\n\n==Media depictions==\n* In the 1969 film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', Etta Place is depicted as a schoolteacher. Screenwriter [[William Goldman]] was suspicious of claims that Place was a prostitute; he believed she was too attractive and vibrant to have worked as a prostitute, a profession that tended to age women prematurely and tax their health.<ref>See the 2001 History Channel documentary ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time''.</ref> Place was portrayed in the film by [[Katharine Ross]].\n* [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] portrayed Etta Place in ''Mrs. Sundance'', a highly fictionalized 1974 television movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071868/ |title=Mrs. Sundance (TV Movie 1974) |date=15 January 1974 |work=IMDb}}</ref>\n* [[Katharine Ross]] reprised her role as Etta Place in ''Wanted: The Sundance Woman'', a fictional 1976 made-for-television movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075412/ |title=Wanted: The Sundance Woman (TV Movie 1976) |date=1 October 1976 |work=IMDb}}</ref>\n* In the 1994 TV movie ''The Gambler V: Playing for Keeps'', Etta Place is played by [[Mariska Hargitay]].\n* In the 2004 TV movie ''[[The Legend of Butch & Sundance]]'', [[Rachelle Lefevre]] portrays Etta Place.\n* Etta Place was played by [[Dominique McElligott]] in the 2011 film ''[[Blackthorn (film)|Blackthorn]]''.\n* Etta Place was the central character in ''Etta: A Novel'' by Gerald Kolpan, published in 2009 by Ballantine Books.<ref>{{cite web |last=Oldenburg |first=Don |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/06/28/gerald-kolpans-novel-doesnt-do-justice-to-the-outlaw-etta/2469107/ |title=Gerald Kolpan's novel doesn't do justice to the outlaw Etta |work=[[USA Today]] |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Outlaw]]s\n* [[American Old West]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Answer Man: Mysterious Etta Place'' by Chuck Parsons\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080216070245/http://www.sundancekidhenrylong.com/ Etta Place] at ''Sundance Kid and Henry Long''\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Place, Etta}}\n[[Category:1870s births]]\n[[Category:People from Texas]]\n[[Category:American folklore]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:American emigrants to Argentina]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch]]\n", "name_user": "Simon d", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEthel Bishop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etta_Place"}

The album includes several of the group's singles and [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s from 1963 and 1964. Included are the group's first [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Pop Singles]] number-one hits, \"[[Where Did Our Love Go]]\", \"[[Baby Love]]\", and \"[[Come See About Me]]\", as well as their first Top 40 hit, \"[[When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes]]\", and the singles \"[[A Breathtaking Guy]]\" and \"[[Run, Run, Run (The Supremes song)|Run, Run, Run]]\".\n\nWith the release of this album, The Supremes became the first act in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] history to have three number-one hits from the same album. It was the album that introduced \"The Motown Sound\" to the masses.  It was also, at the time, the highest-ranking album by an all-female group. It remained in the #2 position for 4 consecutive weeks in January 1965, shut out of the top spot by the Beatles' blockbuster ''[[Beatles '65]]'' album. ''Where Did Our Love Go'' remained on the Billboard album chart for an unprecedented 89 weeks. According to Motown data, the album ultimately sold over 3,000,000 copies. This album was also the first ever number one album on Billboard's R&B album chart in January 1965.\n\nHip-O Select released a limited run fortieth anniversary deluxe edition of the album in 2004, which included both the mono and stereo versions of the album, as well as several outtakes, non-album tracks and a recorded live show from the Twenty Grand club in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. It sold out immediately. (see: Hip-O Select.com)\n\nThey filmed performances of four of the singles from the album including \"[[Run, Run, Run (The Supremes song)|Run, Run, Run]]\",  \"[[When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes]]\", \"[[Where Did Our Love Go]]\" and \"[[Baby Love]]\" for the concert film, ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'' released on December 29, 1964. It was equivalent to [[Motown 25]] or [[Live Aid]] as a pivotal music concert event {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

The album includes several of the group's singles and [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s from 1963 and 1964. Included are the group's first [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Pop Singles]] number-one hits, \"[[Where Did Our Love Go]]\", \"[[Baby Love]]\", and \"[[Come See About Me]]\", as well as their first Top 40 hit, \"[[When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes]]\", and the singles \"[[A Breathtaking Guy]]\" and \"[[Run, Run, Run (The Supremes song)|Run, Run, Run]]\".\n\nWith the release of this album, The Supremes became the first act in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] history to have three number-one hits from the same album. It was the album that introduced \"The Motown Sound\" to the masses.  It was also, at the time, the highest-ranking album by an all-female group. It remained in the #2 position for 4 consecutive weeks in January 1965, shut out of the top spot by the Beatles' blockbuster ''[[Beatles '65]]'' album. ''Where Did Our Love Go'' remained on the Billboard album chart for an unprecedented 89 weeks. According to Motown data, the album ultimately sold over 3,000,000 copies. This album was also the first ever number one album on Billboard's R&B album chart in January 1965.\n\nHip-O Select released a limited run fortieth anniversary deluxe edition of the album in 2004, which included both the mono and stereo versions of the album, as well as several outtakes, non-album tracks and a recorded live show from the Twenty Grand club in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. It sold out immediately. (see: Hip-O Select.com)\n\nThey filmed performances of four of the singles from the album including \"[[Run, Run, Run (The Supremes song)|Run, Run, Run]]\",  \"[[When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes]]\", \"[[Where Did Our Love Go]]\" and \"[[Baby Love]]\" for the concert film, ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'' released on December 29, 1964. It was equivalent to [[Motown 25]] or [[Live Aid]] as a pivotal music concert event {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

Common clinical classification systems for esthesioneuroblastoma include the Kadish classification and the Dulguerov classification. Histopathological characteristics on top of Kadish classification can further determine cancer prognosis. In severe, Kadish class C tumors, Haym's grades of pathology are important for prognosis. Patients with low grade Kadish class C tumors have a 10-year survival rate of 86 percent compared to patients with high grade class C tumors who have a survival rate of 28 percent.<ref name=\"kaur1\"/> Surgically treated patients with high grade tumors are more likely to experience [[leptomeningeal]] metastases or involvement of the [[cerebral spinal fluid]] unlike patients with low grade tumors who usually only see local recurrence.<ref>Malouf GG, Casiraghi O, Deutsch E, Guigay J, Temam S, Bourhis J.
