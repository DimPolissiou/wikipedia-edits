The episode aired on March 16, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\nMike wakes on a ranch just inside the Mexican border which is owned by Gus and includes a fountain dedicated to [[Maximino Arciniega|Max]]. Mike finds his stab wounds were treated by [[Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]] who cautions him to heal for a week while in the care of Senora Cortazar before attempting to return to Albuquerque. Mike calls Gus to learn his intent, but Gus hangs up on him. Days later, Gus arrives in person and asks for Mike's help. Mike refuses to become a \"[[Contract killing|button man]]\" and engage in killing simply to further Gus's war against the Salamancas, but Gus says he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge.\n\nHoward phones Jimmy and inquires if he has considered Howard's offer to join HHM; Jimmy claims he is still thinking it over. Jimmy as Saul creates delays in Mesa Verde's eviction of Everett Acker, including changing Acker's street number and claiming the eviction notices are for the wrong address, creating fake Native American artifacts, planting low-level radioactive material, and passing off a spray-painted image of Jesus on Acker's home as a miracle to hundreds of tourists and religious faithful. Kim tries to remove herself from the case by claiming a conflict of interest due to Jimmy's involvement, but Kevin insists she remain. As matters relating to Acker's eviction arrive at Schweikart & Cokely, Kim assigns them to the firm's associates, claiming they have expertise that she does not. Facing further delays, Rich encourages Kevin to follow Kim's plan to locate the Mesa Verde call center at an alternate site, but Kevin adamantly demands Acker's eviction.\n\nKim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could find \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also counsels against doing it. Kim decides to proceed against Kevin, and Jimmy agrees. After Mike refuses the job, Jimmy hires [[Pimento (Better Call Saul)|Sobchak]], who surveils Kevin and surreptitiously searches his house. Sobchak tells Jimmy and Kim that his search of Kevin's home revealed nothing damaging. Jimmy dismisses Sobchak from their meeting at his office in the nail salon after Sobchak's half-serious recommendations for what to do next include kidnapping and murder. Kim's knowing smile as she looks through Sobchak's photos indicates she has found something she can use against Kevin. The next day Rich suggests to Kim that she temporarily disengage from all Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\n==Production==\nOn the ''Better Call Saul Insider'' podcast, showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] said of Mike's scenes in this episode were partially inspired by the television show ''[[The Prisoner]]''. Gould said that while Mike was not trapped on Gus' villa as with ''The Prisoner'', the idea of being stuck in one place and using that as a form of self-reflection helped move Mike's character from what was established within ''Better Call Saul'' toward what audiences had come to know within ''Breaking Bad'', through Gus showing Mike a more personal side while standing next to the fountain that reminds Gus of Max.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/better-call-saul-creator-peter-gould-explains-why-gus-fring-sent-mike-to-mexico.html/ |title='Better Call Saul' Creator Peter Gould Explains Why Gus Fring Sent Mike to Mexico |first=Fred |last=Topel |date=March 19, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=Cheat Sheet}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\"Dedicado a Max\" was well received by critics.

Marine life depends in some way on the [[seawater|saltwater]] that is in the sea (the term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an [[ecological]] or [[Natural environment|environmental]] area inhabited by one or more living  [[species]].<ref name=\"Dickinson 63\">Dickinson, C.I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds.'' The Kew Series</ref><ref name=\" Abercrombie 66\">Abercrombie, M., Hickman, C.J. and Johnson, M.L. 1966.''A Dictionary of Biology.'' Penguin Reference Books, London</ref> The marine environment supports many kinds of these habitats.\n\nMarine habitats can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the [[shoreline]] out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven per cent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.\n\nAlternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] and [[demersal zone]]s. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.\n\nMarine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like [[coral]]s, [[kelp]], [[mangrove]]s and [[seagrass]]es, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms. By volume the ocean provides most of the habitable space on the planet.<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/living-ocean Living Ocean] ''NASA Science''.

The rest is ocean, home to the marine habitats. The oceans are nearly four kilometres deep on average and are fringed with coastlines that run for nearly 380,000 kilometres.|alt=Two views of the ocean from space]]\n\nIn contrast to terrestrial habitats, marine habitats are shifting and ephemeral. Swimming organisms find areas by the edge of a [[continental shelf]] a good habitat, but only while [[upwelling]]s bring nutrient rich water to the surface. Shellfish find habitat on sandy beaches, but storms, tides and currents mean their habitat continually reinvents itself.\n\nThe presence of [[seawater]] is common to all marine habitats. Beyond that many other things determine whether a marine area makes a good habitat and the type of habitat it makes. For example:\n* temperature \u2013 is affected by geographical [[latitude]], [[ocean currents]], [[weather]], the discharge of rivers, and by the presence of [[hydrothermal vent]]s or [[cold seep]]s\n* sunlight \u2013 [[photosynthetic]] processes depend on how deep and [[turbid]] the water is\n* nutrients \u2013 are transported by ocean currents to different marine habitats from [[land runoff]], or by upwellings from the deep sea, or they sink through the sea as [[marine snow]]\n* salinity \u2013 varies, particularly in [[estuaries]] or near [[river delta]]s, or by hydrothermal vents\n* dissolved gases \u2013 oxygen levels in particular, can be increased by wave actions and decreased during [[algal bloom]]s\n* acidity \u2013 this is partly to do with dissolved gases above, since the acidity of the ocean is largely controlled by how much carbon dioxide is in the water.\n* turbulence \u2013  [[ocean wave]]s, fast currents and the agitation of water affect the nature of habitats\n* cover \u2013 the availability of cover such as the adjacency of the [[Benthic zone|sea bottom]], or the presence of [[Pelagic fish#Floating objects|floating objects]]\n* the occupying organisms themselves \u2013 since organisms modify their habitats by the act of occupying them, and some, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, create further habitats for other organisms.\n\nThere are five major oceans, of which the [[Pacific Ocean]] is nearly as large as the rest put together. Coastlines fringe the land for nearly 380,000 kilometres.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ocean\n! Area<br />million km<sup>2</sup>\n! %\n!

If the current carries the right nutrients, and if it also flows at a suitably shallow depth where there is plenty of sunlight, then such a current itself can become a suitable habitat for photosynthesizing tiny algae called [[phytoplankton]]. These tiny plants are the [[Primary production|primary producers]] in the ocean, at the start of the [[food chain]]. In turn, as the population of drifting phytoplankton grows, the water becomes a suitable habitat for [[zooplankton]], which feed on the phytoplankton. While phytoplankton are tiny drifting plants, zooplankton are tiny drifting animals, such as the [[larvae]] of [[fish]] and [[marine invertebrate]]s. If sufficient zooplankton establish themselves, the current becomes a candidate habitat for the [[forage fish]] that feed on them. And then if sufficient forage fish move to the area, it becomes a candidate habitat for larger [[predatory fish]] and other marine animals that feed on the forage fish. In this dynamic way, the current itself can, over time, become a moving habitat for multiple types of marine life.\n\n[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|This [[algae bloom]] occupies sunlit [[epipelagic]] waters off the southern coast of England. The algae are maybe feeding on nutrients from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the edge of the continental shelf]]\n\nOcean currents can be generated by differences in the density of the water. How dense water is depends on how saline or warm it is. If water contains differences in salt content or temperature, then the different densities will initiate a current. Water that is saltier or cooler will be denser, and will sink in relation to the surrounding water. Conversely, warmer and less salty water will float to the surface. Atmospheric winds and pressure differences also produces surface currents, [[Ocean wave|waves]] and [[seiche]]s. Ocean currents are also generated by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon ([[tide]]s), and seismic activity ([[tsunami]]).<ref name=\"Marietta Ocean\" />\n\nThe rotation of the Earth affects the direction ocean currents take, and explains which way the large circular [[ocean gyre]]s rotate in the image above left. Suppose a current at the equator is heading north. The Earth rotates eastward, so the water possesses that rotational momentum. But the further the water moves north, the slower the earth moves eastward. If the current could get to the North Pole, the earth wouldn't be moving eastward at all. To conserve its rotational momentum, the further the current travels north the faster it must move eastward. So the effect is that the current curves to the right. This is the [[Coriolis effect]]. It is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. The effect is opposite south of the equator, where currents curve left.<ref name=\"Marietta Ocean\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Marine topography==\n[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|300px|Map of underwater topography (1995 [[NOAA]])]]\n{{see also|Bathymetry|Ocean surface topography}}\n\nMarine (or seabed or ocean) [[topography]] refers to the shape the land has when it interfaces with the ocean. These shapes are obvious along coastlines, but they occur also in significant ways underwater. The effectiveness of marine habitats is partially defined by these shapes, including the way they interact with and shape [[ocean current]]s, and the way sunlight diminishes when these landforms occupy increasing depths. Tidal networks depend on the balance between sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics however, anthropogenic influences can impact the natural system more than any physical driver.<ref>Giovanni Coco, Z.

The Earth's natural processes, including [[weather]] and [[sea level rise|sea level change]], result in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and resculpturing of coasts as well as the flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[drowned river valley]]s.\n\nThe main agents responsible for deposition and [[erosion]] along coastlines are [[wind wave|waves]], [[tide]]s and [[Ocean current|currents]]. The formation of coasts also depends on the [[lithology|nature of the rocks]] they are made of \u2013 the harder the rocks the less likely they are to erode, so variations in rock hardness result in coastlines with different shapes.\n\n[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.<ref>Davidson (2002), p.421.</ref>\n\nWaves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.<ref>Easterbrook (1999).</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = <center>''Shores that look permanent through the short perceptive of a human lifetime are in fact among the most temporary of all marine structures.''<ref name=\"Garrison\">Garrison T (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xvilxa1pz1wC&pg=PA343&dq=%22primary+coasts%22+%22secondary+coasts%22&hl=en&ei=CqqqTdD7PIimugPHgMmUCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22primary%20coasts%22%20%22secondary%20coasts%22&f=false ''Oceanography: an invitation to marine science''] Cengage Learning, Page 343. {{ISBN|978-0-495-11286-0}}</ref></center>\n| width = 160px\n| align = right}}\n\nThe [[Sedimentology|sedimentologist]] [[Francis Shepard]] classified coasts as ''primary'' or ''secondary''.<ref name=\"Shepard\">Shepard FP (1937) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30056777 Revised \"Classification of Marine Shorelines\"] ''The Journal of Geology,'' '''45'''(6): 602\u2013624.</ref>\n\n* Primary coasts are shaped by non-marine processes, by changes in the land form.

This means the conditions for [[photosynthetic]] processes so important for [[primary production]], are available to coastal marine habitats. Because land is nearby, there are large discharges of nutrient rich [[land runoff]] into coastal waters. Further, periodic [[upwelling]]s from the deep ocean can provide cool and nutrient rich currents along the edge of the continental shelf.\n\nAs a result, coastal marine life is the most abundant in the world. It is found in [[tidal pool]]s, [[fjord]]s and [[estuaries]], near sandy shores and rocky coastlines, around [[coral reef]]s and on or above the continental shelf. [[Coastal fish]] include small forage fish as well as the larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. [[Forage fish]] thrive in inshore waters where high [[Primary production|productivity]] results from [[upwelling]] and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.<ref name=\"Moyle572\">Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 572</ref> There can also be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] between species that occupy adjacent marine habitats. For example, [[fringing reef]]s just below [[low tide]] level have a mutually beneficial relationship with [[mangrove]] forests at high tide level and [[sea grass]] meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or [[erosion|erode]] the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of [[silt]], fresh water and [[pollution|pollutants]]. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.<ref>{{cite book\n| author=Hatcher, B.G.

A huge array of life lives within this zone.\n\nShore habitats range from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].\n\n===Sandy shores===\n[[File:The White Rocks near Portrush (1) - geograph.org.uk - 785899.jpg|thumb|right|Sandy shores provide shifting homes to many species]]\n{{see also|Beach}}\n\nSandy shores, also called [[beach]]es, are coastal shorelines where [[sand]] accumulates.

By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting [[sand dune]]s.

Many animals also [[burrowing|burrow]] to avoid [[predation]] and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux. [[Phytoplankton]] are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the [[tide]]s. Their productivity is largely dependent on the [[turbidity]] of the water. The main phytoplankton present are [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]] which are abundant in the sediment.\n\n===Kelp forests===\n{{further|Kelp forest}}\n[[File:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kelp forest]]s provide habitat for many marine organisms]]\n\n[[Kelp forest]]s are underwater areas with a high density of [[kelp]].

Ecology 78: 1946-1957.</ref> In algae (Kingdom: [[Protista]]), the body of an individual organism is known as a [[thallus]] rather than as a plant (Kingdom: [[Plantae]]). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:<ref name=\"Dayton 1985a\"/>\n:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus;\n:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features;\n:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.\nIn addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.\n\nThe environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose > 50 E m<sup>\u22122</sup><ref name=\"Druehl 1981\">Druehl, L.D. 1981.

Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic [[upwelling]], a process that delivers cool nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean's [[mixed layer|mixed surface layer]].<ref name=\"Druehl 1981\"/> Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column.<ref>Wheeler, W.N. 1980.

They are called ''seagrasses'' because the leaves are long and narrow and are very often green, and because the plants often grow in large meadows which look like grassland. Since seagrasses [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and are submerged, they must grow submerged in the [[photic zone]], where there is enough sunlight. For this reason, most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms.\n\nSeagrasses form extensive beds or meadows, which can be either monospecific (made up of one species) or multispecific (where more than one species co-exist). Seagrass beds make highly diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s. They are home to [[phylum|phyla]] such as juvenile and adult fish, [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] and free-living [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] and [[Microphyte|microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s.  Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific [[review]]s and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is a highly important link in the food chain, with hundreds of species feeding on seagrasses worldwide, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s.\n\nSeagrasses are [[ecosystem engineer]]s in the sense that they partly create their own habitat. The leaves slow down water-currents increasing [[sedimentation]], and the seagrass [[root]]s and [[rhizome]]s stabilize the seabed. Their importance to associated species is mainly due to provision of shelter (through their three-dimensional structure in the water column), and due to their extraordinarily high rate of [[primary production]]. As a result, seagrasses provide coastal zones with [[ecosystem services]], such as [[fishing ground]]s, [[Wind wave|wave]] protection, [[oxygen]] production and protection against coastal [[erosion]]. Seagrass meadows account for 15% of the ocean's total carbon storage.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=To Save the Planet, Save the Seas\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/opinion/27lafolley.html?ref=opinion\n|last=Laffoley |first=Dan\n|date=December 26, 2009\n|accessdate=December 2009\n |work=The New York Times\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Coral reefs ===\n[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|right]]\n{{Main|Coral reef}}\n{{See also|Coral reef fish}}\n\n[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.\n\nMuch attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] weather phenomenon.

The waters down to about 200 metres are said to be in the [[epipelagic zone]]. Enough sunlight enters the epipelagic zone to allow [[photosynthesis]] by [[phytoplankton]]. The epipelagic zone is usually low in nutrients. This partially because the organic debris produced in the zone, such as excrement and dead animals, sink to the depths and are lost to the upper zone.

In deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The \"snowflakes\" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nSome deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s and over [[continental slope]]s.

Marine life depends in some way on the [[seawater|saltwater]] that is in the sea (the term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an [[ecological]] or [[Natural environment|environmental]] area inhabited by one or more living  [[species]].<ref name=\"Dickinson 63\">Dickinson, C.I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds.'' The Kew Series</ref><ref name=\"Abercrombie 66\">Abercrombie, M., Hickman, C.J. and Johnson, M.L. 1966.''A Dictionary of Biology.'' Penguin Reference Books, London</ref> The marine environment supports many kinds of these habitats.\n\nMarine habitats can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the [[shoreline]] out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.\n\nAlternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] and [[demersal zone]]s. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.\n\nMarine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like [[coral]]s, [[kelp]], [[mangrove]]s and [[seagrass]]es, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms. By volume the ocean provides most of the habitable space on the planet.<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/living-ocean Living Ocean] ''NASA Science''.

The rest is ocean, home to the marine habitats. The oceans are nearly four kilometres deep on average and are fringed with coastlines that run for nearly 380,000 kilometres.|alt=Two views of the ocean from space]]\n\nIn contrast to terrestrial habitats, marine habitats are shifting and ephemeral. Swimming organisms find areas by the edge of a [[continental shelf]] a good habitat, but only while [[upwelling]]s bring nutrient rich water to the surface. Shellfish find habitat on sandy beaches, but storms, tides and currents mean their habitat continually reinvents itself.\n\nThe presence of [[seawater]] is common to all marine habitats. Beyond that many other things determine whether a marine area makes a good habitat and the type of habitat it makes. For example:\n* temperature \u2013 is affected by geographical [[latitude]], [[ocean currents]], [[weather]], the discharge of rivers, and by the presence of [[hydrothermal vent]]s or [[cold seep]]s\n* sunlight \u2013 [[photosynthetic]] processes depend on how deep and [[turbid]] the water is\n* nutrients \u2013 are transported by ocean currents to different marine habitats from [[land runoff]], or by upwellings from the deep sea, or they sink through the sea as [[marine snow]]\n* salinity \u2013 varies, particularly in [[estuaries]] or near [[river delta]]s, or by hydrothermal vents\n* dissolved gases \u2013 oxygen levels in particular, can be increased by wave actions and decreased during [[algal bloom]]s\n* acidity \u2013 this is partly to do with dissolved gases above, since the acidity of the ocean is largely controlled by how much carbon dioxide is in the water.\n* turbulence \u2013  [[ocean wave]]s, fast currents and the agitation of water affect the nature of habitats\n* cover \u2013 the availability of cover such as the adjacency of the [[Benthic zone|sea bottom]], or the presence of [[Pelagic fish#Floating objects|floating objects]]\n* the occupying organisms themselves \u2013 since organisms modify their habitats by the act of occupying them, and some, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, create further habitats for other organisms.\n\nThere are five major oceans, of which the [[Pacific Ocean]] is nearly as large as the rest put together. Coastlines fringe the land for nearly 380,000 kilometres.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Ocean\n! Area<br />million km<sup>2</sup>\n! %\n!

If the current carries the right nutrients, and if it also flows at a suitably shallow depth where there is plenty of sunlight, then such a current itself can become a suitable habitat for photosynthesizing tiny algae called [[phytoplankton]]. These tiny plants are the [[Primary production|primary producers]] in the ocean, at the start of the [[food chain]]. In turn, as the population of drifting phytoplankton grows, the water becomes a suitable habitat for [[zooplankton]], which feed on the phytoplankton. While phytoplankton are tiny drifting plants, zooplankton are tiny drifting animals, such as the [[larvae]] of [[fish]] and [[marine invertebrate]]s. If sufficient zooplankton establish themselves, the current becomes a candidate habitat for the [[forage fish]] that feed on them. And then if sufficient forage fish move to the area, it becomes a candidate habitat for larger [[predatory fish]] and other marine animals that feed on the forage fish. In this dynamic way, the current itself can, over time, become a moving habitat for multiple types of marine life.\n\n[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|This [[algae bloom]] occupies sunlit [[epipelagic]] waters off the southern coast of England. The algae are maybe feeding on nutrients from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the edge of the continental shelf]]\n\nOcean currents can be generated by differences in the density of the water. How dense water is depends on how saline or warm it is. If water contains differences in salt content or temperature, then the different densities will initiate a current. Water that is saltier or cooler will be denser, and will sink in relation to the surrounding water. Conversely, warmer and less salty water will float to the surface. Atmospheric winds and pressure differences also produces surface currents, [[Ocean wave|waves]] and [[seiche]]s. Ocean currents are also generated by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon ([[tide]]s), and seismic activity ([[tsunami]]).<ref name=\"Marietta Ocean\" />\n\nThe rotation of the Earth affects the direction ocean currents take, and explains which way the large circular [[ocean gyre]]s rotate in the image above left. Suppose a current at the equator is heading north. The Earth rotates eastward, so the water possesses that rotational momentum. But the further the water moves north, the slower the earth moves eastward. If the current could get to the North Pole, the earth wouldn't be moving eastward at all. To conserve its rotational momentum, the further the current travels north the faster it must move eastward. So the effect is that the current curves to the right. This is the [[Coriolis effect]]. It is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. The effect is opposite south of the equator, where currents curve left.<ref name=\"Marietta Ocean\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Marine topography==\n[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|300px|Map of underwater topography (1995 [[NOAA]])]]\n{{see also|Bathymetry|Ocean surface topography}}\n\nMarine (or seabed or ocean) [[topography]] refers to the shape the land has when it interfaces with the ocean. These shapes are obvious along coastlines, but they occur also in significant ways underwater. The effectiveness of marine habitats is partially defined by these shapes, including the way they interact with and shape [[ocean current]]s, and the way sunlight diminishes when these landforms occupy increasing depths. Tidal networks depend on the balance between sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics however, anthropogenic influences can impact the natural system more than any physical driver.<ref>Giovanni Coco, Z.

The Earth's natural processes, including [[weather]] and [[sea level rise|sea level change]], result in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and resculpturing of coasts as well as the flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[drowned river valley]]s.\n\nThe main agents responsible for deposition and [[erosion]] along coastlines are [[wind wave|waves]], [[tide]]s and [[Ocean current|currents]]. The formation of coasts also depends on the [[lithology|nature of the rocks]] they are made of \u2013 the harder the rocks the less likely they are to erode, so variations in rock hardness result in coastlines with different shapes.\n\n[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.<ref>Davidson (2002), p.421.</ref>\n\nWaves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves.

This means the conditions for [[photosynthetic]] processes so important for [[primary production]], are available to coastal marine habitats. Because land is nearby, there are large discharges of nutrient rich [[land runoff]] into coastal waters. Further, periodic [[upwelling]]s from the deep ocean can provide cool and nutrient rich currents along the edge of the continental shelf.\n\nAs a result, coastal marine life is the most abundant in the world. It is found in [[tidal pool]]s, [[fjord]]s and [[estuaries]], near sandy shores and rocky coastlines, around [[coral reef]]s and on or above the continental shelf. [[Coastal fish]] include small forage fish as well as the larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. [[Forage fish]] thrive in inshore waters where high [[Primary production|productivity]] results from [[upwelling]] and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.<ref name=\"Moyle572\">Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 572</ref> There can also be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] between species that occupy adjacent marine habitats.

This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.<ref>{{cite book\n| author=Hatcher, B.G.

Waves and currents shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. [[Longshore current]]s flow parallel to the beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand. These currents transport large amounts of sand along coasts, forming [[Spit (landform)|spits]], [[barrier island]]s and [[tombolo]]s.

This small particle size means that mud particles tend to stick together, whereas sand particles do not. Mud is not easily shifted by waves and currents, and when it dries out, cakes into a solid. By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting [[sand dune]]s. Beyond the high tide mark, if the beach is low-lying, the wind can form rolling hills of sand dunes. Small dunes shift and reshape under the influence of the wind while larger dunes stabilise the sand with vegetation.<ref name=\"Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics\" />\n\nOcean processes grade loose sediments to [[Particle size (grain size)|particle sizes]] other than sand, such as [[gravel]] or [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]s.

Many animals also [[burrowing|burrow]] to avoid [[predation]] and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux. [[Phytoplankton]] are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the [[tide]]s.

The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:<ref name=\"Dayton 1985a\"/>\n:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus;\n:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features;\n:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.\nIn addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.\n\nThe environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose > 50 E m<sup>\u22122</sup><ref name=\"Druehl 1981\">Druehl, L.D. 1981.

Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic [[upwelling]], a process that delivers cool nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean's [[mixed layer|mixed surface layer]].<ref name=\"Druehl 1981\"/> Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column.<ref>Wheeler, W.N. 1980.

They are called ''seagrasses'' because the leaves are long and narrow and are very often green, and because the plants often grow in large meadows which look like grassland. Since seagrasses [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and are submerged, they must grow submerged in the [[photic zone]], where there is enough sunlight. For this reason, most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms.\n\nSeagrasses form extensive beds or meadows, which can be either monospecific (made up of one species) or multispecific (where more than one species co-exist). Seagrass beds make highly diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s. They are home to [[phylum|phyla]] such as juvenile and adult fish, [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] and free-living [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] and [[Microphyte|microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s.  Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific [[review]]s and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is a highly important link in the food chain, with hundreds of species feeding on seagrasses worldwide, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s.\n\nSeagrasses are [[ecosystem engineer]]s in the sense that they partly create their own habitat. The leaves slow down water-currents increasing [[sedimentation]], and the seagrass [[root]]s and [[rhizome]]s stabilize the seabed. Their importance to associated species is mainly due to provision of shelter (through their three-dimensional structure in the water column), and due to their extraordinarily high rate of [[primary production]]. As a result, seagrasses provide coastal zones with [[ecosystem services]], such as [[fishing ground]]s, [[Wind wave|wave]] protection, [[oxygen]] production and protection against coastal [[erosion]]. Seagrass meadows account for 15% of the ocean's total carbon storage.<ref>{{cite news\n|title=To Save the Planet, Save the Seas\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/opinion/27lafolley.html?ref=opinion\n|last=Laffoley |first=Dan\n|date=December 26, 2009\n|accessdate=December 2009\n |work=The New York Times\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Coral reefs ===\n[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|right]]\n{{Main|Coral reef}}\n{{See also|Coral reef fish}}\n\n[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world.

Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.\n\nMuch attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] weather phenomenon.

Only about 10 percent of marine species live in the open ocean. But among them are the largest and fastest of all marine animals, as well as the animals that dive the deepest and migrate the longest. In the depths lurk animal that, to our eyes, appear hugely alien.<ref>[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/ Blue Planet: Open ocean] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.</ref>\n\n===Surface waters===\n[[File:Starr 061214-2478 Chenopodium oahuense.jpg|thumb|right|In the open ocean, sunlit surface [[epipelagic]] waters get enough light for photosynthesis, but there are often not enough nutrients. As a result, large areas contain little life apart from migrating animals.<ref name=sunlit />]]\n\nThe surface waters are sunlit. The waters down to about 200 metres are said to be in the [[epipelagic zone]]. Enough sunlight enters the epipelagic zone to allow [[photosynthesis]] by [[phytoplankton]]. The epipelagic zone is usually low in nutrients. This partially because the organic debris produced in the zone, such as excrement and dead animals, sink to the depths and are lost to the upper zone. Photosynthesis can happen only if both sunlight and nutrients are present.<ref name=sunlit>[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/surface_waters/ Ocean ecology: sunlit surface waters] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn some places, like at the edge of continental shelves, nutrients can [[upwell]] from the ocean depth, or [[land runoff]] can be distributed by storms and ocean currents. In these areas, given that both sunlight and nutrients are now present, phytoplankton can rapidly establish itself, multiplying so fast that the water turns green from the chlorophyll, resulting in an [[algal bloom]]. These nutrient rich surface waters are among the most biologically productive in the world, supporting billions of tonnes of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].<ref name=sunlit />\n\n\"Phytoplankton are eaten by [[zooplankton]] - small animals which, like phytoplankton, drift in the ocean currents. The most abundant zooplankton species are [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]: tiny [[crustacean]]s that are the most numerous animals on Earth. Other types of zooplankton include [[jelly fish]] and the [[larvae]] of fish, [[marine worm]]s, [[starfish]], and other marine organisms\".<ref name=sunlit /> In turn, the zooplankton are eaten by [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] animals, including some [[seabird]]s, small [[forage fish]] like herrings and sardines, [[whale shark]]s, [[manta ray]]s, and the largest animal in the world, the [[blue whale]]. Yet again, moving up the [[foodchain]], the small forage fish are in turn eaten by larger predators, such as tuna, marlin, sharks, large squid, seabirds, dolphins, and [[toothed whale]]s.<ref name=sunlit />\n\n===Deep sea===\n[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|left|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]\n{{see also|Deep sea|Deep sea communities}}\n\nThe [[deep sea]] starts at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses most of its energy in the water. Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light a unique evolution known as [[bio-luminescence]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nIn the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic life forms adapted to living in these deeper zones.<ref name=\"Moyle585\">Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 585</ref>\n\nMuch of the [[aphotic zone]]'s energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]]. In deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The \"snowflakes\" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nSome deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n[[File:PSM V23 D086 The deep sea fish eurypharynx pelecanoides.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] eel can swallow a fish much larger than itself]]\n\nThe fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s. \"<ref name=\"Moyle591\">Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 591</ref>\n\n[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Haedrich1996\">Haedrich RL (1996) [https://archive.today/20121017043834/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203565/abstract \"Deep-water fishes: evolution and adaptation in the earth's largest living spaces\"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''49'''(sA):40-53.</ref> The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.<ref name=\"Moyle586\">Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 586</ref>\n\nThe [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] is a deep sea eel with an enormous loosely hinged mouth.

In 1604, he was sent on a mission to France and pleaded for the Huguenots, which annoyed [[Henry IV of France]] and caused a substantial reduction of the present made to the English envoy. On 21 June 1606, he was created by patent a baron for life with precedence next to the barons, but without a place or voice in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], no doubt to render his advancement less unpalatable to the English lords.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=339}}\n\nThe king bestowed on him numerous grants, paid his debts, and secured for him a rich bride in the person of Honoria, only daughter and heir of [[Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich|Edward, Lord Denny]]. Their marriage was celebrated by ''[[Lord Hay's Masque]],'' staged on 6 January 1607. On 9 February 1608 he performed in the masque ''[[The Hue and Cry After Cupid]]'' at [[Whitehall Palace]] as a sign of the zodiac, to celebrate the wedding of [[John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness|John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington]] to Elizabeth Radclyffe.<ref>Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 223.</ref> In 1610 he was made a knight of the [[Order of the Bath]], and in 1613 master of the wardrobe, while in 1615 he was created Lord Hay of [[Sawley, Lancashire|Sawley]], and took his seat in the [[House of Lords]]. At this time, his first wife Honora was buried 16 August 1614 at Waltham Abbey.
