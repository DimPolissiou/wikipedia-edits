Arkwright's mill was sublet in 1792, when Arkwright's son, [[Richard Arkwright Junior|Richard]], began to sell off the family's property assets in his move towards banking. It was named [[Haarlem Mill]] in 1815, when it was converted to weaving tape, by Madely, Hackett and Riley, who had established Haarlem Tape Works in Derby in 1806. In 1879 the Wheatcroft family, who were producing tape at Speedwell Mill, expanded into Haarlem. The two mills together employed 230 people, and it was said that their weekly output equalled the circumference of the earth, and that Wirksworth was the primary producer of [[red tape]] for [[Whitehall]]. These mills are close together at Miller's Green next to the Derby road. Haarlem Mill now houses an art collective, while Speedwell Mill is now private houses and a carpentry workshop.\n\n==Geography==\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] Wirksworth civil parish had 2,416 dwellings, 2,256 households and a population of 5,038.<ref name=2011census/>\n\nDistricts of Wirksworth include Yokecliffe, Gorsey Bank, Bolehill, Mountford and Miller's Green. Bolehill, although technically a hamlet in its own right in Wirksworth's suburbs, is the oldest and most northern part of the town, while Yokecliffe is a newer estate in the western area of the town. Modern houses have recently been built in the Three Trees area and at the bottom of Steeple Grange, as Spring Close.\n\n==Education==\nThere are five schools in Wirksworth:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wirksworth-federation-inf.ik.org/p_Home.ikml |title=Wirksworth Federation Infant Schools |publisher=Wirksworth-federation-inf.ik.org |date=30 April 2012 |access-date=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172813/http://www.wirksworth-federation-inf.ik.org/p_Home.ikml |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Church of England]] and county infants, and regularly combined but on two sites, Wirksworth Junior School, the [[Anthony Gell School]] and Callow Park College.

The current school is an 11\u201318 comprehensive on a larger site by the Hannage Brook with about 800 pupils. The school's four houses are named after Fearne, Arkwright ([[Sir Richard Arkwright]]), Wright ([[Joseph Wright of Derby]]) and Gell.

{"title_page": "Last mile", "text_new": "{{short description|phrase referring to the last leg of network delivery}}\n{{about|telecommunications terminology|the use of the term \"last mile\" in relation to transportation|Last mile (transportation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe '''last mile''' or '''last kilometer''' is a phrase widely used in the [[telecommunication]]s, [[cable television]] and [[internet]] industries to refer to the final leg of the [[telecommunications network]]s that deliver telecommunication services to retail end-users (customers). More specifically, the ''last mile'' describes the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user's premises. Examples are the copper wire [[subscriber line]]s connecting landline [[telephones]] to the local [[telephone exchange]]; [[coaxial cable]] [[service drop]]s carrying [[cable television]] signals from [[utility pole]]s to subscribers' homes, and [[cell tower]]s linking local [[cell phones]] to the [[cellular network]]. The word \"mile\" is used metaphorically; the length of the last mile link may be more or less than a mile. Because the last mile of a network to the user is conversely the first mile from the user's premises to the outside world when the user is sending data, the term '''first mile''' is also alternatively used.\n\nThe last mile is typically the speed bottleneck in communication networks; its [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] effectively limits the bandwidth of data that can be delivered to the customer. This is because retail telecommunication networks have the topology of \"trees\", with relatively few high capacity \"trunk\" communication channels branching out to feed many final mile \"twigs\". The final mile links, being the most numerous and thus the most expensive part of the system, as well as having to interface with a wide variety of user equipment, are the most difficult to upgrade to new technology. For example, telephone [[telecommunications link|trunklines]] that carry phone calls between switching centers are made of modern [[optical fiber]], but the last mile is typically [[twisted pair]] wires, a technology which has essentially remained unchanged for over a century since the original laying of copper phone cables.\n\nTo resolve, or at least mitigate, the problems involved with attempting to provide enhanced services over the last mile, some firms have been mixing networks for decades. One example is [[wireless local loop|fixed wireless access]], where a wireless network is used instead of wires to connect a stationary [[Terminal (telecommunication)|terminal]] to the [[wireline (networking)|wireline]] network. Various solutions are being developed which are seen as an alternative to the last mile of standard [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s. These include [[WiMAX]] and [[broadband over power lines]].\n\nIn recent years, usage of the term \"last mile\" has expanded outside the communications industries, to include other distribution networks that deliver goods to customers, such as the pipes that deliver water and [[natural gas]] to customer premises, and the final legs of [[mail]] and [[package delivery]] services.<ref name=\"Spectrum\">{{cite news |last1=Cherry |first1=Steven |title=The Wireless Last Mile |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/the-wireless-last-mile |accessdate=26 April 2019 |work=IEEE Spectrum |issue=Special Report |publisher=IEEE |date=September 1, 2003}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>The term has also been used to describe education and training providers that more tightly link individuals with job opportunities.<ref>{{cite web | url=  https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/the-last-mile-in-education-and-training/ | title= The 'last mile' in education and training  | publisher=  [[techcrunch.com]] | date=  Jun 25, 2017|ref=harv}}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Balcik |first1=Burcu |last2=Beamon |first2=Benita M. |last3=Smilowitz |first3=Karen |title=Last Mile Distribution in Humanitarian Relief |journal=Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems |date=30 April 2008 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=51\u201363 |doi=10.1080/15472450802023329 |url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/last-mile-distribution-in-humanitarian-relief |accessdate=12 February 2019 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Existing delivery system problems==\n[[File:The last mile hierarchy.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Schematic representation of the [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] topology of retail distribution networks. The \"last mile\" links are represented by the fine lines at the bottom. ]]\n\nThe increasing worldwide demand for rapid, low-[[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and high-volume communication of [[information]] to homes and businesses has made economical information distribution and delivery increasingly important. As demand has escalated, particularly fueled by the widespread adoption of the [[Internet]], the need for economical high-speed access by end-users located at millions of locations has ballooned as well.\n\nAs requirements have changed, the existing systems and networks that were initially pressed into service for this purpose have proven to be inadequate. To date, although a number of approaches have been tried, no single clear solution to the 'last mile problem' has emerged.\n\nAs expressed by [[Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem|Shannon's equation]] for [[channel capacity|channel information capacity]], the omnipresence of [[noise]] in information systems sets a minimum [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (shortened as S/N) requirement in a channel, even when adequate [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|spectral bandwidth]] is available. Since the integral of the rate of information transfer with respect to time is information quantity, this requirement leads to a corresponding minimum [[Eb/N0|energy per bit]]. The problem of sending any given amount of information across a channel can therefore be viewed in terms of sending sufficient Information-Carrying Energy (ICE).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} For this reason the concept of an ICE 'pipe' or 'conduit' is relevant and useful for examining existing systems.\n\nThe distribution of information to a great number of widely separated end-users can be compared to the distribution of many other resources. Some familiar analogies are:\n*Blood distribution to a large number of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s over a system of [[veins]], [[arteries]] and [[capillaries]]\n*Water distribution by a [[drip irrigation]] system to individual [[plants]], including [[river]]s, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[water mains]], etc.\n*Nourishment to a plant's leaves through [[root]]s, [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] and [[branches]].\n\nAll of these have in common conduits that carry a relatively small amount of a resource a short distance to a very large number of physically separated endpoints. Also common are conduits supporting more voluminous flow, which combine and carry many individual portions over much greater distances. The shorter, lower-volume conduits, which individually serve only one or a small fraction of the endpoints, may have far greater combined length than the larger capacity ones. These common attributes are shown to the right.\n\n===Costs and efficiency===\nThe high-capacity conduits in these systems tend to also have in common the ability to efficiently transfer the resource over a long distance. Only a small fraction of the resource being transferred is wasted, lost, or misdirected. The same cannot necessarily be said of lower-capacity conduits.\n\nOne reason has to do with the [[Economies of scale|efficiency of scale]]. Conduits that are located closer to the endpoint, or end-user, do not individually have as many users supporting them. Even though they are smaller, each has the overhead of an \"installation\" obtaining and maintaining a suitable path over which the resource can flow. The funding and resources supporting these smaller conduits tend to come from the immediate locale.\n\nThis can have the advantage of a \"small-government model\". That is, the management and resources for these conduits is provided by local entities and therefore can be optimized to achieve the best solutions in the immediate environment and also to make best use of local resources. However, the lower operating efficiencies and relatively greater installation expenses, compared with the transfer capacities, can cause these smaller conduits, as a whole, to be the most expensive and difficult part of the complete distribution system.\n\nThese characteristics have been displayed in the birth, growth, and funding of the Internet. The earliest inter-computer communication tended to be accomplished with direct wireline connections between individual computers. These grew into clusters of small [[local area network]]s (LAN). The [[TCP/IP]] suite of [[Internet protocol suite|protocols]] was born out of the need to connect several of these LANs together, particularly as related to common projects among the [[United States Department of Defense]], industry and some academic institutions.\n\n[[ARPANET]] came into being to further these interests. In addition to providing a way for multiple computers and users to share a common inter-LAN connection, the TCP/IP protocols provided a standardized way for dissimilar computers and operating systems to exchange information over this inter-network. The funding and support for the connections among LANs could be spread over one or even several LANs.\n\nAs each new LAN, or subnet, was added, the new subnet's constituents enjoyed access to the greater network. At the same time the new subnet enabled access to any network or networks with which it was already networked. Thus the growth became a mutually inclusive or \"win-win\" event.\n\n====Economies of scale====\nIn general, economy of scale makes an increase in capacity of a conduit less expensive as the capacity is increased. There is an overhead associated with the creation of any conduit. This overhead is not repeated as capacity is increased within the potential of the technology being utilized.\n\nAs the Internet has grown in size, by some estimates doubling in the number of users every eighteen months, economy of scale has resulted in increasingly large information conduits providing the longest distance and highest capacity backbone connections. In recent years, the capacity of [[fiber-optic communication]], aided by a supporting industry, has resulted in an expansion of raw capacity, so much so that in the United States a large amount of installed fiber infrastructure is not being used because it is currently excess capacity \"[[dark fiber]]\".\n\nThis excess backbone capacity exists in spite of the trend of increasing per-user data rates and overall quantity of data. Initially, only the inter-LAN connections were high speed. End-users used existing telephone lines and modems, which were capable of data rates of only a few hundred [[Bit rate|bit/s]]. Now almost all end users enjoy access at 100 or more times those early rates.\n\n==Economical information transfer==\nBefore considering the characteristics of existing last-mile information delivery mechanisms, it is important to further examine what makes information conduits effective. As the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]] shows, it is the combination of bandwidth and [[signal-to-noise ratio]] which determines the maximum information rate of a channel. The product of the average information rate and time yields total information transfer. In the presence of [[Signal noise|noise]], this corresponds to some amount of transferred information-carrying energy (ICE). Therefore, the economics of information transfer may be viewed in terms of the economics of the transfer of ICE.\n\nEffective last-mile conduits must:\n#Deliver signal power, S&nbsp;\u2014 (must have adequate signal power capacity).\n#Experience low loss (low occurrence of conversion to unusable energy forms).\n#Support wide transmission [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].\n#Deliver high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR)&nbsp;\u2014 low unwanted-signal ([[Noise]]) power, N.\n#Provide [[roaming|nomadic]] connectivity.\n\nIn addition to these factors, a good solution to the last-mile problem must provide each user:\n#High [[availability]] and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].\n#Low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]; latency must be small compared with required interaction times.\n#High per-user capacity.\n##A conduit which is shared among multiple end-users must provide a correspondingly higher capacity in order to properly support each individual user. This must be true for information transfer in each direction.\n##Affordability; suitable capacity must be financially viable.\n\n==Existing last mile delivery systems==\n\n===Wired systems (including optical fiber)===\nWired systems provide guided conduits for Information-Carrying Energy (ICE). They all have some degree of shielding, which limits their susceptibility to external noise sources. These transmission lines have losses which are proportional to length. Without the addition of periodic amplification, there is some maximum length beyond which all of these systems fail to deliver an adequate S/N ratio to support information flow.  Dielectric [[Fiber to the x|optical fiber]] systems support heavier flow at higher cost.\n\n====Local area networks (LAN)====\nTraditional wired [[local area network]]ing systems require copper coaxial cable or a twisted pair to be run between or among two or more of the nodes in the network. Common systems operate at 100 Mbit/s, and newer ones also support 1000 Mbit/s or more. While length may be limited by [[collision detection]] and avoidance requirements, signal loss and reflections over these lines also define a maximum distance. The decrease in information capacity made available to an individual user is roughly proportional to the number of users sharing a LAN.\n\n====Telephone====\nIn the late 20th century, improvements in the use of existing copper telephone lines increased their capabilities if maximum line length is controlled. With support for higher transmission bandwidth and improved modulation, these [[digital subscriber line]] schemes have increased capability 20-50 times as compared to the previous [[voiceband]] systems. These methods are not based on altering the fundamental physical properties and limitations of the medium, which, apart from the introduction of [[twisted pair]]s, are no different today than when the first telephone exchange was opened in 1877 by the Bell Telephone Company.<ref name=\"nxtbook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/natoa/journal_2009spring/index.php#/14|title=NATOA Journal - Spring 2009|publisher=|ref=harv}}}</ref>\n\nThe history and long life of copper-based communications infrastructure is both a testament to the ability to derive new value from simple concepts through technological innovation&nbsp;\u2013 and a warning that copper communications infrastructure is beginning to offer [[diminishing returns]] for continued investment.<ref name=\"nxtbook\" /> However one of the largest costs associated with maintaining an ageing copper infrastructure is that of truck roll<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://multi-link.net/how-much-does-a-service-truck-roll-cost-your-company/|title=How much does a service \"truck roll\" cost your company? \u2022 Multi-Link Inc.|date=2015-04-16|work=Multi-Link Inc|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US|ref=harv}}}</ref> - sending engineers to physically test, repair, replace and provide new copper connections, and this cost is particularly prevalent in providing rural broadband service over copper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2016/05/aaisp-struggles-cost-keeping-uk-rural-broadband-alive.html|title=UK ISPs Struggle with the Cost of Keeping 20CN Rural Broadband Alive - ISPreview UK|last=Jackson|first=Mark|website=www.ispreview.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-23|ref=harv}}}</ref> New technologies such as G.Fast and VDSL2 offer viable high speed solutions to rural broadband provision over existing copper.

However, they are by nature shared systems and the spectrum available for reverse information flow and achievable [[signal-to-noise ratio|S/N]] are limited. As was done for initial unidirectional TV communication, cable loss is mitigated through the use of periodic amplifiers within the system. These factors set an upper limit on per-user information capacity, particularly when many users share a common section of cable or [[access network]].\n\n====Optical fiber====\n{{Further|Optical fiber}}\nFiber offers high information capacity and after the turn of the 21st century became the deployed medium of choice (\"[[Fiber to the x|Fiber to the ''x'']]\") given its scalability in the face of the increasing bandwidth requirements of modern applications.\n\nIn 2004, according to Richard Lynch, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of the telecom giant [[Verizon]], the company saw the world moving toward vastly higher bandwidth applications as consumers loved everything broadband had to offer and eagerly devoured as much as they could get, including two-way, user-generated content. Copper and coaxial networks would not&nbsp;\u2013 in fact, could not&nbsp;\u2013 satisfy these demands, which precipitated Verizon's aggressive move into [[Fiber to the x|fiber-to-the-home]] via [[FiOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www22.verizon.com/Content/ExecutiveCenter/Richard_Lynch/ftth_conference_expo/ftth_conference_expo.htm|title=Verizon Leadership Executive Biographies - Verizon|publisher=|ref=harv}}}</ref>\n\nFiber is a [[future-proof]] technology that meets the needs of today's users, but unlike other copper-based and wireless last-mile mediums, also has the capacity for years to come, by upgrading the end-point optics and electronics without changing the fiber infrastructure. The fiber itself is installed on existing pole or conduit infrastructure and most of the cost is in labor, providing good regional [[economic stimulus]] in the deployment phase and providing a critical foundation for future regional commerce.\n\n[[fixed line|Fixed copper lines]] have been subject to theft due to the value of copper, but optical fibers make unattractive targets. Optical fibers cannot be converted into anything else, whereas [[Copper#Recycling|copper can be recycled without loss]].\n\n===Wireless delivery systems===\n[[Mobile CDN]] coined the term the ''''mobile mile'''' to categorize the last mile connection when a wireless system is used to reach the customer. In contrast to wired delivery systems, wireless systems use unguided waves to transmit ICE. They all tend to be unshielded and have a greater degree of susceptibility to unwanted signal and noise sources.\n\nBecause these waves are not guided but diverge, in free space these systems are [[attenuation|attenuated]] following an [[inverse-square law]], inversely proportional to distance squared. Losses thus increase more slowly with increasing length than for wired systems, whose loss increases [[exponential decay|exponentially]]. In a free space environment, beyond a given length, the losses in a wireless system are lower than those in a wired system.\n\nIn practice, the presence of atmosphere, and especially obstructions caused by terrain, buildings and foliage can greatly increase the loss above the free space value. Reflection, refraction and diffraction of waves can also alter their transmission characteristics and require specialized systems to accommodate the accompanying distortions.\n\nWireless systems have an advantage over wired systems in last mile applications in not requiring lines to be installed. However, they also have a disadvantage in that their unguided nature makes them more susceptible to unwanted noise and signals. Spectral reuse can therefore be limited.\n\n====Lightwaves and free-space optics====\nVisible and infrared light waves are much shorter than radio frequency waves. Their use to transmit data is referred to as [[free-space optical communication]]. Being short, light waves can be focused or collimated with a small lens/antenna, and to a much higher degree than radio waves. Thus, a receiving device can recover a greater portion of the transmitted signal.\n\nAlso, because of the high frequency, a high [[Bit rate|data transfer rate]] may be available. However, in practical last mile environments, obstructions and de-steering of these beams, and absorption by elements of the atmosphere including fog and rain, particularly over longer paths, can greatly restrict their use for last-mile wireless communications. Longer (redder) waves suffer less obstruction but may carry lower data rates. See [[RONJA]].\n\n====Radio waves====\nRadio frequencies (RF), from low frequencies through the microwave region, have wavelengths much longer than visible light. Although this means that it is not possible to focus the beams nearly as tightly as for light, it also means that the aperture or \"capture area\" of even the simplest, omnidirectional antenna is significantly larger than that of a lens in any feasible optical system. This characteristic results in greatly increased [[attenuation]] or \"path loss\" for systems that are not highly directional.\n\nActually, the term [[path loss]] is something of a misnomer because no energy is lost on a free-space path. Rather, it is merely not received by the receiving antenna. The apparent reduction in transmission, as frequency is increased, is an artifact of the change in the aperture of a given type of antenna.\n\nRelative to the last-mile problem, these longer wavelengths have an advantage over light waves when omnidirectional or sectored transmissions are considered. The larger aperture of radio antennas results in much greater signal levels for a given path length and therefore higher information capacity. On the other hand, the lower carrier frequencies are not able to support the high information bandwidths, which are required by Shannon's equation when the practical limits of S/N have been reached.\n\nFor the above reasons, wireless radio systems are optimal for lower-information-capacity broadcast communications delivered over longer paths. For high-information capacity, highly-directive [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] over short ranges, wireless light-wave systems are the most useful.\n\n====One-way (broadcast) radio and television communications====\nHistorically, most high-information-capacity broadcast has used lower frequencies, generally no higher than the UHF television region, with television itself being a prime example. Terrestrial television has generally been limited to the region above 50&nbsp;MHz where sufficient information bandwidth is available, and below 1,000&nbsp;MHz, due to problems associated with increased path loss, as mentioned above.\n\n====Two-way wireless communications====\nTwo-way communication systems have primarily been limited to lower-information-capacity applications, such as audio, facsimile, or [[radioteletype]]. For the most part, higher-capacity systems, such as two-way video communications or terrestrial microwave telephone and data trunks, have been limited and confined to UHF or microwave and to point-point paths.\n\nHigher capacity systems such as third-generation cellular telephone systems require a large infrastructure of more closely spaced cell sites in order to maintain communications within typical environments, where path losses are much greater than in free space and which also require omnidirectional access by the users.\n\n====Satellite communications====\nFor information delivery to end users, satellite systems, by nature, have relatively long path lengths, even for low earth-orbiting satellites. They are also very expensive to deploy and therefore each satellite must serve many users. Additionally, the very long paths of geostationary satellites cause information latency that makes many real-time applications unfeasible.\n\nAs a solution to the last-mile problem, satellite systems have application and sharing limitations. The ICE which they transmit must be spread over a relatively large geographical area. This causes the received signal to be relatively small, unless very large or directional terrestrial antennas are used. A parallel problem exists when a satellite is receiving.\n\nIn that case, the satellite system must have a very great information capacity in order to accommodate a multitude of sharing users and each user must have large antenna, with attendant directivity and pointing requirements, in order to obtain even modest information-rate transfer. These requirements render high-information-capacity, bi-directional information systems uneconomical. This is one reason why the [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium]] satellite system was not more successful.\n\n====Broadcast versus point-to-point====\nFor terrestrial and satellite systems, economical, high-capacity, last-mile communications requires [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] transmission systems. Except for extremely small geographic areas, broadcast systems are only able to deliver high S/N ratios at low frequencies where there is not sufficient spectrum to support the large information capacity needed by a large number of users. Although complete \"flooding\" of a region can be accomplished, such systems have the fundamental characteristic that most of the radiated ICE never reaches a user and is wasted.\n\nAs information requirements increase, broadcast [[wireless mesh]] systems (also sometimes referred to as [[microcell]]s or nano-cells) which are small enough to provide adequate information distribution to and from a relatively small number of local users require a prohibitively large number of broadcast locations or points of presence along with a large amount of excess capacity to make up for the wasted energy.\n\n===Intermediate system===\nRecently a new type of information transport  midway between wired and wireless systems has been discovered. Called [[Single-wire transmission line#E-Line|E-Line]], it uses a single central conductor but no outer conductor or shield. The energy is transported in a plane wave which, unlike radio does not diverge, whereas like radio it has no outer guiding structure.\n\nThis system exhibits a combination of the attributes of wired and wireless systems and can support high information capacity [[broadband over power lines|utilizing existing power lines]] over a broad range of frequencies from [[Radio frequency|RF]] through [[microwave]].\n\n===Line aggregation===\n[[Link aggregation|Aggregation]] is a method of bonding multiple lines to achieve a faster, more reliable connection. Some companies{{weasel inline|date=December 2015}} believe that ADSL aggregation (or \"bonding\") is the solution to the UK's last mile problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS92087+05-Jan-2009+BW20090105?symbol=INAP.O|title=Internap Chosen by Sharedband to Help Bring High-Speed Internet to New Business and Residential Customers|publisher=Reuters|date=January 5, 2009|ref=harv}}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Backhaul (telecommunications)]]\n*[[Ethernet in the first mile]]\n*[[Local loop]]\n*[[Middle mile]]\n*[[Point-to-multipoint communication|Point-to-multipoint]]\n*[[Last mile (transportation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Last Mile}}\n[[Category:Fiber to the premises]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:Local loop]]\n[[Category:Network access]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|phrase referring to the last leg of network delivery}}\n{{about|telecommunications terminology|the use of the term \"last mile\" in relation to transportation|Last mile (transportation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThe '''last mile''' or '''last kilometer''' is a phrase widely used in the [[telecommunication]]s, [[cable television]] and [[internet]] industries to refer to the final leg of the [[telecommunications network]]s that deliver telecommunication services to retail end-users (customers). More specifically, the ''last mile'' describes the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user's premises. Examples are the copper wire [[subscriber line]]s connecting landline [[telephones]] to the local [[telephone exchange]]; [[coaxial cable]] [[service drop]]s carrying [[cable television]] signals from [[utility pole]]s to subscribers' homes, and [[cell tower]]s linking local [[cell phones]] to the [[cellular network]]. The word \"mile\" is used metaphorically; the length of the last mile link may be more or less than a mile. Because the last mile of a network to the user is conversely the first mile from the user's premises to the outside world when the user is sending data, the term '''first mile''' is also alternatively used.\n\nThe last mile is typically the speed bottleneck in communication networks; its [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] effectively limits the bandwidth of data that can be delivered to the customer. This is because retail telecommunication networks have the topology of \"trees\", with relatively few high capacity \"trunk\" communication channels branching out to feed many final mile \"twigs\". The final mile links, being the most numerous and thus the most expensive part of the system, as well as having to interface with a wide variety of user equipment, are the most difficult to upgrade to new technology. For example, telephone [[telecommunications link|trunklines]] that carry phone calls between switching centers are made of modern [[optical fiber]], but the last mile is typically [[twisted pair]] wires, a technology which has essentially remained unchanged for over a century since the original laying of copper phone cables.\n\nTo resolve, or at least mitigate, the problems involved with attempting to provide enhanced services over the last mile, some firms have been mixing networks for decades. One example is [[wireless local loop|fixed wireless access]], where a wireless network is used instead of wires to connect a stationary [[Terminal (telecommunication)|terminal]] to the [[wireline (networking)|wireline]] network. Various solutions are being developed which are seen as an alternative to the last mile of standard [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s. These include [[WiMAX]] and [[broadband over power lines]].\n\nIn recent years, usage of the term \"last mile\" has expanded outside the communications industries, to include other distribution networks that deliver goods to customers, such as the pipes that deliver water and [[natural gas]] to customer premises, and the final legs of [[mail]] and [[package delivery]] services.<ref name=\"Spectrum\">{{cite news |last1=Cherry |first1=Steven |title=The Wireless Last Mile |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/the-wireless-last-mile |accessdate=26 April 2019 |work=IEEE Spectrum |issue=Special Report |publisher=IEEE |date=September 1, 2003}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>The term has also been used to describe education and training providers that more tightly link individuals with job opportunities.<ref>{{cite web | url=  https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/the-last-mile-in-education-and-training/ | title= The 'last mile' in education and training  | publisher=  [[techcrunch.com]] | date=  Jun 25, 2017|ref=harv}}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Balcik |first1=Burcu |last2=Beamon |first2=Benita M. |last3=Smilowitz |first3=Karen |title=Last Mile Distribution in Humanitarian Relief |journal=Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems |date=30 April 2008 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=51\u201363 |doi=10.1080/15472450802023329 |url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/last-mile-distribution-in-humanitarian-relief |accessdate=12 February 2019 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Existing delivery system problems==\n[[File:The last mile hierarchy.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Schematic representation of the [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] topology of retail distribution networks. The \"last mile\" links are represented by the fine lines at the bottom. ]]\n\nThe increasing worldwide demand for rapid, low-[[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and high-volume communication of [[information]] to homes and businesses has made economical information distribution and delivery increasingly important. As demand has escalated, particularly fueled by the widespread adoption of the [[Internet]], the need for economical high-speed access by end-users located at millions of locations has ballooned as well.\n\nAs requirements have changed, the existing systems and networks that were initially pressed into service for this purpose have proven to be inadequate. To date, although a number of approaches have been tried, no single clear solution to the 'last mile problem' has emerged.\n\nAs expressed by [[Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem|Shannon's equation]] for [[channel capacity|channel information capacity]], the omnipresence of [[noise]] in information systems sets a minimum [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (shortened as S/N) requirement in a channel, even when adequate [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|spectral bandwidth]] is available. Since the integral of the rate of information transfer with respect to time is information quantity, this requirement leads to a corresponding minimum [[Eb/N0|energy per bit]]. The problem of sending any given amount of information across a channel can therefore be viewed in terms of sending sufficient Information-Carrying Energy (ICE).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} For this reason the concept of an ICE 'pipe' or 'conduit' is relevant and useful for examining existing systems.\n\nThe distribution of information to a great number of widely separated end-users can be compared to the distribution of many other resources. Some familiar analogies are:\n*Blood distribution to a large number of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s over a system of [[veins]], [[arteries]] and [[capillaries]]\n*Water distribution by a [[drip irrigation]] system to individual [[plants]], including [[river]]s, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[water mains]], etc.\n*Nourishment to a plant's leaves through [[root]]s, [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] and [[branches]].\n\nAll of these have in common conduits that carry a relatively small amount of a resource a short distance to a very large number of physically separated endpoints. Also common are conduits supporting more voluminous flow, which combine and carry many individual portions over much greater distances. The shorter, lower-volume conduits, which individually serve only one or a small fraction of the endpoints, may have far greater combined length than the larger capacity ones. These common attributes are shown to the right.\n\n===Costs and efficiency===\nThe high-capacity conduits in these systems tend to also have in common the ability to efficiently transfer the resource over a long distance. Only a small fraction of the resource being transferred is wasted, lost, or misdirected. The same cannot necessarily be said of lower-capacity conduits.\n\nOne reason has to do with the [[Economies of scale|efficiency of scale]]. Conduits that are located closer to the endpoint, or end-user, do not individually have as many users supporting them. Even though they are smaller, each has the overhead of an \"installation\" obtaining and maintaining a suitable path over which the resource can flow. The funding and resources supporting these smaller conduits tend to come from the immediate locale.\n\nThis can have the advantage of a \"small-government model\". That is, the management and resources for these conduits is provided by local entities and therefore can be optimized to achieve the best solutions in the immediate environment and also to make best use of local resources. However, the lower operating efficiencies and relatively greater installation expenses, compared with the transfer capacities, can cause these smaller conduits, as a whole, to be the most expensive and difficult part of the complete distribution system.\n\nThese characteristics have been displayed in the birth, growth, and funding of the Internet. The earliest inter-computer communication tended to be accomplished with direct wireline connections between individual computers. These grew into clusters of small [[local area network]]s (LAN). The [[TCP/IP]] suite of [[Internet protocol suite|protocols]] was born out of the need to connect several of these LANs together, particularly as related to common projects among the [[United States Department of Defense]], industry and some academic institutions.\n\n[[ARPANET]] came into being to further these interests. In addition to providing a way for multiple computers and users to share a common inter-LAN connection, the TCP/IP protocols provided a standardized way for dissimilar computers and operating systems to exchange information over this inter-network. The funding and support for the connections among LANs could be spread over one or even several LANs.\n\nAs each new LAN, or subnet, was added, the new subnet's constituents enjoyed access to the greater network. At the same time the new subnet enabled access to any network or networks with which it was already networked. Thus the growth became a mutually inclusive or \"win-win\" event.\n\n====Economies of scale====\nIn general, economy of scale makes an increase in capacity of a conduit less expensive as the capacity is increased. There is an overhead associated with the creation of any conduit. This overhead is not repeated as capacity is increased within the potential of the technology being utilized.\n\nAs the Internet has grown in size, by some estimates doubling in the number of users every eighteen months, economy of scale has resulted in increasingly large information conduits providing the longest distance and highest capacity backbone connections. In recent years, the capacity of [[fiber-optic communication]], aided by a supporting industry, has resulted in an expansion of raw capacity, so much so that in the United States a large amount of installed fiber infrastructure is not being used because it is currently excess capacity \"[[dark fiber]]\".\n\nThis excess backbone capacity exists in spite of the trend of increasing per-user data rates and overall quantity of data. Initially, only the inter-LAN connections were high speed. End-users used existing telephone lines and modems, which were capable of data rates of only a few hundred [[Bit rate|bit/s]]. Now almost all end users enjoy access at 100 or more times those early rates.\n\n==Economical information transfer==\nBefore considering the characteristics of existing last-mile information delivery mechanisms, it is important to further examine what makes information conduits effective. As the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]] shows, it is the combination of bandwidth and [[signal-to-noise ratio]] which determines the maximum information rate of a channel. The product of the average information rate and time yields total information transfer. In the presence of [[Signal noise|noise]], this corresponds to some amount of transferred information-carrying energy (ICE). Therefore, the economics of information transfer may be viewed in terms of the economics of the transfer of ICE.\n\nEffective last-mile conduits must:\n#Deliver signal power, S&nbsp;\u2014 (must have adequate signal power capacity).\n#Experience low loss (low occurrence of conversion to unusable energy forms).\n#Support wide transmission [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].\n#Deliver high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR)&nbsp;\u2014 low unwanted-signal ([[Noise]]) power, N.\n#Provide [[roaming|nomadic]] connectivity.\n\nIn addition to these factors, a good solution to the last-mile problem must provide each user:\n#High [[availability]] and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].\n#Low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]; latency must be small compared with required interaction times.\n#High per-user capacity.\n##A conduit which is shared among multiple end-users must provide a correspondingly higher capacity in order to properly support each individual user. This must be true for information transfer in each direction.\n##Affordability; suitable capacity must be financially viable.\n\n==Existing last mile delivery systems==\n\n===Wired systems (including optical fiber)===\nWired systems provide guided conduits for Information-Carrying Energy (ICE). They all have some degree of shielding, which limits their susceptibility to external noise sources. These transmission lines have losses which are proportional to length. Without the addition of periodic amplification, there is some maximum length beyond which all of these systems fail to deliver an adequate S/N ratio to support information flow.  Dielectric [[Fiber to the x|optical fiber]] systems support heavier flow at higher cost.\n\n====Local area networks (LAN)====\nTraditional wired [[local area network]]ing systems require copper coaxial cable or a twisted pair to be run between or among two or more of the nodes in the network. Common systems operate at 100 Mbit/s, and newer ones also support 1000 Mbit/s or more. While length may be limited by [[collision detection]] and avoidance requirements, signal loss and reflections over these lines also define a maximum distance. The decrease in information capacity made available to an individual user is roughly proportional to the number of users sharing a LAN.\n\n====Telephone====\nIn the late 20th century, improvements in the use of existing copper telephone lines increased their capabilities if maximum line length is controlled. With support for higher transmission bandwidth and improved modulation, these [[digital subscriber line]] schemes have increased capability 20-50 times as compared to the previous [[voiceband]] systems. These methods are not based on altering the fundamental physical properties and limitations of the medium, which, apart from the introduction of [[twisted pair]]s, are no different today than when the first telephone exchange was opened in 1877 by the Bell Telephone Company.<ref name=\"nxtbook\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/natoa/journal_2009spring/index.php#/14|title=NATOA Journal - Spring 2009|publisher=|ref=harv}}}</ref>\n\nThe history and long life of copper-based communications infrastructure is both a testament to the ability to derive new value from simple concepts through technological innovation&nbsp;\u2013 and a warning that copper communications infrastructure is beginning to offer [[diminishing returns]] for continued investment.<ref name=\"nxtbook\" /> However one of the largest costs associated with maintaining an ageing copper infrastructure is that of truck roll<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://multi-link.net/how-much-does-a-service-truck-roll-cost-your-company/|title=How much does a service \"truck roll\" cost your company? \u2022 Multi-Link Inc.|date=2015-04-16|work=Multi-Link Inc|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en-US|ref=harv}}}</ref> - sending engineers to physically test, repair, replace and provide new copper connections, and this cost is particularly prevalent in providing rural broadband service over copper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2016/05/aaisp-struggles-cost-keeping-uk-rural-broadband-alive.html|title=UK ISPs Struggle with the Cost of Keeping 20CN Rural Broadband Alive - ISPreview UK|last=Jackson|first=Mark|website=www.ispreview.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-23|ref=harv}}}</ref> New technologies such as G.Fast and VDSL2 offer viable high speed solutions to rural broadband provision over existing copper.

However, they are by nature shared systems and the spectrum available for reverse information flow and achievable [[signal-to-noise ratio|S/N]] are limited. As was done for initial unidirectional TV communication, cable loss is mitigated through the use of periodic amplifiers within the system. These factors set an upper limit on per-user information capacity, particularly when many users share a common section of cable or [[access network]].\n\n====Optical fiber====\n{{Further|Optical fiber}}\nFiber offers high information capacity and after the turn of the 21st century became the deployed medium of choice (\"[[Fiber to the x|Fiber to the ''x'']]\") given its scalability in the face of the increasing bandwidth requirements of modern applications.\n\nIn 2004, according to Richard Lynch, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of the telecom giant [[Verizon]], the company saw the world moving toward vastly higher bandwidth applications as consumers loved everything broadband had to offer and eagerly devoured as much as they could get, including two-way, user-generated content. Copper and coaxial networks would not&nbsp;\u2013 in fact, could not&nbsp;\u2013 satisfy these demands, which precipitated Verizon's aggressive move into [[Fiber to the x|fiber-to-the-home]] via [[FiOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www22.verizon.com/Content/ExecutiveCenter/Richard_Lynch/ftth_conference_expo/ftth_conference_expo.htm|title=Verizon Leadership Executive Biographies - Verizon|publisher=|ref=harv}}}</ref>\n\nFiber is a [[future-proof]] technology that meets the needs of today's users, but unlike other copper-based and wireless last-mile mediums, also has the capacity for years to come, by upgrading the end-point optics and electronics without changing the fiber infrastructure. The fiber itself is installed on existing pole or conduit infrastructure and most of the cost is in labor, providing good regional [[economic stimulus]] in the deployment phase and providing a critical foundation for future regional commerce.\n\n[[fixed line|Fixed copper lines]] have been subject to theft due to the value of copper, but optical fibers make unattractive targets. Optical fibers cannot be converted into anything else, whereas [[Copper#Recycling|copper can be recycled without loss]].\n\n===Wireless delivery systems===\n[[Mobile CDN]] coined the term the ''''mobile mile'''' to categorize the last mile connection when a wireless systems is used to reach the customer. In contrast to wired delivery systems, wireless systems use unguided waves to transmit ICE. They all tend to be unshielded and have a greater degree of susceptibility to unwanted signal and noise sources.\n\nBecause these waves are not guided but diverge, in free space these systems are [[attenuation|attenuated]] following an [[inverse-square law]], inversely proportional to distance squared. Losses thus increase more slowly with increasing length than for wired systems, whose loss increases [[exponential decay|exponentially]]. In a free space environment, beyond a given length, the losses in a wireless system are lower than those in a wired system.\n\nIn practice, the presence of atmosphere, and especially obstructions caused by terrain, buildings and foliage can greatly increase the loss above the free space value. Reflection, refraction and diffraction of waves can also alter their transmission characteristics and require specialized systems to accommodate the accompanying distortions.\n\nWireless systems have an advantage over wired systems in last mile applications in not requiring lines to be installed. However, they also have a disadvantage in that their unguided nature makes them more susceptible to unwanted noise and signals. Spectral reuse can therefore be limited.\n\n====Lightwaves and free-space optics====\nVisible and infrared light waves are much shorter than radio frequency waves.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me.

Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided that \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself.

Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/>\n\nJackson stated that \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

Jam recalled, \"He said, 'Now that you've seen the film, if you'd like to do a song for it, that'd be great.'\" Segal told Jackson that she was an exceptional actress after becoming convinced she truly loved Murphy's character, leading Jackson to suggest writing an up-tempo love song rather than a ballad.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nThe song was based on a poem Jackson had written, discarded, then rediscovered.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/03/janet-jackson-10-of-the-best|title=Janet Jackson: 10 of the best|last=Cragg|first=Michael|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 3, 2015|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Jackson's original lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam stated that \"the lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up.\" Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. \"We ended up with two different choruses,\" said Jam. \"I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'\" \"The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' and said we should put it at the end of the song.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> Jackson presented three songs including \"Doesn't Really Matter\" and an early version of \"Feels So Right\", later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was a better fit and a \"summertime record.\" A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by [[Rockwilder]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\nIn \"Doesn't Really Matter\", Jackson speaks of looking past physical appearance, choosing to love the person inside. Using a vocal [[falsetto]], Jackson assures \"[It] doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm in love with the inner being,\" considered a \"sweet song of unconditional love.\" Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said \"It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like \u2013 all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, is the most important thing as well as being happy with who you are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.femail.com.au/jacksonii.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 Nutty Professor II Interview |work=Femail.com.au |accessdate=February 2, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe song is based on Jackson's character Denise's \"unconditional love\" for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, \"I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that \u2013 how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him[...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Klump, If You're Nasty |work=[[Yahoo!

{"title_page": "Beta (plasma physics)", "text_new": "The '''beta''' of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], symbolized by ''\u03b2'', is the ratio of the plasma [[pressure]] (''p'' = [[Number density|''n'']] [[Boltzmann's constant|''k''<sub>B</sub>]] [[Temperature|''T'']]) to the [[magnetic pressure]] (''p''<sub>mag</sub> = [[Magnetic field|''B'']]\u00b2/2[[Permeability (electromagnetism)|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]]). The term is commonly used in studies of the Sun and Earth's [[magnetic field]], and in the field of [[fusion power]] designs.\n\nIn the fusion power field, plasma is often confined using strong magnets. Since the temperature of the fuel scales with pressure, reactors attempt to reach the highest pressures possible. The costs of large magnets roughly scales like ''\u03b2<sup>\u00bd</sup>''.  Therefore, beta can be thought of as a ratio of money out to money in for a reactor, and beta can be thought of (very approximately) as an economic indicator of reactor efficiency. For [[tokamak]]s, betas of larger than 0.05 or 5% are desired for economically viable electrical production.\n\nThe same term is also used when discussing the interactions of the [[solar wind]] with various magnetic fields. For example, beta in the corona of the Sun is about 0.01.\n\n==Background==\n===Fusion basics===\n[[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when the [[Nucleus (atomic structure)|nuclei]] of two atoms approach closely enough for the [[nuclear force]] to pull them together into a single larger nucleus. The strong force is opposed by the [[electrostatic force]] created by the positive charge of the nuclei's [[proton]]s, pushing the nuclei apart. The amount of energy that is needed to overcome this repulsion is known as the [[Coulomb barrier]]. The amount of energy released by the fusion reaction when it occurs may be greater or less than the Coulomb barrier. Generally, lighter nuclei with a smaller number of protons and greater number of [[neutron]]s will have the greatest ratio of energy released to energy required, and the majority of [[fusion power]] research focusses on the use of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], two [[isotope]]s of [[hydrogen]].\n\nEven using these isotopes, the Coulomb barrier is large enough that the nuclei must be given great amounts of energy before they will fuse. Although there are a number of ways to do this, the simplest is to heat the gas mixture, which, according to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]], will result in a small number of particles with the required energy even when the gas as a whole is relatively \"cool\" compared to the Coulomb barrier energy. In the case of the D-T mixture, rapid fusion will occur when the gas is heated to about 100 million degrees.<ref name=b18>Bromberg, pg. 18</ref>\n\n===Confinement===\nThis temperature is well beyond the physical limits of any material container that might contain the gasses, which has led to a number of different approaches to solving this problem. The main approach relies on the nature of the fuel at high temperatures. When the fusion fuel gasses are heated to the temperatures required for rapid fusion, they will be completely [[Ionization|ionized]] into a plasma, a mixture of [[electron]]s and nuclei forming a globally neutral gas. As the particles within the gas are charged, this allows them to be manipulated by electric or magnetic fields. This gives rise to the majority of controlled fusion concepts.\n\nEven if this temperature is reached, the gas will be constantly losing energy to its surroundings (cooling off). This gives rise to the concept of the \"confinement time\", the amount of time the plasma is maintained at the required temperature. However, the fusion reactions might deposit their energy back into the plasma, heating it back up, which is a function of the density of the plasma. These considerations are combined in the [[Lawson criterion]], or its modern form, the fusion triple product.  In order to be efficient, the rate of fusion energy being deposited into the reactor would ideally be greater than the rate of loss to the surroundings, a condition known as \"ignition\".\n\n===Magnetic confinement fusion approach===\nIn [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MCF) reactor designs, the plasma is confined within a vacuum chamber using a series of magnetic fields. These fields are normally created using a combination of [[electromagnet]]s and [[electrical current]]s running through the plasma itself. Systems using only magnets are generally built using the [[stellarator]] approach, while those using current only are the [[Pinch (plasma physics)|pinch]] machines. The most studied approach since the 1970s is the [[tokamak]], where the fields generated by the external magnets and internal current are roughly equal in magnitude.\n\nIn all of these machines, the density of the particles in the plasma is very low, often described as a \"poor vacuum\". This limits its approach to the triple product along the temperature and time axis. This requires magnetic fields on the order of tens of [[Tesla (unit)|Teslas]], currents in the megaampere, and confinement times on the order of tens of seconds.<ref>[http://www.jet.efda.org/fusion-basics/conditions-for-a-fusion-reaction/ \"Conditions for a fusion reaction\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114032026/http://www.jet.efda.org/fusion-basics/conditions-for-a-fusion-reaction/ |date=January 14, 2011 }}, JET</ref> Generating currents of this magnitude is relatively simple, and a number of devices from large banks of [[capacitor]]s to [[homopolar generator]]s have been used. However, generating the required magnetic fields is another issue, generally requiring expensive [[superconducting magnet]]s. For any given reactor design, the cost is generally dominated by the cost of the magnets.\n\n==Beta==\nGiven that the magnets are a dominant factor in reactor design, and that density and temperature combine to produce pressure, the [[Ratio#Notation and terminology|ratio]] of the pressure of the plasma to the magnetic energy density naturally becomes a useful figure of merit when comparing MCF designs. In effect, the ratio illustrates how effectively a design confines its plasma. This ratio, beta, is widely used in the fusion field:\n\n: <math>\\beta = \\frac{p}{p_\\text{mag}} = \\frac{n k_B T}{B^2/2\\mu_0}</math><ref>Wesson, J: \"Tokamaks\", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>\n\n<math>\\beta</math> is normally measured in terms of the total magnetic field. However, in any real-world design, the strength of the field varies over the volume of the plasma, so to be specific, the average beta is sometimes referred to as the \"beta toroidal\". In the tokamak design the total field is a combination of the external toroidal field and the current-induced poloidal one, so the \"beta poloidal\" is sometimes used to compare the relative strengths of these fields. And as the external magnetic field is the driver of reactor cost, \"beta external\" is used to consider just this contribution.\n\n===Troyon beta limit===\nIn a [[tokamak]], for a stable plasma, <math>\\beta</math> is always much smaller than 1 (otherwise it would collapse).<ref>Kenr\u014d Miyamoto, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=-tLq4hzVnN8C&pg=PA62 \"Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion\"], Springer, 2005 , pg. 62</ref> Ideally, a MCF device would want to have as high beta as possible, as this would imply the minimum amount of magnetic force needed for confinement. In practice, most tokamaks  operate at beta of order 0.01, or 1%. Spherical tokamaks typically operate at beta values an order of magnitude higher. The record was set by the [[Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak|START]] device at 0.4, or 40%.<ref>Alan Sykes, [http://www.triam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ICPP/program/download/12-PL01.pdf \"The Development of the Spherical Tokamak\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072454/http://www.triam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ICPP/program/download/12-PL01.pdf |date=July 22, 2011 }}, ICPP, Fukuoka September 2008</ref>\n\nThese low achievable betas are due to [[plasma instability|instabilities in the plasma]] generated through the interaction of the fields and the motion of the particles due to the induced current. As the amount of current is increased in relation to the external field, these instabilities become uncontrollable. In early pinch experiments the current dominated the field components and the kink and sausage instabilities were common, today collectively referred to as \"low-n instabilities\". As the relative strength of the external magnetic field is increased, these simple instabilities are damped out, but at a critical field other \"high-n instabilities\" will invariably appear, notably the [[ballooning mode]]. For any given fusion reactor design, there is a limit to the beta it can sustain. As beta is a measure of economic merit, a practical tokamak based fusion reactor must be able to sustain a beta above some critical value, which is calculated to be around 5%.<ref>[http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/local/scenario/talks/Goldston_SLAC.ppt \"Scientific Progress in Magnetic Fusion, ITER, and the Fusion Development Path\"], SLAC Colloquium, 21 April 2003, pg. 17</ref>\n\nThrough the 1980s the understanding of the high-n instabilities grew considerably. Shafranov and Yurchenko first published on the issue in 1971 in a general discussion of tokamak design, but it was the work by Wesson and Sykes in 1983<ref>Alan Sykes et all, ''Proceedings of 11th European Conference on Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics'', 1983, pg. 363</ref> and Francis Troyon in 1984<ref>F. Troyon et all, ''Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion'', Volume 26, pg. 209</ref> that developed these concepts fully. Troyon's considerations, or the \"Troyon limit\", closely matched the real-world performance of existing machines. It has since become so widely used that it is often known simply as ''the'' beta limit in tokamaks.\n\nThe Troyon limit is given as:\n\n: <math>\\beta_\\text{max} = \\frac{\\beta_N I}{a B_0}</math><ref name=f379>Friedberg, pg. 397</ref>\n\nWhere ''I'' is the plasma current, <math>B_0</math> is the external magnetic field, and a is the minor radius of the tokamak (see [[torus]] for an explanation of the directions). <math>\\beta_N</math> was determined numerically, and is normally given as 0.028 if ''I'' is measured in megaamperes. However, it is also common to use 2.8 if <math>\\beta_\\text{max}</math> is expressed as a percentage.<ref name=f379/>\n\nGiven that the Troyon limit suggested a <math>\\beta_\\text{max}</math> around 2.5 to 4%, and a practical reactor had to have a <math>\\beta_\\text{max}</math> around 5%, the Troyon limit was a serious concern when it was introduced. However, it was found that <math>\\beta_N</math> changed dramatically with the shape of the plasma, and non-circular systems would have much better performance. Experiments on the [[DIII-D]] machine (the second D referring to the cross-sectional shape of the plasma) demonstrated higher performance,<ref>T. Taylor, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10104172-nWRS2S/webviewable/10104172.pdf \"Experimental Achievement of Toroidal Beta Beyond That Predicted by 'Troyon' Scaling\"], General Atomics, September 1994</ref>  and the [[spherical tokamak]] design outperformed the Troyon limit by about 10 times.<ref>Sykes, pg. 29</ref>\n\n===Astrophysics===\nBeta is also sometimes used when discussing the interaction of plasma in space with different magnetic fields. A common example is the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the magnetic fields of the [[Sun]]<ref name=h>Alan Hood, [http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~alan/sun_course/Chapter3/node3.html \"The Plasma Beta\"], Magnetohydrostatic Equilibria, 11 January 2000</ref> or [[Earth]].<ref>G. Haerendel et all, \"High-beta plasma blobs in the morningside plasma sheet\", ''Annales Geophysicae'', Volume 17 Number 12, pg. 1592-1601</ref> In this case, the betas of these natural phenomena are generally much smaller than those seen in reactor designs; the Sun's [[solar corona|corona]] has a beta around 1%.<ref name=h/> Active regions have much higher beta, over 1 in some cases, which makes the area unstable.<ref>G. Allan Gary, [http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/papers/garyga/PlasmaBeta.pdf \"Plasma Beta Above a Solar Active region: Rethinking the Paradigm\"], ''Solar Physics'', Volume 203 (2001), pg. 71\u201386</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n*[[Plasma (physics)]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Joan Lisa Bromberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECOvgg7b3MQC \"Fusion: Science, Politics, and the Invention of a New Energy Source\"], MIT Press, 1982\n* Jeffrey Freidberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyoe88GEVz4C \"Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy\"], Cambridge University Press, 2007\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n", "text_old": "The '''beta''' of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], symbolized by ''\u03b2'', is the ratio of the plasma [[pressure]] (''p'' = [[Number density|''n'']] [[Boltzmann's constant|''k''<sub>B</sub>]] [[Temperature|''T'']]) to the [[magnetic pressure]] (''p''<sub>mag</sub> = [[Magnetic field|''B'']]\u00b2/2[[Permeability (electromagnetism)|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]]).

As beta is a measure of economic merit, a practical tokamak based fusion reactor must be able to sustain a beta above some critical value, which is calculated to be around 5%.<ref>[http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/local/scenario/talks/Goldston_SLAC.ppt \"Scientific Progress in Magnetic Fusion, ITER, and the Fusion Development Path\"], SLAC Colloquium, 21 April 2003, pg. 17</ref>\n\nThrough the 1980s the understanding of the high-n instabilities grew considerably. Shafranov and Yurchenko first published on the issue in 1971 in a general discussion of tokamak design, but it was the work by Wesson and Sykes in 1983<ref>Alan Sykes et all, ''Proceedings of 11th European Conference on Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics'', 1983, pg. 363</ref> and Francis Troyon in 1984<ref>F. Troyon et all, ''Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion'', Volume 26, pg. 209</ref> that developed these concepts fully. Troyon's considerations, or the \"Troyon limit\", closely matched the real-world performance of existing machines. It has since become so widely used that it is often known simply as ''the'' beta limit in tokamaks.\n\nThe Troyon limit is given as:\n\n: <math>\\beta_\\text{max} = \\frac{\\beta_N I}{a B_0}</math><ref name=f379>Friedberg, pg. 397</ref>\n\nWhere ''I'' is the plasma current, <math>B_0</math> is the external magnetic field, and a is the minor radius of the tokamak (see [[torus]] for an explanation of the directions). <math>\\beta_N</math> was determined numerically, and is normally given as 0.028 if ''I'' is measured in megaamperes. However, it is also common to use 2.8 if <math>\\beta_\\text{max}</math> is expressed as a percentage.<ref name=f379/>\n\nGiven that the Troyon limit suggested a <math>\\beta_\\text{max}</math> around 2.5 to 4%, and a practical reactor had to have a <math>\\beta_\\text{max}</math> around 5%, the Troyon limit was a serious concern when it was introduced. However, it was found that <math>\\beta_N</math> changed dramatically with the shape of the plasma, and non-circular systems would have much better performance. Experiments on the [[DIII-D]] machine (the second D referring to the cross-sectional shape of the plasma) demonstrated higher performance,<ref>T.

A common example is the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the magnetic fields of the [[Sun]]<ref name=h>Alan Hood, [http://www-solar.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~alan/sun_course/Chapter3/node3.html \"The Plasma Beta\"], Magnetohydrostatic Equilibria, 11 January 2000</ref> or [[Earth]].<ref>G. Haerendel et all, \"High-beta plasma blobs in the morningside plasma sheet\", ''Annales Geophysicae'', Volume 17 Number 12, pg. 1592-1601</ref> In this case, the betas of these natural phenomena are generally much smaller than those seen in reactor designs; the Sun's [[corona]] has a beta around 1%.<ref name=h/> Active regions have much higher beta, over 1 in some cases, which makes the area unstable.<ref>G.
