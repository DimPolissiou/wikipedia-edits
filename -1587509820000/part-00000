The MUP described a police interview they held in the lead-up to the meeting in Cetinje with Bobo Bogdanovi\u0107, a representative of the Committee, and Abramovi\u0107. They stated that they \"thought it was only fair to let Mr Abramovi\u0107 know that this information and these documents were known not only to the SDB, but to the people that sustained not only injuries but violations of dignity from these acts, before he accept any public position\".

On 30 November, Metropolitan Theodosius informed the SOC as well as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]] that the \"elderly and deluded\" Abramovi\u0107 \"was falsely representing himself as an auxiliary (Vicar) bishop of Edmonton (Canada)\" since he \"was never consecrated\" as such.

On 30 November, Metropolitan Theodosius informed the SOC as well as [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]] that the \"elderly and deluded\" Abramovi\u0107 \"was falsely representing himself as an auxiliary (Vicar) bishop of Edmonton (Canada)\" since he \"was never consecrated\" as such.

There are several conflicting stories. In one, his lip was cut by shrapnel when his ship (the {{USS|Leviathan|ID-1326|6}}) was shelled. The ship was never shelled, however, and it is believed that Bogart was not at sea before the armistice. Another story, held by longtime friend [[Nathaniel Benchley]], was that Bogart was injured while taking a prisoner to [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in [[Kittery, Maine]]. While changing trains in [[Boston]], the handcuffed prisoner reportedly asked Bogart for a cigarette. When Bogart looked for a match, the prisoner smashed him across the mouth with the cuffs (cutting Bogart's lip) and fled before he was recaptured and imprisoned. In an alternative version, Bogart was struck in the mouth by a handcuff loosened while freeing his charge; the other handcuff was still around the prisoner's wrist.<ref>Citro et al. 2005, pp. 240\u2013241.</ref> By the time Bogart was treated by a doctor, a scar had formed. [[David Niven]] said that when he first asked Bogart about his scar, however, he said that it was caused by a childhood accident. \"Goddamn doctor\", Bogart later told Niven. \"Instead of stitching it up, he screwed it up.\" According to Niven, the stories that Bogart got the scar during wartime were made up by the studios. His post-service physical did not mention the lip scar, although it noted many smaller scars.<ref name=\"Sperber p.27\" /> When actress [[Louise Brooks]] met Bogart in 1924, he had scar tissue on his upper lip which Brooks said Bogart may have had partially repaired before entering the film industry in 1930.<ref name=\"Meyers_p18-19\" /> Brooks said that his \"lip wound gave him no speech impediment, either before or after it was mended.\"{{quote without source|date=February 2020}}\n\n== <span id=\"Turn to acting\"></span>Acting ==\n=== First performances ===\nBogart returned home to find his father in poor health, his medical practice faltering, and much of the family's wealth lost in bad timber investments.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 28.</ref> His character and values developed separate from his family during his navy days, and he began to rebel.

The [[C. S. Forester]] novel on which it was based was overlooked and left undeveloped for 15 years, until producer [[Sam Spiegel]] and Huston bought the rights. Spiegel sent Katharine Hepburn the book; she suggested Bogart for the male lead, believing that \"he was the only man who could have played that part\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 439.</ref> Huston's love of adventure, his deep, longstanding friendship (and success) with Bogart, and the chance to work with Hepburn convinced the actor to leave Hollywood for a difficult shoot on location in the [[Belgian Congo]]. Bogart was to get 30 percent of the profits and Hepburn 10 percent, plus a relatively-small salary for both. The stars met in London, and announced that they would work together.\n\nBacall came for the over-four-month duration, leaving their young son in Los Angeles. The Bogarts began the trip with a [[Film promotion|junket]] through Europe, including a visit with [[Pope Pius XII]].<ref name=Meyers_p248>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=248.}}</ref> Bacall later made herself useful as a cook, nurse and clothes washer; her husband said: \"I don't know what we'd have done without her.

When Bogart won, however, he said: \"It's a long way from the Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much&nbsp;... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now.\" Despite the award and its accompanying recognition, Bogart later said: \"The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one&nbsp;... too many stars&nbsp;... win it and then figure they have to top themselves&nbsp;... they become afraid to take chances.

The character of Queeg was similar to his roles in ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''Casablanca'' and ''The Big Sleep''\u2013the wary loner who trusts no one\u2014but without their warmth and humor. Like his portrayal of Fred C. Dobbs in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', Bogart's Queeg is a paranoid, self-pitying character whose small-mindedness eventually destroys him. [[Henry Fonda]] played a different role in the Broadway version of ''The Caine Mutiny'', generating publicity for the film.<ref name=Meyers_p279-280>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=279\u2013280.}}</ref>\n\n=== Final roles ===\n\n[[File:Sabrina8.jpg|thumb|alt=Bogart and Audrey Hepburn dancing|Bogart and Audrey Hepburn in a trailer for ''Sabrina'']]\nFor ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), [[Billy Wilder]] wanted [[Cary Grant]] for the older male lead and chose Bogart to play the conservative brother who competes with his younger, playboy sibling ([[William Holden]]) for the affection of the Cinderella-like Sabrina ([[Audrey Hepburn]]). Although Bogart was lukewarm about the part, he agreed to it on a handshake with Wilder without a finished script but with the director's assurance that he would take good care of Bogart during filming.<ref name=Meyers_p281>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=281.}}</ref> The actor, however, got along poorly with his director and co-stars; he complained about the script's last-minute drafting and delivery, and accused Wilder of favoring Hepburn and Holden on and off the set. Wilder was the opposite of Bogart's ideal director (John Huston) in style and personality; Bogart complained to the press that Wilder was \"overbearing\" and \"is [a] kind of [[Prussia]]n German with a riding crop. He is the type of director I don't like to work with&nbsp;... the picture is a crock of crap. I got sick and tired of who gets Sabrina.\"<ref name=Meyers_p283>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=283.}}</ref> Wilder later said, \"We parted as enemies but finally made up.\" Despite the acrimony, the film was successful; according to a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Bogart was \"incredibly adroit&nbsp;... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 495.</ref>\n\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Barefoot Contessa trailer.jpg|thumb|alt=Bogart, with his name on the screen|Bogart in a trailer for ''The Barefoot Contessa'']]\n[[Joseph L.

Bogart performed radio adaptations of some of his best-known films, such as ''Casablanca'' and ''The Maltese Falcon'', and recorded a radio series entitled ''[[Bold Venture]]'' with Bacall.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Children ===\nBogart became a father at age 49, when Bacall gave birth to [[Stephen Humphrey Bogart]] on January 6, 1949 during the filming of ''Tokyo Joe''.<ref name=\"Bacall\" /> The name was taken from Steve, Bogart's character's nickname in ''To Have and Have Not''.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 422.</ref> Stephen became an author and biographer, and hosted a television special about his father on [[Turner Classic Movies]]. The couple's daughter, Leslie Howard Bogart, was born on August 23, 1952. Her first and middle names honor Leslie Howard, Bogart's friend and co-star in ''The Petrified Forest''.<ref name=\"shickelbook\" /><ref name=\"Bacall\" />\n\n=== Rat Pack ===\nBogart was a founding member and the original leader of the Hollywood [[Rat Pack]]. In the spring of 1955, after a long party in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] attended by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Judy Garland]], her husband [[Sidney Luft]], [[Michael Romanoff]] and his wife Gloria, [[David Niven]], [[Angie Dickinson]] and others, Bacall surveyed the wreckage and said: \"You look like a goddamn rat pack.\"<ref name=\"sperber p. 504.\">Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 504.</ref>\n\nThe name stuck, and was made official at Romanoff's in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. Sinatra was dubbed Pack Leader; Bacall Den Mother; Bogart Director of Public Relations, and Sid Luft Acting Cage Manager.<ref name=\"sperber p. 430.\">Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 430.</ref> Asked by columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] what the group's purpose was, Bacall replied: \"To drink a lot of bourbon and stay up late.\"<ref name=\"sperber p. 504.\" />\n\n=== Illness and death ===\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart Grave.JPG|thumb|alt=Marble stone with a simple plaque|Bogart's grave in the Garden of Memory of Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California]]\nAfter signing a long-term deal with Warner Bros., Bogart predicted with glee that his teeth and hair would fall out before the contract ended. In 1955, however, his health was failing. In the wake of Santana, Bogart had formed a new company and had plans for a film (''[[John P. Marquand#Popular fiction|Melville Goodwin]], U.S.A.'') in which he would play a general and Bacall a press magnate. His persistent cough and difficulty eating became too serious to ignore, though, and he dropped the project.<ref>The film was subsequently renamed ''Top Secret Affair'' and made with Kirk Douglas and Susan Hayward: Sperber and Lax 1997, pp. 509\u2013510.</ref>\n\nA heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart had developed [[esophageal cancer]]. He did not talk about his health, and visited a doctor in January 1956 after considerable persuasion from Bacall. The disease worsened several weeks later, and on March 1 Bogart had surgery to remove his [[esophagus]], two [[lymph node]]s and a rib. The surgery was unsuccessful, and [[chemotherapy]] followed.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 510.</ref> He had additional surgery in November 1956, when the cancer had spread.<ref name=\"shickelbook\" /> Although Bogart became too weak to walk up and down stairs, he joked despite the pain: \"Put me in the [[dumbwaiter]] and I'll ride down to the first floor in style.\" It was then altered to accommodate his wheelchair.<ref>Bacall 1978, p. 273.</ref> Sinatra, Katharine Hepburn, and Spencer Tracy visited Bogart on January 13, 1957. In an interview, Hepburn said:\n\n{{quote|Spence patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Goodnight, Bogie.\" Bogie turned his eyes to Spence very quietly and with a sweet smile covered Spence's hand with his own and said, \"Goodbye, Spence.\" Spence's heart stood still. He understood.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 516.</ref> }}\n\nBogart lapsed into a coma and died the following day, 20 days after his 57th birthday; at the time of his death he weighed only {{convert|80|lb|kg}}. A simple funeral was held at All Saints Episcopal Church, with music by Bogart's favorite composers: [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Claude Debussy]]. In attendance were some of Hollywood's biggest stars, including Hepburn, Tracy, Judy Garland, David Niven, [[Ronald Reagan]], [[James Mason]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Joan Fontaine]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[James Cagney]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Billy Wilder]] and studio head Jack L. Warner. Bacall asked Tracy to give the eulogy; he was too upset, however, and John Huston spoke instead:\n\n{{quote|Himself, he never took too seriously\u2014his work most seriously. He regarded the somewhat gaudy figure of Bogart, the star, with an amused cynicism; Bogart, the actor, he held in deep respect&nbsp;... In each of the fountains at Versailles there is a pike which keeps all the carp active; otherwise they would grow over-fat and die. Bogie took rare delight in performing a similar duty in the fountains of Hollywood. Yet his victims seldom bore him any malice, and when they did, not for long. His shafts were fashioned only to stick into the outer layer of complacency, and not to penetrate through to the regions of the spirit where real injuries are done&nbsp;... He is quite irreplaceable. There will never be another like him.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 518.</ref> }}\n\nBogart was cremated, and his ashes were interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]]'s Columbarium of Eternal Light in its Garden of Memory in [[Glendale, California]]. He was buried with a small, gold whistle which had been part of a charm bracelet he had given to Bacall before they married. On it was inscribed, \"If you want anything, just whistle.\" This alluded to a scene in ''To Have and Have Not'' when Bacall's character says to Bogart shortly after their first meeting, \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.\"<ref name=Meyers_p315>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=315.}}</ref>\nBogart's estate had a gross value of $910,146 and a net value of $737,668 (${{Inflation|US|0.910146|1957|r=1|fmt=c}} million and ${{Inflation|US|0.737668|1957|r=1|fmt=c}} million, respectively, in {{Inflation-year|US}}).<ref>Mendel, Stephen A.

There are several conflicting stories. In one, his lip was cut by shrapnel when his ship (the {{USS|Leviathan|ID-1326|6}}) was shelled. The ship was never shelled, however, and it is believed that Bogart was not at sea before the armistice. Another story, held by longtime friend [[Nathaniel Benchley]], was that Bogart was injured while taking a prisoner to [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in [[Kittery, Maine]]. While changing trains in [[Boston]], the handcuffed prisoner reportedly asked Bogart for a cigarette. When Bogart looked for a match, the prisoner smashed him across the mouth with the cuffs (cutting Bogart's lip) and fled before he was recaptured and imprisoned. In an alternative version, Bogart was struck in the mouth by a handcuff loosened while freeing his charge; the other handcuff was still around the prisoner's wrist.<ref>Citro et al. 2005, pp. 240\u2013241.</ref> By the time Bogart was treated by a doctor, a scar had formed. [[David Niven]] said that when he first asked Bogart about his scar, however, he said that it was caused by a childhood accident. \"Goddamn doctor\", Bogart later told Niven. \"Instead of stitching it up, he screwed it up.\" According to Niven, the stories that Bogart got the scar during wartime were made up by the studios. His post-service physical did not mention the lip scar, although it noted many smaller scars.<ref name=\"Sperber p.27\" /> When actress [[Louise Brooks]] met Bogart in 1924, he had scar tissue on his upper lip which Brooks said Bogart may have had partially repaired before entering the film industry in 1930.<ref name=\"Meyers_p18-19\" /> Brooks said that his \"lip wound gave him no speech impediment, either before or after it was mended.\"{{quote without source|date=February 2020}}\n\n== <span id=\"Turn to acting\"></span>Acting ==\n=== First performances ===\nBogart returned home to find his father in poor health, his medical practice faltering, and much of the family's wealth lost in bad timber investments.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 28.</ref> His character and values developed separate from his family during his navy days, and he began to rebel.

Santana also made two films without him: ''[[And Baby Makes Three]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Family Secret (1951 film)|The Family Secret]]'' (1951).\n\nAlthough most lost money at the box office (ultimately forcing Santana's sale), at least two retain a reputation; ''In a Lonely Place'' is considered a film-noir high point. Bogart plays Dixon Steele, an embittered writer with a violent reputation who is the primary suspect in the murder of a young woman and falls in love with failed actress Laurel Gray ([[Gloria Grahame]]).<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/18/archives/the-screen-three-films-make-their-bows-humphrey-bogart-movie-in-a.html|title=Three Films Make Their Bows; Humphrey Bogart Movie, ''In a Lonely Place,'' at Paramount \u2013Import at Trans-Lux ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' Starring Betty Hutton, Is Presented at Loew's State Theatre|work=The New York Times|date=May 18, 1950|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref> Several Bogart biographers, and actress-writer Louise Brooks, have felt that this role is closest to the real Bogart. According to Brooks, the film \"gave him a role that he could play with complexity, because the film character's pride in his art, his selfishness, drunkenness, lack of energy stabbed with lightning strokes of violence were shared by the real Bogart\". The character mimics some of Bogart's personal habits, twice ordering the actor's favorite meal (ham and eggs).<ref name=Meyers_p240-241>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=240\u2013241.}}</ref>\n\nA parody of sorts of ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''Beat the Devil'' was the final film for Bogart and [[John Huston]].

The [[C. S. Forester]] novel on which it was based was overlooked and left undeveloped for 15 years, until producer [[Sam Spiegel]] and Huston bought the rights. Spiegel sent Katharine Hepburn the book; she suggested Bogart for the male lead, believing that \"he was the only man who could have played that part\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 439.</ref> Huston's love of adventure, his deep, longstanding friendship (and success) with Bogart, and the chance to work with Hepburn convinced the actor to leave Hollywood for a difficult shoot on location in the [[Belgian Congo]]. Bogart was to get 30 percent of the profits and Hepburn 10 percent, plus a relatively-small salary for both. The stars met in London, and announced that they would work together.\n\nBacall came for the over-four-month duration, leaving their young son in Los Angeles. The Bogarts began the trip with a [[Film promotion|junket]] through Europe, including a visit with [[Pope Pius XII]].<ref name=Meyers_p248>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=248.}}</ref> Bacall later made herself useful as a cook, nurse and clothes washer; her husband said: \"I don't know what we'd have done without her. She [[Lux (soap)|Luxed]] my undies in darkest Africa.\"<ref name=Meyers_p249>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=249.}}</ref> Nearly everyone in the cast developed [[dysentery]] except Bogart and Huston, who subsisted on canned food and alcohol; Bogart said, \"All I ate was baked beans, canned [[asparagus]] and [[Scotch whisky]]. Whenever a fly bit Huston or me, it dropped dead.\"<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 444.</ref> Hepburn (a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]]) fared worse in the difficult conditions, losing weight and at one point becoming very ill. Bogart resisted Huston's insistence on using real [[leech]]es in a key scene where Charlie has to drag his steam launch through an infested marsh, and reasonable fakes were employed.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 447.</ref> The crew overcame illness, [[Army ant|army-ant]] infestations, leaky boats, poor food, attacking [[hippopotamus|hippos]], poor water filters, extreme heat, isolation, and a boat fire to complete the film.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, pp. 444\u2013445.</ref> Despite the discomfort of jumping from the boat into swamps, rivers and marshes, ''The African Queen'' apparently rekindled Bogart's early love of boats; when he returned to California, he bought a classic mahogany [[Hacker-Craft]] runabout which he kept until his death.\n\nHis performance as cantankerous skipper Charlie Allnutt earned Bogart an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1951 (his only award of three nominations), and he considered it the best of his film career.<ref name=Meyers_p258>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=258.}}</ref> Promising friends that if he won his speech would break the convention of thanking everyone in sight, Bogart advised [[Claire Trevor]] when she was nominated for ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' to \"just say you did it all yourself and don't thank anyone\". When Bogart won, however, he said: \"It's a long way from the Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much&nbsp;... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now.\" Despite the award and its accompanying recognition, Bogart later said: \"The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one&nbsp;... too many stars&nbsp;... win it and then figure they have to top themselves&nbsp;... they become afraid to take chances. The result: A lot of dull performances in dull pictures.\"<ref name=Meyers_p259-260>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=259\u2013260.}}</ref> ''The African Queen'' was Bogart's first starring [[Technicolor]] role.\n\n=== ''The Caine Mutiny'' ===\n[[File:Queeg A.jpg|thumb|alt=Bogart in Navy dress uniform with Fred MacMurray and other officers in a trailer for The Caine Mutiny|Bogart as the paranoid Captain Queeg in ''The Caine Mutiny'' (1954)]]\nBogart dropped his asking price to obtain the role of Captain Queeg in [[Edward Dmytryk]]'s drama, ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1954). Though he retained some of his old bitterness about having to do so,<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 480.</ref> he delivered a strong performance in the lead; he received his final Oscar nomination and was the subject of a June 7, 1954 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story.\n\nDespite his success, Bogart was still [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]; he grumbled to (and feuded with) the studio, while his health  began to deteriorate. The character of Queeg was similar to his roles in ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''Casablanca'' and ''The Big Sleep''\u2013the wary loner who trusts no one\u2014but without their warmth and humor. Like his portrayal of Fred C. Dobbs in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', Bogart's Queeg is a paranoid, self-pitying character whose small-mindedness eventually destroys him. [[Henry Fonda]] played a different role in the Broadway version of ''The Caine Mutiny'', generating publicity for the film.<ref name=Meyers_p279-280>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=279\u2013280.}}</ref>\n\n=== Final roles ===\n\n[[File:Sabrina8.jpg|thumb|alt=Bogart and Audrey Hepburn dancing|Bogart and Audrey Hepburn in a trailer for ''Sabrina'']]\nFor ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), [[Billy Wilder]] wanted [[Cary Grant]] for the older male lead and chose Bogart to play the conservative brother who competes with his younger, playboy sibling ([[William Holden]]) for the affection of the Cinderella-like Sabrina ([[Audrey Hepburn]]). Although Bogart was lukewarm about the part, he agreed to it on a handshake with Wilder without a finished script but with the director's assurance that he would take good care of Bogart during filming.<ref name=Meyers_p281>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=281.}}</ref> The actor, however, got along poorly with his director and co-stars; he complained about the script's last-minute drafting and delivery, and accused Wilder of favoring Hepburn and Holden on and off the set. Wilder was the opposite of Bogart's ideal director (John Huston) in style and personality; Bogart complained to the press that Wilder was \"overbearing\" and \"is [a] kind of [[Prussia]]n German with a riding crop. He is the type of director I don't like to work with&nbsp;... the picture is a crock of crap. I got sick and tired of who gets Sabrina.\"<ref name=Meyers_p283>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=283.}}</ref> Wilder later said, \"We parted as enemies but finally made up.\" Despite the acrimony, the film was successful; according to a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Bogart was \"incredibly adroit&nbsp;... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 495.</ref>\n\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Barefoot Contessa trailer.jpg|thumb|alt=Bogart, with his name on the screen|Bogart in a trailer for ''The Barefoot Contessa'']]\n[[Joseph L.

In this Hollywood backstory Bogart is a broken-down man, a cynical director-narrator who saves his career by making a star of a [[flamenco]] dancer modeled on [[Rita Hayworth]]. He was uneasy with [[Ava Gardner]] in the female lead; she had just broken up with his [[Rat Pack]] buddy [[Frank Sinatra]], and Bogart was  annoyed by her inexperienced performance. The actor was generally praised as the film's strongest part.<ref name=Meyers_p288-290>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=288\u2013290.}}</ref> During filming and while Bacall was home, Bogart resumed his discreet affair with [[Verita Bouvaire-Thompson]] (his long-time studio assistant, whom he drank with and took sailing). When Bacall found them together, she extracted an expensive shopping spree from her husband; the three traveled together after the shooting.<ref name=Meyers_p291-292>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=291\u2013292.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart and Mike Lane 1956.jpg|thumb|alt=Bogart with his hand on the shoulder of a seated Mike Lane|Bogart and [[Mike Lane]] in ''[[The Harder They Fall]]'']]\nBogart could be generous with actors, particularly those who were blacklisted, down on their luck or having personal problems. During the filming of the [[Edward Dmytryk]]-directed ''[[The Left Hand of God]]'' (1955), he noticed his co-star [[Gene Tierney]] having a hard time remembering her lines and behaving oddly; he coached Tierney, feeding her lines.

Murrow]]'s ''[[Person to Person]]'' and disagreed on the answer to every question. He also appeared on ''[[The Jack Benny Program|The Jack Benny Show]]'', where a surviving [[kinescope]] of the live telecast captures him in his only TV sketch-comedy performance. Bogart and Bacall worked on an early color telecast in 1955, an [[NBC]] adaptation of ''The Petrified Forest'' for ''[[Producers' Showcase]]''. Bogart received [[Billing (performing arts)|top billing]], and [[Henry Fonda]] played Leslie Howard's role; a [[black and white]] kinescope of the live telecast has survived. Bogart performed radio adaptations of some of his best-known films, such as ''Casablanca'' and ''The Maltese Falcon'', and recorded a radio series entitled ''[[Bold Venture]]'' with Bacall.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Children ===\nBogart became a father at age 49, when Bacall gave birth to [[Stephen Humphrey Bogart]] on January 6, 1949 during the filming of ''Tokyo Joe''.<ref name=\"Bacall\" /> The name was taken from Steve, Bogart's character's nickname in ''To Have and Have Not''.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 422.</ref> Stephen became an author and biographer, and hosted a television special about his father on [[Turner Classic Movies]].

In the spring of 1955, after a long party in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] attended by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Judy Garland]], her husband [[Sidney Luft]], [[Michael Romanoff]] and his wife Gloria, [[David Niven]], [[Angie Dickinson]] and others, Bacall surveyed the wreckage and said: \"You look like a goddamn rat pack.\"<ref name=\"sperber p. 504.\">Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 504.</ref>\n\nThe name stuck, and was made official at Romanoff's in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].

In 1955, however, his health was failing. In the wake of Santana, Bogart had formed a new company and had plans for a film (''[[John P. Marquand#Popular fiction|Melville Goodwin]], U.S.A.'') in which he would play a general and Bacall a press magnate. His persistent cough and difficulty eating became too serious to ignore, though, and he dropped the project.<ref>The film was subsequently renamed ''Top Secret Affair'' and made with Kirk Douglas and Susan Hayward: Sperber and Lax 1997, pp. 509\u2013510.</ref>\n\nA heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart had developed [[esophageal cancer]]. He did not talk about his health, and visited a doctor in January 1956 after considerable persuasion from Bacall. The disease worsened several weeks later, and on March 1 Bogart had surgery to remove his [[esophagus]], two [[lymph node]]s and a rib. The surgery was unsuccessful, and [[chemotherapy]] followed.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 510.</ref> He had additional surgery in November 1956, when the cancer had spread.<ref name=\"shickelbook\" /> Although Bogart became too weak to walk up and down stairs, he joked despite the pain: \"Put me in the [[dumbwaiter]] and I'll ride down to the first floor in style.\" It was then altered to accommodate his wheelchair.<ref>Bacall 1978, p. 273.</ref> Sinatra, Katharine Hepburn, and Spencer Tracy visited Bogart on January 13, 1957. In an interview, Hepburn said:\n\n{{quote|Spence patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Goodnight, Bogie.\" Bogie turned his eyes to Spence very quietly and with a sweet smile covered Spence's hand with his own and said, \"Goodbye, Spence.\" Spence's heart stood still. He understood.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 516.</ref> }}\n\nBogart lapsed into a coma and died the following day, 20 days after his 57th birthday; at the time of his death he weighed only {{convert|80|lb|kg}}. A simple funeral was held at All Saints Episcopal Church, with music by Bogart's favorite composers: [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Claude Debussy]]. In attendance were some of Hollywood's biggest stars, including Hepburn, Tracy, Judy Garland, David Niven, [[Ronald Reagan]], [[James Mason]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Joan Fontaine]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[James Cagney]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Billy Wilder]] and studio head Jack L. Warner. Bacall asked Tracy to give the eulogy; he was too upset, however, and John Huston spoke instead:\n\n{{quote|Himself, he never took too seriously\u2014his work most seriously. He regarded the somewhat gaudy figure of Bogart, the star, with an amused cynicism; Bogart, the actor, he held in deep respect&nbsp;... In each of the fountains at Versailles there is a pike which keeps all the carp active; otherwise they would grow over-fat and die. Bogie took rare delight in performing a similar duty in the fountains of Hollywood. Yet his victims seldom bore him any malice, and when they did, not for long. His shafts were fashioned only to stick into the outer layer of complacency, and not to penetrate through to the regions of the spirit where real injuries are done&nbsp;... He is quite irreplaceable. There will never be another like him.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 518.</ref> }}\n\nBogart was cremated, and his ashes were interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]]'s Columbarium of Eternal Light in its Garden of Memory in [[Glendale, California]]. He was buried with a small, gold whistle which had been part of a charm bracelet he had given to Bacall before they married. On it was inscribed, \"If you want anything, just whistle.\" This alluded to a scene in ''To Have and Have Not'' when Bacall's character says to Bogart shortly after their first meeting, \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?

Wellman]] and stars [[James Cagney]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Edward Woods]], [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]], and [[Joan Blondell]]. The film relates the story of a young man's rise in the [[organized crime|criminal underworld]] in [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]-era urban America. The supporting players include [[Beryl Mercer]], [[Murray Kinnell]], and [[Mae Clarke]]. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel\u2014''Beer and Blood'' by two former newspapermen, [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]\u2014who had witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Whiteley |first1=Chris |title=The Public Enemy (1931) |url=http://www.hollywoodsgoldenage.com/movies/the_public_enemy.html |website=Hollywood's Golden Age 2010-18 |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/3860?sid|title=AFI&#124;Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Public Enemy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Public-Enemy-Cagney-Woods.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Cagney]] and [[Edward Woods]] in ''The Public Enemy'']]\nAs youngsters in 1900s Chicago, Irish-Americans Tom Powers ([[James Cagney]]) and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle ([[Edward Woods]]) engage in petty theft, selling their loot to \"Putty Nose\" ([[Murray Kinnell]]). Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. Chased by a cop, Tom and Matt have to gun him down. However, when they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has left town.\n\nTom's straightlaced older brother Mike Powers ([[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]]) tries, but fails, to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother ([[Beryl Mercer]]). When America enters [[World War I]] in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.\n\nIn 1920, with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan ([[Robert Emmett O'Connor]]) recruits Tom and Matt as beer \"salesmen\" (enforcers) in his [[Rum-runner|bootlegging]] business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \"Nails\" Nathan ([[Leslie Fenton]]). As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.\n\n[[File:L'Ennemi Public.png|thumb|James Cagney in ''The Public Enemy'']]\n\nMike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \"beer and blood\" (the title of the book upon which the film is based). Tom retorts in disgust: \"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\"\n\nTom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty (an uncredited [[Mae Clarke]]) and Mamie ([[Joan Blondell]]) respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; in a famous scene, when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen ([[Jean Harlow]]), a woman with a self-confessed weakness for bad men. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were kids. Tom shoots him in the back.\n\nTom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \"Nails\" Nathan dies in a horse riding accident, prompting Tom to find the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \"Schemer\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war.\n\nLater, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout, and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. Later, his dead body is returned to the Powers home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cagney]] as Tom Powers\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Gwen Allen\n* [[Edward Woods]] as Matt Doyle\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Mamie\n* [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] as Mike Powers\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Nails Nathan\n* [[Beryl Mercer]] as Ma Powers\n* [[Robert Emmett O'Connor]] as Paddy Ryan\n* [[Murray Kinnell]] as Putty Nose\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as Kitty (uncredited) \n* [[Frank Coghlan Jr.]] as Tom as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Frankie Darro]] as Matt as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Homans]] as Officer Pat Burke (uncredited) \n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as Headwaiter (uncredited)\n* [[Mia Marvin]] as Paddy Ryan's girlfriend (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThe screenplay which was written by Harvey F. Thew was based on a novel which was never published called ''Beer and Blood'', by [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. [[Warner Bros.]] studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] bought the rights to the novel and assigned director [[William A. Wellman]] to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I like the brother of the main character, told Zanuck: \"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\".\n\n===Casting===\n[[Edward Woods]] was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and [[James Cagney]] was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors<ref name=greatest_films/> but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in ''The Public Enemy'' was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, [[Jean Harlow]]. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \"Bess\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \"hated [[Hollywood]]\".<ref name=\"paris359\">Paris (1989), p. 359</ref> In the opinion of Brooks's biographer [[Barry Paris]], \"turning down ''Public Enemy'' marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\".<ref name=\"paris359\"/>\n\nTom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by [[Mae Clarke]], who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dropped off by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. [[Joan Blondell]] played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in ''[[Sinners' Holiday]]'' (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: ''[[God's Gift in Women]]'' and ''[[Blonde Crazy]]''. Other films that they worked together on were ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' (1932), ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' (1933) and ''[[He Was Her Man]]'' (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] played Tom's brother, Mike.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022286/business|title=Business Data for The Public Enemy (1931)|accessdate=2006-12-09|format=|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> During filming, Cagney also made ''[[Smart Money (1931 film)|Smart Money]]'', co-starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had finished his breakthrough film ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom,  Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment prior.<ref>Watson, Teresa.

Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|title=1978 interview with Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=Film Comment|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609102549/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|archivedate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=653428|title=The Men Who Made the Movies: William Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\nSome, such as film critic [[Ben Mankiewicz]], have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she hadn't been told to expect the unscripted action.<ref>[[Turner Classic Movies]] (October 17, 2010). ''The Public Enemy''</ref> However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do. She said that her only genuine surprise came later, when she saw the grapefruit take of the scene appear in the final film, as it had been her understanding that they were shooting it only as a joke to amuse the crew.<ref>Clarke, Mae.

The film relates the story of a young man's rise in the [[organized crime|criminal underworld]] in [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]-era urban America. The supporting players include [[Beryl Mercer]], [[Murray Kinnell]], and [[Mae Clarke]]. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel\u2014''Beer and Blood'' by two former newspapermen, [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]\u2014who had witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Whiteley |first1=Chris |title=The Public Enemy (1931) |url=http://www.hollywoodsgoldenage.com/movies/the_public_enemy.html |website=Hollywood's Golden Age 2010-18 |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/3860?sid|title=AFI&#124;Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Public Enemy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Public-Enemy-Cagney-Woods.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Cagney]] and [[Edward Woods]] in ''The Public Enemy'']]\nAs youngsters in 1900s Chicago, Irish-Americans Tom Powers ([[James Cagney]]) and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle ([[Edward Woods]]) engage in petty theft, selling their loot to \"Putty Nose\" ([[Murray Kinnell]]). Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. Chased by a cop, Tom and Matt have to gun him down. However, when they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has left town.\n\nTom's straightlaced older brother Mike Powers ([[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]]) tries, but fails, to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother ([[Beryl Mercer]]). When America enters [[World War I]] in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.\n\nIn 1920, with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan ([[Robert Emmett O'Connor]]) recruits Tom and Matt as beer \"salesmen\" (enforcers) in his [[Rum-runner|bootlegging]] business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \"Nails\" Nathan ([[Leslie Fenton]]). As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.\n\n[[File:L'Ennemi Public.png|thumb|James Cagney in ''The Public Enemy'']]\n\nMike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \"beer and blood\" (the title of the book upon which the film is based). Tom retorts in disgust: \"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\"\n\nTom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty (an uncredited [[Mae Clarke]]) and Mamie ([[Joan Blondell]]) respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; in a famous scene, when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen ([[Jean Harlow]]), a woman with a self-confessed weakness for bad men. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were kids. Tom shoots him in the back.\n\nTom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \"Nails\" Nathan dies in a horse riding accident, prompting Tom to find the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \"Schemer\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war.\n\nLater, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout, and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. Later, his dead body is returned to the Powers home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cagney]] as Tom Powers\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Gwen Allen\n* [[Edward Woods]] as Matt Doyle\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Mamie\n* [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] as Mike Powers\n* [[Leslie Fenton]] as Nails Nathan\n* [[Beryl Mercer]] as Ma Powers\n* [[Robert Emmett O'Connor]] as Paddy Ryan\n* [[Murray Kinnell]] as Putty Nose\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as Kitty (uncredited) \n* [[Frank Coghlan Jr.]] as Tom as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Frankie Darro]] as Matt as a Boy (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Homans]] as Officer Pat Burke (uncredited) \n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as Headwaiter (uncredited)\n* [[Mia Marvin]] as Paddy Ryan's girlfriend (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThe screenplay which was written by Harvey F. Thew was based on a novel which was never published called ''Beer and Blood'', by [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Kubec Glasmon]]. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of [[Al Capone]]'s murderous gang rivalries in [[Chicago]]. [[Warner Bros.]] studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] bought the rights to the novel and assigned director [[William A. Wellman]] to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I like the brother of the main character, told Zanuck: \"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\".\n\n===Casting===\n[[Edward Woods]] was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and [[James Cagney]] was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors<ref name=greatest_films/> but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in ''The Public Enemy'' was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Louise Brooks]] was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, [[Jean Harlow]]. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \"Bess\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \"hated [[Hollywood]]\".<ref name=\"paris359\">Paris (1989), p. 359</ref> In the opinion of Brooks's biographer [[Barry Paris]], \"turning down ''Public Enemy'' marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\".<ref name=\"paris359\"/>\n\nTom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by [[Mae Clarke]], who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dropped off by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. [[Joan Blondell]] played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in ''[[Sinners' Holiday]]'' (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: ''[[God's Gift in Women]]'' and ''[[Blonde Crazy]]''. Other films that they worked together on were ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' (1932), ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' (1933) and ''[[He Was Her Man]]'' (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. [[Donald Cook (actor)|Donald Cook]] played Tom's brother, Mike.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022286/business|title=Business Data for The Public Enemy (1931)|accessdate=2006-12-09|format=|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> During filming, Cagney also made ''[[Smart Money (1931 film)|Smart Money]]'', co-starring [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had finished his breakthrough film ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''.\n\nIn the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom,  Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment prior.<ref>Watson, Teresa.

Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|title=1978 interview with Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=Film Comment|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609102549/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/online/wellmanextra.htm|archivedate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=653428|title=The Men Who Made the Movies: William Wellman|accessdate=2008-06-05|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\nSome, such as film critic [[Ben Mankiewicz]], have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she hadn't been told to expect the unscripted action.<ref>[[Turner Classic Movies]] (October 17, 2010). ''The Public Enemy''</ref> However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do.

Years later a Tiger [[Hook-and-ladder truck|hook and ladder]] was purchased.  The fire department later shared a building with the police department and city hall on Higuera Street where Charles Shoes is located.  The building caught fire and was eventually demolished.  The original jail cells are still present in the rear store room of Charles Shoes.\n\n== EMS ==\nThe San Luis Obispo Fire Department is the primary provider of paramedic service in the city, in partnership with the transporting provider San Luis Ambulance.  Each fire apparatus is staffed with a minimum of one paramedic, working as a team with EMT's.  Most apparatus are staffed with two paramedics whenever staffing permits.  In the event of an ambulance shortage, the fire department's Medic Rescue 1 is utilized to provide for transport.  Medic Rescue 1 also responds to woodland and vegetation fires throughout the state, staffed with Fireline Paramedics, for firefighter safety.\n\n== Staffing ==\nThe on duty strength of the department is 14 personnel 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Three engine companies are staffed with three personnel, and the ladder truck is staffed with four personnel.  The battalion chief serves as the on duty supervisor for all crews and responds out of fire station 1.  Challenging economic times have kept the fire department staffing the same since 1978, when the call volume was approximately 1000 incidents per year.  Since that time, call volume has increased 600%, along with the addition of paramedic services, urban search and rescue, hazmat, and many other modern fire service programs.  Recent development in the city has sparked the possibility of a fifth fire station located in the Avila Ranch area near Buckley Road.  The environmental impact and fire master plan reports filed with the city show that the trigger point for increased fire department staffing will be in approximately 2024, where a two-person squad unit will be temporarily stationed within the Avila Ranch development.  Current call volume statistics reveal that workload should increase to approximately 9,000 incidents per year by that time.\n\n== Stations ==\nThe city has four fire stations spread throughout the city.  Station 1 has the paramedic quint ladder truck as its first out unit, the remaining stations have engine companies as their first out unit.  Fire station 4 cross staffs a type 3 fire engine.  Station 1 was constructed in 1996, replacing a seismically unsafe facility at the corner of Garden and Pismo.  The previous station was sold to a local developer and retrofitted for use as an office.

The English word \"white\" is said to have been derived by mistranslation of the Dutch word \"wijd\", which means \"wide\" in English. The word \"wide\" refers to the width of the rhinoceros's mou early English-speaking settlers in South Africa misinterpreted the \"wijd\" for \"white\" and the rhino with the wide mouth ended up being called the white rhino and the other one, with the narrow pointed mouth, was called the [[black rhinoceros]]. Ironically, Dutch (and Afrikaans) later used a [[calque]] of the English word, and now also call it a ''white'' rhino. This suggests the origin of the word was before codification by Dutch writers. A review of Dutch and Afrikaans literature about the rhinoceros has failed to produce any evidence that the word ''wijd'' was ever used to describe the rhino outside of oral use.<ref name=\"White rhino name\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=refs&CODE=ref_detail&id=1165243803|journal=Pachyderm|author=Rookmaaker, Kees|title=Why the name of the white rhinoceros is not appropriate|volume=34|pages=88\u201393|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative name for the white rhinoceros, more accurate but rarely used, is the square-lipped rhinoceros.

[[Herbivore]] [[Grazing (behaviour)|grazers]] that eat grass, preferring the shortest grains, the white rhinoceros is one of the largest pure grazers. It drinks twice a day if water is available, but if conditions are dry it can live four or five days without water. It spends about half of the day eating, one third resting, and the rest of the day doing various other things. White rhinoceroses, like all species of rhinoceros, love wallowing in mud holes to cool down. The white rhinoceros is thought to have changed the structure and ecology of the savanna's grasslands. Comparatively based on studies of the African elephant, scientists believe the white rhino is a driving factor in its ecosystem. The destruction of the megaherbivore could have serious cascading effects on the ecosystem and harm other animals.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12218|title=Restoration of a megaherbivore: Landscape-level impacts of white rhinoceros in Kruger National Park, South Africa|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=102|issue=3|pages=566\u2013575|year=2014|last1=Cromsigt|first1=J.

The white rhino is particularly vulnerable to hunting, because it is a large and relatively unaggressive animal with very poor eye sight and generally occurs in herds.\n\nDespite the lack of scientific evidence, the rhino horn is highly prized in traditional Asian medicine, where it is ground into a fine powder or manufactured into tablets to be used as a treatment for a variety of illnesses such as nosebleeds, strokes, convulsions, and fevers. Due to this demand, several highly organized and very profitable international poaching syndicates came into being and would carry out their poaching missions with advanced technologies ranging from night vision scopes, silenced weapons, darting equipment and even helicopters. The ongoing civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and incursions by poachers primarily coming from Sudan have further disrupted efforts to protect the few remaining northern rhinos.<ref name=WWF>{{cite web|url= http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/rhinoceros/african_rhinos/poaching_crisis_african_rhinos/|title=African rhino poaching crisis |publisher=[[World Wide Fund For Nature|WWF]]|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, poaching rates for white rhinos nearly doubled from the previous year. As a result, the white rhino has now received Near Threatened status as its total population tops out at 20,000 members. Poaching of the animal has gone virtually unchecked in most of Africa, and the non-violent nature of the rhinoceros makes it susceptible to poaching. Mozambique, one of the four main countries the white rhino occupies, is used by poachers as a passageway to South Africa, which holds a fairly large number of white rhinos. Here, rhinos are regularly killed and their horns are smuggled out of the country.<ref name=netwerk24>{{cite news|last1=B\u00fcrger|first1=Vicus|title=Stropery: Koerier praat uit|url=https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Omgewing/Stropery-Koerier-praat-uit-20150327|accessdate=25 March 2018|agency=Netwerk24|date=28 March 2015}}</ref> As of 2014, Mozambique labels white rhino poaching as a misdemeanor.<ref name=WWF/><ref>Dell'Amore, Christine (17 January 2014).

The English word \"white\" is said to have been derived by mistranslation of the Dutch word \"wijd\", which means \"wide\" in English. The word \"wide\" refers to the width of the rhinoceros's mouth. So early English-speaking settlers in South Africa misinterpreted the \"wijd\" for \"white\" and the rhino with the wide mouth ended up being called the white rhino and the other one, with the narrow pointed mouth, was called the [[black rhinoceros]]. Ironically, Dutch (and Afrikaans) later used a [[calque]] of the English word, and now also call it a ''white'' rhino. This suggests the origin of the word was before codification by Dutch writers. A review of Dutch and Afrikaans literature about the rhinoceros has failed to produce any evidence that the word ''wijd'' was ever used to describe the rhino outside of oral use.<ref name=\"White rhino name\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=refs&CODE=ref_detail&id=1165243803|journal=Pachyderm|author=Rookmaaker, Kees|title=Why the name of the white rhinoceros is not appropriate|volume=34|pages=88\u201393|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative name for the white rhinoceros, more accurate but rarely used, is the square-lipped rhinoceros.

[[Herbivore]] [[Grazing (behaviour)|grazers]] that eat grass, preferring the shortest grains, the white rhinoceros is one of the largest pure grazers. It drinks twice a day if water is available, but if conditions are dry it can live four or five days without water. It spends about half of the day eating, one third resting, and the rest of the day doing various other things. White rhinoceroses, like all species of rhinoceros, love wallowing in mud holes to cool down. The white rhinoceros is thought to have changed the structure and ecology of the savanna's grasslands. Comparatively based on studies of the African elephant, scientists believe the white rhino is a driving factor in its ecosystem. The destruction of the megaherbivore could have serious cascading effects on the ecosystem and harm other animals.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12218|title=Restoration of a megaherbivore: Landscape-level impacts of white rhinoceros in Kruger National Park, South Africa|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=102|issue=3|pages=566\u2013575|year=2014|last1=Cromsigt|first1=J.

The white rhino is particularly vulnerable to hunting, because it is a large and relatively unaggressive animal with very poor eye sight and generally occurs in herds.\n\nDespite the lack of scientific evidence, the rhino horn is highly prized in traditional Asian medicine, where it is ground into a fine powder or manufactured into tablets to be used as a treatment for a variety of illnesses such as nosebleeds, strokes, convulsions, and fevers. Due to this demand, several highly organized and very profitable international poaching syndicates came into being and would carry out their poaching missions with advanced technologies ranging from night vision scopes, silenced weapons, darting equipment and even helicopters. The ongoing civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and incursions by poachers primarily coming from Sudan have further disrupted efforts to protect the few remaining northern rhinos.<ref name=WWF>{{cite web|url= http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/rhinoceros/african_rhinos/poaching_crisis_african_rhinos/|title=African rhino poaching crisis |publisher=[[World Wide Fund For Nature|WWF]]|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, poaching rates for white rhinos nearly doubled from the previous year. As a result, the white rhino has now received Near Threatened status as its total population tops out at 20,000 members. Poaching of the animal has gone virtually unchecked in most of Africa, and the non-violent nature of the rhinoceros makes it susceptible to poaching. Mozambique, one of the four main countries the white rhino occupies, is used by poachers as a passageway to South Africa, which holds a fairly large number of white rhinos. Here, rhinos are regularly killed and their horns are smuggled out of the country.<ref name=netwerk24>{{cite news|last1=B\u00fcrger|first1=Vicus|title=Stropery: Koerier praat uit|url=https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Omgewing/Stropery-Koerier-praat-uit-20150327|accessdate=25 March 2018|agency=Netwerk24|date=28 March 2015}}</ref> As of 2014, Mozambique labels white rhino poaching as a misdemeanor.<ref name=WWF/><ref>Dell'Amore, Christine (17 January 2014).

They placed the male rhino in an enclosure with both female northern white rhinos in hopes to cross-breed the subspecies.
