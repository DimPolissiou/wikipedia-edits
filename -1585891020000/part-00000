|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> \nThe medical workers are concerned that the shortages have not been addressed by the CDC, whose changing guidance for healthcare over how to stay safe themselves and protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \n\"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.

|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> \nThe medical workers are concerned that the shortages have not been addressed by the CDC, whose changing guidance for healthcare over how to stay safe themselves and protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\nMid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the [[N95 mask]]s. The [[American Nurses Association]] sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern \n\"that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" and \"that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"<ref name=\"nyt-ppe-shortage\" />\n\n===Hospitals and ventilators===\nIn 2020, hospitals in California hired rental ventilators and rationed N95 masks, raising complaints from nurses.
