IcyFive claimed that he did not stream snipe Blevins and uploaded a video as proof. DrLupo later stated that he did not believe IcyFive stream sniped Blevins, mentioning that using an emote was a regular reaction to an increase in spectator count after an elimination, and also stated that he did not condone Blevins' actions, comparing them to a rant. Blevins later apologized to IcyFive on [[Twitter]] but also accused the player of \"playing the victim\" and \"milking\" the incident, calling him \"naive\" for assuming players would be banned solely on his word.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/11/12/fortnite-ninja-reports-player-for-stream-sniping-apologizes/&psig=AOvVaw0hxilpUX26WcrV1HZQldF3&ust=1543672550396225 |title=Ninja Reports 'Fortnite' Player for Stream Sniping and Later Apologizes |work=WWG |access-date=November 30, 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005114/https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/11/12/fortnite-ninja-reports-player-for-stream-sniping-apologizes/%26psig%3DAOvVaw0hxilpUX26WcrV1HZQldF3%26ust%3D1543672550396225 |archive-date=December 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/ninja-apologizes-after-falsely-rage-reporting-a-fortnite-player-for-stream-sniping-216460 |title=Ninja apologizes after falsely rage reporting a Fortnite player for stream sniping |last=Genova |first=Vincent |website=Dexerto |access-date=December 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221000722/https://www.dexerto.com/fortnite/ninja-apologizes-after-falsely-rage-reporting-a-fortnite-player-for-stream-sniping-216460 |archive-date=December 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Film roles\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Qismati and Nasibi", "text_new": "''Qismati and Nasibi''  is a short story written by Egyption author [[Naguib Mahfouz]] and included in the short story collection ''I Saw, in a Dream'', published in 1982.  It was included in a collection of short stories written in Arabic ''Modern Arabic Short Stories: A Bilingual Reader,'' edited/translated into English by Ronak Husni and Daniel Newman. The title in Arabic means \"My Fate and My Destiny.\"\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe story opens with a presentation of Mohsen Khalil, a spice seller. Despite his good fortune and many prayers, this man and his wife Sitt Anabaya have been unable to conceive. At the age of forty, Sitt discovers that she is pregnant. She gives birth to conjoined twins, a child with one body and two chests and heads. The parents are distraught but resigned to this fate. They name one child Qismati and the other one Nasibi, though they are registered on the birth certificate as one child. Each develops a distinct physical aspect: Qismati has a dark complexion with hazel eyes while Nasibi is fair with black eyes. Nasibi is naughty and destructive; he enjoys chasing chickens and torturing cats. Qismati is submissive and quietly religious.\n\nSocialization for the child difficult because the situation is so unusual. The neighbors are curious but cautious and the parents have to bribe them to get their children to play with Nasibi and Qismati. Amourous affection for a young girl named Samiha provoks aggression and jealousy in the twins, and then a black eye and a bloody lip. Schooling must be done in the home, where Qismati proves an able and engaged student while Nasibi is uninterested and has little talent for learning. Nasibi does all he can to undermine his brother's efforts. Even fasting becomes an issue because when Qismati wants to fast, Nasibi eats and fills their shared abdomen.\n\nAs they grow older, the boys become more different in their character and demeanor, and increasingly dislike each other. This creates a terrible and unsolvable dilemma since they cannot seperate from each other. Qismati enjoys reading and learning; Nasibi preferes to run outside and annoy the neighbors. These differences cause countless fights and the parents grow increasingly wearied by the constant conflict. Despite the counseling of their father to find compromise and harmony, the boys cannot resolve their differences and refuse to love each other. They are provided a wife and a job working in their father's shop, but these benefits do nothing to allay the twins' dispair. They blame each other and their parents for the misfortune of their birth. Nasibi becomes more and more miserable, aging prematurely as his health declines. Finally he dies, leaving Qismati in the strange position of carrying his brother's dead corpse around to live a half-life, half-death. Unable to adjust, Qismati too dies shortly afterward.\n\n== Style ==\nThe genre of the tale is neither comedic nor tragic; instead it is a kind of \"tragic comedy\" according to the translator/editor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124025907|title=Modern Arabic short stories : a bilingual reader|others=Husni, Ronak., Newman, Daniel L.|isbn=978-0-86356-436-9|location=London|oclc=124025907}}</ref> It is widely regarded as an allegory with multiple interpretations.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is akin to the process he followed in other works, the novel ''Children of Our Alley'', for example.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Johnson-Davies|first=Denys|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/30/culture.obituaries|title=Naguib Mahfouz|date=2006-08-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The range of possibilities for interpretation are not always palatable to the author, however.

Notable additional characters include [[quotation mark|curly quotation marks]] and all the printable characters that are in [[ISO/IEC 8859-15|ISO&nbsp;8859-15]] (at different places than ISO&nbsp;8859-15). It is known to Windows by the [[Windows code page|code page]] number 1252, and by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]-approved name \"windows-1252\".\n\n<!-- I think the following text is right but I need to do some checking first before I uncomment it (not quite true, yes it happened, but Netscape, Mosaic, et al. were at fault as well :)\nAt one stage many MS internet products produced text in Windows-1252 but marked as ISO-8859-1. This has resulted in other internet applications treating ISO-8859-1 as meaning Windows-1252 to maintain compatibility with Microsoft products.\nFollowing text is copied (mostly) from ISO-8859-1 page.\n-->It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behavior in the [[HTML5 in mobile devices|HTML5]] specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding.<ref name=\"WHATWG\">{{cite web |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |title=Encoding |at=sec. 5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archivedate=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><!-- No authors listed on page, but GitHub lists contributors as -->\n\nHistorically, the phrase \"ANSI Code Page\" was used in Windows to refer to non-DOS encodings; the intention was that most of these would be [[ANSI]] standards such as [[ISO-8859-1]].

Notable additional characters include [[quotation mark|curly quotation marks]] and all the printable characters that are in [[ISO/IEC 8859-15|ISO&nbsp;8859-15]] (at different places than ISO&nbsp;8859-15).

This has resulted in other internet applications treating ISO-8859-1 as meaning Windows-1252 to maintain compatibility with Microsoft products.\nFollowing text is copied (mostly) from ISO-8859-1 page.\n-->It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling.
