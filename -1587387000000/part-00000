Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In one episode, Rita sent the brainwashed [[Tommy Oliver|Green Ranger]] to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a compact disc into Alpha's inner workings, unleashing a virus which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuity and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a [[force field]], but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon's instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the \"Singing Squash\" to undo a spell placed on [[Kimberly Hart|Kimberly]] and [[Billy Cranston|Billy]]. he encountered Rita's Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash.\n\nIn the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd's forces. In ''The Wannabe Ranger'', he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self-destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and [[Goldar]], but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in ''The Wedding'', he was ambushed by [[Villains in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers#Finster|Finster]] and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha's circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha's personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.\n\nIn the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda constellation]] by [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Supporting|King Lexian]], the grandfather of the [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Main|Masked Rider]]. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.\n\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nAlpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Zeo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nAlpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'', as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the '''Power Chamber'''. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the [[Power Rangers Zeo]]) as they battled the Machine Empire.<ref name=\"Dorama\"/> A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Turbo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Turbo}}\nWhen Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in ''Shift Into Turbo''), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in ''[[List of Power Rangers Turbo episodes|Passing of the Torch]]'', in which [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], [[Adam Park|Adam]], [[Katherine Hillard|Kat]], and [[Tanya Sloan|Tanya]] retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the ''Power Rangers'' series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode \"The Robot Ranger\". \n\n==Reception==\nAlpha 5 is noted as a \"beloved\" and \"lovable\" comic relief character of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise by various sources.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> \n\n==In other media==\n===Movies===\n====''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\nPeta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''.

The app was cross-platform, enabling app users to chat with Alpha 5 on either Facebook Messenger, Kik, or Twitter in the role of a potential Power Ranger candidate, and receive exclusive content for the film as reward for the interaction.  \n\nThe film's iteration of Alpha 5 has a bio-mechanical look that uses darker hues of the original design's red and blue colors, with a pair of eye stalks dangling from the saucer-shaped head as opposed to a visor.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Like his original TV series iteration, Alpha 5 is an android aide of Zordon; however, Alpha 5 has a less convivial relationship with the teenagers and is skeptical of their competence as the new Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Look\"/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> \n\nAlpha 5's drastically different design from the original iteration received a mixed response, with some journalists labeling it \"weird\",<ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"SC\"/> \"horrifying\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> or \"nightmarish\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> The ''[[LA Times]]'' and ''[[International Business Times]]'' both reported on strong disapproval from series fans in response to the reveal of Alpha 5's redesign.<ref name=LATimes/> <ref name=IBT/> Phillip Martinez dissented and thought that the redesign, though jarring, matched the visual language of the film's Power Rangers iteration.<ref name=\"Player\"/>\n\nThe decision to cast Hader as Alpha 5 was mostly well received by journalists.<ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/><ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Jacob Stolworthy from ''The Independent'' considered the casting as \"odd\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> Joshua Rivera from [[GQ Magazine]] expressed his concerns about the film's creation direction, and wondered if Hader would adopt Alpha 5's \"classic high-pitched fretting\", Alpha 6's \"weirdly nasal [[Long Island]] stylings\", or if he would approach the role as the \"latest Stefon joint\".<ref name=GQ/> Andy Webster, in a review of the 2017 film for the ''New York Times'', commented that \"Hader's dialed-down take\" of the character \"reflects the movie's tempered refinement of the original\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n===''Alpha's Magical Christmas''===\nAlpha 5 is the main character of ''Alpha's Magical Christmas'', a [[direct-to-video]] musical [[List of Christmas television specials|Christmas special]] produced during Season 2 of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''. The Rangers are away at the [[North Pole]] assisting [[Santa Claus]] in preparation for the Christmas holidays, while Alpha remains with Zordon for Christmas at the Command Center. Despite Zordon's presence, Alpha feels miserable from his loneliness. Zordon cheers Alpha up by presenting a [[Christmas tree]] to him, then follows that up by teleporting a group of children to the Command Center to sing Christmas carols with Alpha. Together they sing such carols as \"[[Good King Wenceslas]]\", \"[[Deck the Halls]]\", \"[[Here We Come A-Wassailing|Here We Come A-Caroling]]\", \"[[Jingle Bells]]\" and \"[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]\". After the children leave via the \"magical portal\", Tommy, Kimberly and Billy teleport to the Command Center in their ranger suits, and the cast perform \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" to end the special. \n\n===Comics===\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n==Promotion and merchandise==\nLike

Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image (giving him hair and glasses) before shutting Zordon off and up completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.\n\nIn the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]) by [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Supporting|King Lexian]], the grandfather of the [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Main|Masked Rider]]. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.\n\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nAlpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's predecessor who became obsolete and was replaced. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Zeo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nAlpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'', as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the '''Power Chamber'''. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the [[Power Rangers Zeo]]) as they battled the Machine Empire.<ref name=\"Dorama\"/> A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Turbo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Turbo}}\nWhen Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in ''Shift Into Turbo''), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in ''[[List of Power Rangers Turbo episodes|Passing of the Torch]]'', in which [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], [[Adam Park|Adam]], [[Katherine Hillard|Kat]], and [[Tanya Sloan|Tanya]] retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the ''Power Rangers'' series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode \"The Robot Ranger\". \n\n==Reception==\nAlpha 5 is noted as a \"beloved\" and \"lovable\" comic relief character of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise by various sources.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> \n\n==In other media==\n===Movies===\n====''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\nPeta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''. Like the film's other character costumes, the Alpha 5 suit Rixon donned was specifically designed for the movie.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n====''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie''====\n{{main|Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie}}\nIn ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', Alpha gains a new, streamlined body. His plating appears to be more reflective, and his lightning bolt was now an arrow pointing straight down. \n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n{{main|Power Rangers (2017 film)}}\n[[File:Alpha52017.png|left|upright|thumb|Concept art of Alpha 5, released as a preview to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\nIn the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character portrayed by [[Bill Hader]].<ref name=EW/> Hader acted out Alpha 5's movements in a motion-capture suit, and provides the voiced dialogue for the character in the recording booth.<ref name=Looper/> To promote the film, Lionsgate launched a \"chat bot\" app, which features a completely personalized, spontaneous chat with Alpha 5. The app was cross-platform, enabling app users to chat with Alpha 5 on either Facebook Messenger, Kik, or Twitter in the role of a potential Power Ranger candidate, and receive exclusive content for the film as reward for the interaction.  \n\nThe film's iteration of Alpha 5 has a bio-mechanical look that uses darker hues of the original design's red and blue colors, with a pair of eye stalks dangling from the saucer-shaped head as opposed to a visor.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Like his original TV series iteration, Alpha 5 is an android aide of Zordon; however, Alpha 5 has a less convivial relationship with the teenagers and is skeptical of their competence as the new Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Look\"/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> \n\nAlpha 5's drastically different design from the original iteration received a mixed response, with some journalists labeling it \"weird\",<ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"SC\"/> \"horrifying\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> or \"nightmarish\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> The ''[[LA Times]]'' and ''[[International Business Times]]'' both reported on strong disapproval from series fans in response to the reveal of Alpha 5's redesign.<ref name=LATimes/> <ref name=IBT/> Phillip Martinez dissented and thought that the redesign, though jarring, matched the visual language of the film's Power Rangers iteration.<ref name=\"Player\"/>\n\nThe decision to cast Hader as Alpha 5 was mostly well received by journalists.<ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/><ref name=\"Slash\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Jacob Stolworthy from ''The Independent'' considered the casting as \"odd\".<ref name=\"Indie\"/> Joshua Rivera from [[GQ Magazine]] expressed his concerns about the film's creation direction, and wondered if Hader would adopt Alpha 5's \"classic high-pitched fretting\", Alpha 6's \"weirdly nasal [[Long Island]] stylings\", or if he would approach the role as the \"latest Stefon joint\".<ref name=GQ/> Andy Webster, in a review of the 2017 film for the ''New York Times'', commented that \"Hader's dialed-down take\" of the character \"reflects the movie's tempered refinement of the original\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n===''Alpha's Magical Christmas''===\nAlpha 5 is the main character of ''Alpha's Magical Christmas'', a [[direct-to-video]] musical [[List of Christmas television specials|Christmas special]] produced during Season 2 of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''. The Rangers are away at the [[North Pole]] assisting [[Santa Claus]] in preparation for the Christmas holidays, while Alpha remains with Zordon for Christmas at the Command Center. Despite Zordon's presence, Alpha feels miserable from his loneliness. Zordon cheers Alpha up by presenting a [[Christmas tree]] to him, then follows that up by teleporting a group of children to the Command Center to sing Christmas carols with Alpha. Together they sing such carols as \"[[Good King Wenceslas]]\", \"[[Deck the Halls]]\", \"[[Here We Come A-Wassailing|Here We Come A-Caroling]]\", \"[[Jingle Bells]]\" and \"[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]\". After the children leave via the \"magical portal\", Tommy, Kimberly and Billy teleport to the Command Center in their ranger suits, and the cast perform \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" to end the special. \n\n===Comics===\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n==Promotion and merchandise==\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise.

population citation|England}}</ref> The urban area population of 724,000 is the 8th-largest in the UK.<ref name=\"c4c\"/> The city borders [[North Somerset]] and [[South Gloucestershire]], with the cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Gloucester]] to the south-east and north-east, respectively. [[South Wales]] lies across the [[Severn estuary]].\n\n[[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s and [[Roman villa]]s were built near the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]] and [[River Avon (Bristol)|Avon]], and around the beginning of the 11th century, the settlement was known as Brycgstow ([[Old English]] \"the place at the bridge\"). Bristol received a [[royal charter]] in 1155 and was [[Historic counties of England|historically]] divided between [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Somerset]] until 1373 when it became a [[County corporate|county of itself]]. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities, after [[London]], in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] in the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nBristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 [[John Cabot]], a [[Venice|Venetian]], became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 [[William Weston (explorer)|William Weston]], a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the [[Bristol slave trade]], from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The [[Port of Bristol]] has since moved from [[Bristol Harbour]] in the city centre to the [[Severn Estuary]] at [[Avonmouth]] and [[Royal Portbury Dock]].\n\nBristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and [[aerospace]] industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the UK; the [[Bristol pound]], which is [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] to the [[Pound sterling]]. The city has two universities, the [[University of Bristol]] and the [[University of the West of England]], and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the [[Royal West of England Academy]], the [[Arnolfini]], [[Spike Island, Bristol|Spike Island]], [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] and the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]]. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road and rail, and to the world by sea and air: road, by the [[M5 motorway|M5]] and [[M4 motorway|M4]] (which connect to the city centre by the [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]] and [[M32 motorway|M32]]); rail, via [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] mainline rail stations; and [[Bristol Airport]].\n\nOne of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers [[Dorling Kindersley]] in their ''[[Eyewitness Books|Eyewitness]]'' series of travel guides. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the [[European Union|EU's]] [[European Green Capital Award]] in 2015.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Caer Odor'' (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the [[River Frome, Bristol|River Frome]] and [[Avon Gorge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Bristol |url=http://www.riveravontrail.org.uk/earlybristol.html |website=riveravontrail.org.uk |publisher=River Avon Interpretation Project |accessdate=21 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022085114/http://www.riveravontrail.org.uk/earlybristol.html |archivedate=22 October 2016 }}</ref> It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name ''Bricstow'' was a simple [[calque]] of the existing [[Common Brittonic|Celtic]] name, with ''Bric'' (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix ''Stow'' replacing Caer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/853680 |website=A Vision of Britain Through Time |title=Descriptive Gazetteer Entry for Bristol |publisher=University of Portsmouth |accessdate=21 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022084925/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/853680 |archivedate=22 October 2016 }}.

Dr. Shaw derived the name from the [[Common Brittonic|Celtic]] words ''bras'' (quick, rapid), or ''braos'' (a gap, chasm) and ''tuile'' (a stream). The poet [[Thomas Chatterton]] popularised a derivation from ''Brictricstow'' linking the town to [[Brictric]], a leading landholder in the area.

population citation|England}}</ref> The urban area population of 724,000 is the 8th-largest in the UK.<ref name=\"c4c\"/> The city borders [[North Somerset]] and [[South Gloucestershire]], with the cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Gloucester]] to the south-east and north-east, respectively. [[South Wales]] lies across the [[Severn estuary]].\n\n[[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s and [[Roman villa]]s were built near the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]] and [[River Avon (Bristol)|Avon]], and around the beginning of the 11th century, the settlement was known as Brycgstow ([[Old English]] \"the place at the bridge\"). Bristol received a [[royal charter]] in 1155 and was [[Historic counties of England|historically]] divided between [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Somerset]] until 1373 when it became a [[County corporate|county of itself]]. From the 13th to the 18th century, Bristol was among the top three English cities, after [[London]], in tax receipts. Bristol was surpassed by the rapid rise of [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] in the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nBristol was a starting place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 [[John Cabot]], a [[Venice|Venetian]], became the first European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 [[William Weston (explorer)|William Weston]], a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At the height of the [[Bristol slave trade]], from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The [[Port of Bristol]] has since moved from [[Bristol Harbour]] in the city centre to the [[Severn Estuary]] at [[Avonmouth]] and [[Royal Portbury Dock]].\n\nBristol's modern economy is built on the creative media, electronics and [[aerospace]] industries, and the city-centre docks have been redeveloped as centres of heritage and culture. The city has the largest circulating community currency in the UK; the [[Bristol pound]], which is [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] to the [[Pound sterling]]. The city has two universities, the [[University of Bristol]] and the [[University of the West of England]], and a variety of artistic and sporting organisations and venues including the [[Royal West of England Academy]], the [[Arnolfini]], [[Spike Island, Bristol|Spike Island]], [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] and the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium]]. It is connected to London and other major UK cities by road and rail, and to the world by sea and air: road, by the [[M5 motorway|M5]] and [[M4 motorway|M4]] (which connect to the city centre by the [[Portway, Bristol|Portway]] and [[M32 motorway|M32]]); rail, via [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] mainline rail stations; and [[Bristol Airport]].\n\nOne of the UK's most popular tourist destinations, Bristol was selected in 2009 as one of the world's top ten cities by international travel publishers [[Dorling Kindersley]] in their ''[[Eyewitness Books|Eyewitness]]'' series of travel guides. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' named it as the best city in Britain in which to live in 2014 and 2017, and Bristol also won the [[European Union|EU's]] [[European Green Capital Award]] in 2015.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe most ancient recorded name for Bristol is the archaic [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Caer Odor'' (the fort on the chasm), which is consistent with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the [[River Frome, Bristol|River Frome]] and [[Avon Gorge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Bristol |url=http://www.riveravontrail.org.uk/earlybristol.html |website=riveravontrail.org.uk |publisher=River Avon Interpretation Project |accessdate=21 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022085114/http://www.riveravontrail.org.uk/earlybristol.html |archivedate=22 October 2016 }}</ref> It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name ''Bricstow'' was a simple [[calque]] of the existing [[Common Brittonic|Celtic]] name, with ''Bric'' (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix ''Stow'' replacing Caer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/853680 |website=A Vision of Britain Through Time |title=Descriptive Gazetteer Entry for Bristol |publisher=University of Portsmouth |accessdate=21 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022084925/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/853680 |archivedate=22 October 2016 }}.  The modern Welsh name, taken from the English, is \"Bryste\".</ref> Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with [[Samuel Seyer]] enumerating 47 alternative forms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seyer |first1=Samuel |title=Memoirs, Historical and Topographical of Bristol and its Neighborhood |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirshistorica02seye |date=1823 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017080607/https://archive.org/details/memoirshistorica02seye |archivedate=17 October 2015 |publisher=Bristol, Printed for the author by J. M. Gutch }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old English]] form ''Brycgstow'' is commonly used to derive the meaning ''place at the bridge''.{{sfn|Little|1967|p=ix}} Utilizing another form, ''Brastuile'', Rev.

{"title_page": "Midrasha", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}\nA '''''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4}}, pl. ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study|Jewish studies]] for women. In [[Israel]], it is often an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. The term is often translated as '[[seminary]]'.{{fact|date=October 2014}} \n\nIn [[Israel]], a midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' (institute). Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}''  accept both men and women, such as the Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Eni Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term has also been used to refer to co-educational Jewish studies programs, allowing high school students to continue their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Ethics (Musar)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']].

''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study|Jewish studies]] for women. In [[Israel]], it is often an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. The term is often translated as '[[seminary]]'.{{fact|date=October 2014}} \n\nIn [[Israel]], a midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' (institute).
