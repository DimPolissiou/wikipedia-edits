At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power.

The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element within a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie.''  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. The most commonly accepted of these was [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the [[minimalist program]] under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the [[minimalist program]] is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Merge is the simplest form of recursive generation, which allows people to combine words into infinite strings. Under merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. Recent investigations of displacement concur to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated generative grammar. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Frankun Ramus and Simon Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible externalisation and interaction we engage in.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nStemming from the usage-based approach, the [[Competition Model]], developed by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], views language acquisition as consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon a linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues with the use of competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internal and external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie.''  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ====\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. The most commonly accepted of these was [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]]. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the minimalist program under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the [[minimalist program]] is [[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]. Merge is the simplest form of recursive generation. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. Under Merge there are two ways in which larger expressions can be constructed: externally and internally. Lexical items that are merged externally build argument representations with disjoint constituents. The internal merge creates constituent structures where one is a part of another. This induces [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], the capacity to pronounce phrases in one position, but interpret them elsewhere. Recent investigations of displacement point to a slight rewiring in cortical brain regions that could have occurred historically and perpetuated communication. Upkeeping this line of thought, in 2009, Frankun Ramus and Simon Fishers speculated that a single gene could create a signalling molecule to facilitate new brain connections or a new area of the brain altogether via prenatally defined brain regions. This would result in information processing greatly important to language, as we know it. The spread of this advantage trait could be responsible externalisation and interaction we engage in<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nFrom the side of [[biosemiotics]], the has been a recent claim that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language. This meaning-making consists internaland external cognitive processes. Thus, it holds that such process organisation could not have only given a rise to language alone. According to this perspective all living things possess these processes, regardless of how wide the variation, as a posed to species-specific.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

It was a member of the [[Protoceratopsidae]], a group of early horned dinosaurs. Unlike later ceratopsians, however, it was a much smaller creature that lacked well-developed horns and retained some basal traits not seen in later genera.\n\n''Protoceratops'' had a large neck frill which was likely used as a display site to impress other members of the species. Other hypotheses about its function include protection of the neck and anchoring of jaw muscles, but the fragility of the frill and the poor leverage offered by possible attachment sites here makes these ideas implausible. Described by [[Walter W. Granger]] and [[W.K. Gregory]] in 1923, ''Protoceratops'' was initially believed to be an ancestor of the North American ceratopsians. Researchers currently distinguish two species of ''Protoceratops'' (''P. andrewsi'' and ''P. hellenikorhinus''), based in part by their respective sizes.\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] discovered [[fossil]]ized [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in [[Mongolia]] that were interpreted as belonging to this dinosaur, but which turned out to be those of ''[[Oviraptor]]''.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Protoceratops scale.png|thumb|left|Size of ''P. andrewsi'' compared to a human]]\n''Protoceratops'' was a [[quadruped]]al dinosaur that was partially characterized by its distinctive [[neck frill]] at the back of its skull.

The frill consists mostly of the [[parietal bone|parietal]] bone and partially of the [[squamosal]]. Some researchers, including [[Peter Dodson]]<ref name=\"Dodson96\"/> attribute the different sizes and shapes of these bones to [[sexual dimorphism]], as well as the age of the specimen, at the time of death.\n\n''Protoceratops'' was approximately 1.8&nbsp;meters (5.9&nbsp;ft) in length and 0.6&nbsp;meters (2&nbsp;ft) high at the shoulder.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursprotoceratops\">\"Protoceratops.\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J.

It was a member of the [[Protoceratopsidae]], a group of early horned dinosaurs. Unlike later ceratopsians, however, it was a much smaller creature that lacked well-developed horns and retained some basal traits not seen in later genera.\n\n''Protoceratops'' had a large neck frill which was likely used as a display site to impress other members of the species. Other hypotheses about its function include protection of the neck and anchoring of jaw muscles, but the fragility of the frill and the poor leverage offered by possible attachment sites here makes these ideas implausible. Described by [[Walter W. Granger]] and [[W.K. Gregory]] in 1923, ''Protoceratops'' was initially believed to be an ancestor of the North American ceratopsians. Researchers currently distinguish two species of ''Protoceratops'' (''P. andrewsi'' and ''P. hellenikorhinus''), based in part by their respective sizes.\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] discovered [[fossil]]ized [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in [[Mongolia]] that were interpreted as belonging to this dinosaur, but which turned out to be those of ''[[Oviraptor]]''.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Protoceratops scale.png|thumb|left|Size of ''P. andrewsi'' compared to a human]]\n''Protoceratops'' was a [[quadruped]]al dinosaur that was partially characterized by its distinctive [[neck frill]] at the back of its skull.

The frill consists mostly of the [[parietal bone|parietal]] bone and partially of the [[squamosal]]. Some researchers, including [[Peter Dodson]]<ref name=\"Dodson96\"/> attribute the different sizes and shapes of these bones to [[sexual dimorphism]], as well as the age of the specimen, at the time of death.\n\n''Protoceratops'' was approximately 1.8&nbsp;meters (5.9&nbsp;ft) in length and 0.6&nbsp;meters (2&nbsp;ft) high at the shoulder.<ref name=\"ageofdinosaursprotoceratops\">\"Protoceratops.\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J.

Griffins were described as lion-sized quadrupeds with large claws and a raptor-bird-like beak; they laid their eggs in nests on the ground.<!-- ref for entire paragraph above --><ref>{{cite book|author=Mayor, A.|year=2000|title=The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times|publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-05863-4}}</ref>\n\nGreek writers began describing the griffin around 675 B.C., at the same time the Greeks first made contact with Scythian nomads.

{"title_page": "Politics of the United States", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}\n{{Politics of the United States}}\n\nThe '''United States''' is an [[oligarchy]] whilst claiming to be a federal [[constitutional republic]], in which the [[President of the United States]] (the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]), [[United States Congress|Congress]], and [[United States federal courts|judiciary]] share [[Separation of powers|powers]] reserved to the national government, and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] shares [[sovereignty]] with the [[U.S. state|state]] governments.\n\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is headed by the President and is independent of the legislature. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, exercises [[Judiciary|judicial power]] (or judiciary). The judiciary's function is to interpret the [[United States Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution. Two [[political party|political parties]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], have dominated American politics since the [[American Civil War]], although [[List of political parties in the United States|other parties]] have also existed.\n\nThere are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed [[democracy|democracies]]. These include increased power of the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the [[separation of powers]] between the legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main parties. The United States is one of the world's developed democracies where third parties have the least political influence.\n\nThe federal entity created by the U.S. Constitution is the dominant feature of the American governmental system. However, most people are also subject to a [[U.S. state|state]] government, and all are subject to various units of local government. The latter include counties, municipalities, and special districts.\n\nThis multiplicity of jurisdictions reflects the country's history. The federal government was created by the states, which as [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to efficiently carry out various state functions. As the country expanded, it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.\n\n==State government==\n[[State governments of the United States|States governments]] have the power to make laws on all subjects that are not granted to the federal government or denied to the states in the [[U.S. Constitution]].These include [[education]], [[family law]], [[contract law]], and most [[crime]]s. Unlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution.\n\nLike the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected [[Governor (United States)|governor]], who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except for [[Nebraska]], which has [[Unicameral|unicameral legislature]], all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the [[Senate]] and the lower house called the [[House of Representatives]], the [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] or something similar. In most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year terms.\n\nThe constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government. However, state constitutions are generally more detailed.\n\n==Local government==\n{{see also|Urban politics in the United States}}\nThere are 89,500 local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492 municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000 other special districts that deal with issues like fire protection.<ref>''Statistical Abstract: 2010'' p. 416.</ref> Local governments directly serve the needs of the people, providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation, and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan--local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.<ref>Ann O'M. Bowman and Richard C. Kearney, ''State and Local Government: The Essentials'' (2008) p. 78</ref>\n\nAbout 28% of the people live in cities of 100,000 or more population. City governments are chartered by states, and their charters detail the objectives and powers of the [[municipal government]]. For most big cities, cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to meeting the needs of their residents.  Types of city governments vary widely across the nation. However, almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city's affairs.  Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics.\n\nThere are three general types of city government: the [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council]], the commission, and the [[Council-manager government|council-manager]]. These are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.\n\n==== Mayor-Council ====\nThis is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials, sometimes with the approval of the council. He or she has the power of veto over ordinances (the laws of the city) and often is responsible for preparing the city's budget. The council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.\n\n==== The Commission ====\nThis combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected city-wide. Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments. Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although his or her power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners.<ref>http://www.talgov.com/commission</ref>\n\n==== Council-Manager ====\nThe city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager.\n\nThe city    manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities. Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with his or her work.\n\n===County government===\nThe [[county (United States)|county]] is a subdivision of the state, sometimes (but not always) containing two or more [[township (United States)|township]]s and several villages. New York City is so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs, each a county in its own right. On the other hand, [[Arlington County, Virginia]], the United States' smallest county, located just across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], is both an urbanized and suburban area, governed by a unitary county administration. In other cities, both the city and county governments have merged, creating a [[consolidated city\u2013county]] government.\n\nIn most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the [[county seat]], and this is where the government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a [[sole commissioner]], who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections. In some [[New England]] states, counties do not have any governmental function and are simply a division of land.\n\n=== Town and village government ===\nThousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city governments. These are chartered as towns and villages and deal with local needs such as paving and lighting the streets, ensuring a water supply, providing police and fire protection, and waste management. In many states of the US, the term ''town'' does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how [[civil township]]s are used in other states.\n\nThe government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council, which may be known by a variety of names: town or village council, board of selectmen, board of supervisors, board of commissioners. The board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief executive officer, or there may be an elected mayor. Governmental employees may include a clerk, treasurer, police and fire officers, and health and welfare officers.\n\nOne unique aspect of local government, found mostly in the [[New England]] region of the United States, is the [[town meeting]]. Once a year, sometimes more often if needed, the registered voters of the town meet in open session to elect officers, debate local issues, and pass laws for operating the government. As a body, they decide on road construction and repair, construction of public buildings and facilities, tax rates, and the town budget. The town meeting, which has existed for more than three centuries in some places, is often cited as the purest form of [[direct democracy]], in which the governmental power is not delegated, but is exercised directly and regularly by all the people.\n\n=== Suffrage ===\n{{Main|Voting rights in the United States}}\n[[Suffrage]] is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older. All states and the [[District of Columbia]] contribute to the electoral vote for President. However, the District, and other U.S. holdings like [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]], lack representation in Congress. These constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas. Each commonwealth, territory, or district can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives.\n\nVoting rights are sometimes restricted as a result of felony conviction, but such laws vary widely by state. Election of the president is an indirect suffrage: voters vote for electors who comprise the [[United States Electoral College]] and who, in turn vote for President. These presidential electors were originally expected to exercise their own judgement. In modern practice, though, they are expected to vote as pledged and some [[faithless electors]] have not.\n\n==Campaign finance==\n{{Main|Campaign finance in the United States}}\n\nSuccessful participation, especially in federal elections, requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertising.<ref>http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml</ref> This money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base,<ref>http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/sep/28/recession-means-theres-less-money-campaigns/</ref> although in the 2008 election, candidates from both parties had success with raising money from citizens over the Internet.,<ref>http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2008/July/20080710130812mlenuhret0.6269953.html</ref> as had [[Howard Dean]] with his Internet appeals. Both parties generally depend on wealthy donors and organizations - traditionally the Democrats depended on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on business donations{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. Since 1984, however, the Democrats' business donations have surpassed those from labor organizations{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. This dependency on donors is controversial, and has led to laws limiting spending on political campaigns being enacted (see [[campaign finance reform]]). Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] or [[Canada]].\n\n==Political culture==\n===Colonial origins===\n{{main|Colonial history of the United States|Thirteen Colonies}}\nThe American political culture is deeply rooted in the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial experience]] and the [[American Revolution]]. The colonies were exceptional in the European world for their vibrant political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) p 281</ref>  First, suffrage was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote.  While fewer than 1% of British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible. While the roots of democracy were apparent, nevertheless deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.<ref>Richard R. Beeman, \"The Varieties of Deference in Eighteenth-Century America,\" ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Volume 3#2 Fall 2005, pp. 311-340</ref> That deference declined sharply with the [[American Revolution]].  Second, in each colony a wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) pp 281-2</ref> Topic of public concern and debate included land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools. Americans spent a great deal of time in court, as private lawsuits were very common. Legal affairs were overseen by local judges and juries, with a central role for trained lawyers. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, and dominant role of lawyers in politics was apparent by the 1770s, as attested by the careers of [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], among many others.<ref>Anton-Hermann Chroust, ''The Rise of the legal profession in America'' (2 vol 1965), vol 1.</ref> Thirdly, the American colonies were exceptional in world context because of the growth of representation of different interest groups.  Unlike Europe, where the  royal court, aristocratic families and the established church were in control, the American political culture was open to merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable groups.  Over 90% of the representatives elected to the legislature lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have a member of Parliament and absentee member of Parliament.  Finally, and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.<ref>Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', pp 281-286</ref> None of the colonies had political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power.\n\n===American ideology===\n[[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], along with a form of [[classical liberalism]] remains the dominant ideology. Central documents include the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), the ''Federalist Papers'' (1788), the Bill of Rights (1791), and Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Address\" (1863), among others. Among the core tenets of this ideology are the following:\n* [[Civic duty]]: citizens have the responsibility to understand and support the government, participate in elections, pay taxes, and perform military service.\n* Opposition to [[Political corruption]].\n* [[Democracy]]: The government is answerable to citizens, who may change the representatives through elections.\n* [[Equality before the law]]: The laws should attach no special privilege to any citizen. Government officials are subject to the law just as others are.\n* [[Freedom of religion]]: The government can neither support nor suppress religion.\n* [[Freedom of speech]]: The government cannot restrict through law or action the personal, non-violent speech of a citizen; a [[marketplace of ideas]].\n\nAt the time of the United States' founding, the economy was predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses, and state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative. As in the UK and other industrialized countries, laissez-faire ideology was largely discredited during the Great Depression. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus, a time during which [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] dominated economic policy virtually unchallenged.<ref name=\"Weeks\">Weeks, J.

The country abandoned this policy when it became a [[superpower]], and the country mostly supports [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].\n\n==Political parties and elections==\nThe [[United States Constitution]] has never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president.  Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation.<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers, including Hamilton and Madison.\n\nIn partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independent. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot.  Typically, major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties in the United States}}\n\nThe modern political party system in the United States is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] since at least 1856. Several other [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] from time to time achieve relatively minor representation at the national and state levels.\n\nAmong the two major parties, the Democratic Party generally positions itself as [[Left-wing politics|left-of-center]] in American politics and supports an [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]] platform, while the Republican Party generally positions itself as [[Right-wing politics|right-of-center]] and supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] platform.\n\n===Elections===\n{{details|Elections in the United States}}\n\nUnlike the [[United Kingdom]] and other similar [[parliamentary system]]s, Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party. With a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levels. On a national level, the [[President of the United States|President]], is elected indirectly by the people, through an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. In modern times, the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the offices at the state and local levels are directly elected.\n\nBoth federal and state laws regulate elections. The [[United States Constitution]] defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] and various [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]]. [[U.S. state|State]] law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.\n\n===Organization of American political parties===<!-- This section is linked from [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] -->\n{{See also|Political party strength in U.S. states}}\n\nAmerican political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries. The two major parties, in particular, have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership, activities, or policy positions, though some state affiliates do. Thus, for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or Republican party, is quite different from a Briton's stating that he or she is a member of the Conservative or Labour party. In the United States, one can often become a \"member\" of a party, merely by stating that fact. In some U.S. states, a voter can register as a member of one or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another party. Such participation does not restrict one's choices in any way. It also does not give a person any particular rights or obligations within the party, other than possibly allowing that person to vote in that party's primary elections. A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next day. The sole factor that brings one \"closer to the action\" is the quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility.\n\nParty identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, and it is often difficult to tell who is going to do the voting.\n\nThe result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. A party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that person. Once in office, an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent.\n\nAt the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (See, [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Republican National Committee]]) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and affiliated organizations, and others important to the party. However, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party.\n\nBoth parties also have separate campaign committees which work to elect candidates at a specific level. The most significant of these are the [[Hill committee]]s, which work to elect candidates to each house of Congress.\n\nState parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and the state level.\n\nDespite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties. In what is known as \"[[Coattail effect|presidential coattails]]\", candidates in presidential elections become the ''de facto'' leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. On the other hand, federal [[midterm election]]s (where only Congress and not the president is up for election) are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's performance, with voters either voting in or out the president's party's candidates, which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president's agenda, respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/07/AR2006110701697.html | title=A Voter Rebuke For Bush, the War And the Right | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=2006-11-08 | quote=Bush and senior adviser Karl Rove tried to replicate that strategy this fall, hoping to keep the election from becoming a referendum on the president's leadership. | first1=Peter | last1=Baker | first2=Jim | last2=VandeHei | accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|  url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/04/impeachment/ | title=Election '98 Lewinsky factor never materialized| publisher=[[CNN]] | date=1998-11-04 | quote=Americans shunned the opportunity to turn Tuesday's midterm elections into a referendum on President Bill Clinton's behavior, dashing Republican hopes of gaining seats in the House and Senate.}}</ref>\n\n==Political pressure groups==\n{{see also|Advocacy group}}\nSpecial [[Advocacy group|interest groups]] advocate the cause of their specific constituency. Business organizations will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions of the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargaining. Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their organizations or their beliefs.\n\nOne type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the [[political action committee]] or PAC. These are independent groups, organized around a [[single issue]] or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] or the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions, however, on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office. PACs today number in the thousands.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies,\" says [[Michael Schudson]] in his 1998 book ''The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life''. \"Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens' dollars, time, and passion.\"\n\nThe amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow, as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans have the feeling that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences.\n\nA survey of members of the American Economic Association find the vast majority regardless of political affiliation to be discontent with the current state of democracy in America.  The primary concern relates to the prevalence and influence of special interest groups within the political process, which tends to lead to policy consequences that only benefit such special interest groups and politicians.  Some conjecture that maintenance of the policy status quo and hesitance to stray from it perpetuates a political environment that fails to advance society's welfare.<ref>Davis, William L., and Bob Figgins. 2009.

[http://econjwatch.org/articles/do-economists-believe-american-democracy-is-working Econjwatch.org]</ref>\n\n===General developments===\n{{See also|History of the United States Republican Party|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\n\nMany of America's [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] hated the thought of political parties.<ref>http://www.shmoop.com/political-parties/founding-fathers-political-parties.html</ref> They were sure quarreling factions would be more interested in contending with each other than in working for the common good. They wanted citizens to vote for candidates without the interference of organized groups, but this was not to be.\n\nBy the 1790s, different views of the new country's proper course had already developed, and those who held these opposing views tried to win support for their cause by banding together. The followers of [[Alexander Hamilton]], the Hamiltonian faction, took up the name \"[[Federalist Party|Federalist]]\"; they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industry. The followers of [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Jeffersonians and then the \"Anti-Federalists,\" took up the name \"[[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]\"; they preferred a decentralized [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] republic in which the federal government had limited power. By 1828, the Federalists had disappeared as an organization, replaced by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], brought to life in opposition to the election that year of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. Jackson's presidency split the Democratic-Republican Party: Jacksonians became the Democratic Party and those following the leadership of [[John Quincy Adams]] became the \"National Republicans.\" The two-party system, still in existence today, was born. (Note: The National Republicans of John Quincy Adams is not the same party as today's Republican Party.)\n\nIn the 1850s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country's new territories in the West. The Whig Party straddled the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852 presidential election]]. Ex-Whigs joined the [[Know Nothing]]s or the newly formed Republican Party. While the Know Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil War. The primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territories. Just six years later, this new party captured the presidency when [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the election of 1860. By then, parties were well established as the country's dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had become an important part of most people's consciousness. Party loyalty was passed from fathers to sons, and party activities, including spectacular campaign events, complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many communities.\n\nBy the 1920s, however, this boisterous folksiness had diminished. Municipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions had all helped to clean up politics.\n\n===Development of the two-party system in the United States===\n{{Ref improve section|date=October 2008}}\n{{See also|Two-party system#Causes of a two-party system|l1=Causes of a two-party system}}\n\nSince the 1790s, the country has been run by two major parties. Many minor or third political parties appear from time to time. They tend to serve a means to advocate policies that eventually are adopted by the two major political parties. At various times the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], the [[Farmer-Labor Party]] and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] for a few years had considerable local strength, and then faded away\u2014although in [[Minnesota]], the Farmer\u2013Labor Party merged into the state's Democratic Party, which is now officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]]. At present, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] is the most successful third party.  New York State has a number of additional third parties, who sometimes run their own candidates for office and sometimes nominate the nominees of the two main parties.  In the District of Columbia, the D.C. Statehood Party has served as a strong third party behind the Democratic Party and Republican Party.\n\nMost officials in America are elected from single-member districts and win office by beating out their opponents in a system for determining winners called ''[[First Past the Post electoral system|first-past-the-post]]''; the one who gets the [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] wins, (which is not the same thing as actually getting a [[majority]] of votes). This encourages the [[two-party system]]; see [[Duverger's law]]. In the absence of multi-seat congressional districts, proportional representation is impossible and third parties cannot thrive. Senators were originally selected by state legislatures, but have been elected by popular vote since 1913. Although elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency (state), staggered terms effectively result in single-seat constituencies for elections to the Senate.\n\nAnother critical factor has been [[ballot access]] law. Originally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported. Later on, this developed into a process whereby each political party would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party's ballot into the voting box. In the late nineteenth century, states began to adopt the [[secret ballot|Australian Secret Ballot Method]], and it eventually became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters) and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot. The fact that state legislatures were dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political parties, yet such laws did not start to arise until the [[first Red Scare]] that hit America after [[World War I]]. State legislatures began to enact tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition could legally be circulated.\n\nIt should also be noted that while more often than not, party members will \"toe the line\" and support their party's policies, they are free to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition (\"cross the aisle\") when they please.\n\n\"In America the same political labels (Democratic and Republican) cover virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties,\" says [[Nelson W. Polsby]], professor of political science, in the book ''New Federalist Papers: Essays in Defense of the Constitution''. \"Yet Democrats and Republicans are not everywhere the same. Variations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote, Democratic or Republican. These differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking something more like a hundred-party system.\"\n\n===Political spectrum of the two major parties===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\nDuring the 20th century, the overall political philosophy of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party underwent a dramatic shift from their earlier philosophies. From the 1860s to the 1950s the Republican Party was considered to be the more classically [[liberalism|liberal]] of the two major parties and the Democratic Party the more classically [[conservatism|conservative]]/[[Populism|populist]] of the two.\n\nThis changed a great deal with the presidency of Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], whose [[New Deal]] included the founding of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] as well as a variety of other federal services and public works projects. Roosevelt's performance in the twin crises of the Depression and [[World War II]] led to a sort of polarization in national politics, centered around him; this combined with his increasingly liberal policies to turn FDR's Democrats to the left and the Republican Party further to the right.\n\nDuring the 1950s and the early 1960s, both parties essentially expressed a more [[centrism|centrist]] approach to politics on the national level and had their liberal, [[moderate]], and conservative wings influential within both parties.\n\nFrom the early 1960s, the conservative wing became more dominant in the Republican Party, and the liberal wing became more dominant in the Democratic Party. [[United States presidential election, 1964|The 1964 presidential election]] heralded the rise of the conservative wing among Republicans. The liberal and conservative wings within the Democratic Party were competitive until 1972, when [[George McGovern]]'s candidacy marked the triumph of the liberal wing. This similarly happened in the Republican Party with the candidacy and later [[Landslide victory|landslide]] election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which marked the triumph of the conservative wing.\n\nBy the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], each major party had largely become identified by its dominant political orientation. Strong showings in the 1990s by reformist independent Ross Perot pushed the major parties to put forth more centrist presidential candidates, like [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]]. Polarization in Congress was said by some{{Who|date=February 2010}} to have been cemented by the Republican takeover of 1994. Others say that this polarization had existed since the late 1980s when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress.\n\nLiberals within the Republican Party and conservatives within the Democratic Party and the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] [[Neoliberalism|neoliberals]] have typically fulfilled the roles of so-called political mavericks, radical centrists, or brokers of compromise between the two major parties. They have also helped their respective parties gain in certain regions that might not ordinarily elect a member of that party; the Republican Party has used this approach with centrist Republicans such as [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[George Pataki]], [[Richard Riordan]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]] sent many centrist or conservative Democrats to state and federal legislatures including several, notably in Kansas and Montana, who switched parties.\n\n==Concerns about oligarchy and a diminishing democracy==\nSome views suggest that the political structure of the United States is in many respects an [[oligarchy]], where a small economic elite overwhelmingly determines policy and law.<ref>Sevcik, J.C.

Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of Congress, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The judicial branch (or judiciary), composed of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, exercises [[Judiciary|judicial power]] (or judiciary). The judiciary's function is to interpret the [[United States Constitution]] and [[Law of the United States|federal laws]] and regulations. This includes resolving disputes between the executive and legislative branches. The federal government's layout is explained in the Constitution. Two [[political party|political parties]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], have dominated American politics since the [[American Civil War]], although [[List of political parties in the United States|other parties]] have also existed.\n\nThere are major differences between the political system of the United States and that of most other developed [[democracy|democracies]]. These include increased power of the upper house of the legislature, a wider scope of power held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the [[separation of powers]] between the legislature and the executive, and the dominance of only two main parties. The United States is one of the world's developed democracies where third parties have the least political influence.\n\nThe federal entity created by the U.S. Constitution is the dominant feature of the American governmental system. However, most people are also subject to a [[U.S. state|state]] government, and all are subject to various units of local government. The latter include counties, municipalities, and special districts.\n\nThis multiplicity of jurisdictions reflects the country's history. The federal government was created by the states, which as [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] were established separately and governed themselves independently of the others. Units of local government were created by the colonies to efficiently carry out various state functions. As the country expanded, it admitted new states modeled on the existing ones.\n\n==State government==\n[[State governments of the United States|States governments]] have the power to make laws on all subjects that are not granted to the federal government or denied to the states in the [[U.S. Constitution]].These include [[education]], [[family law]], [[contract law]], and most [[crime]]s. Unlike the federal government, which only has those powers granted to it in the Constitution, a state government has inherent powers allowing it to act unless limited by a provision of the state or national constitution.\n\nLike the federal government, state governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The chief executive of a state is its popularly elected [[Governor (United States)|governor]], who typically holds office for a four-year term (although in some states the term is two years). Except for [[Nebraska]], which has [[Unicameral|unicameral legislature]], all states have a bicameral legislature, with the upper house usually called the [[Senate]] and the lower house called the [[House of Representatives]], the [[Deliberative assembly|Assembly]] or something similar. In most states, senators serve four-year terms, and members of the lower house serve two-year terms.\n\nThe constitutions of the various states differ in some details but generally follow a pattern similar to that of the federal Constitution, including a statement of the rights of the people and a plan for organizing the government. However, state constitutions are generally more detailed.\n\n==Local government==\n{{see also|Urban politics in the United States}}\nThere are 89,500 local governments, including 3,033 counties, 19,492 municipalities, 16,500 townships, 13,000 school districts, and 37,000 other special districts that deal with issues like fire protection.<ref>''Statistical Abstract: 2010'' p. 416.</ref> Local governments directly serve the needs of the people, providing everything from police and fire protection to sanitary codes, health regulations, education, public transportation, and housing. Typically local elections are nonpartisan--local activists suspend their party affiliations when campaigning and governing.<ref>Ann O'M. Bowman and Richard C. Kearney, ''State and Local Government: The Essentials'' (2008) p. 78</ref>\n\nAbout 28% of the people live in cities of 100,000 or more population. City governments are chartered by states, and their charters detail the objectives and powers of the [[municipal government]]. For most big cities, cooperation with both state and federal organizations is essential to meeting the needs of their residents.  Types of city governments vary widely across the nation. However, almost all have a central council, elected by the voters, and an executive officer, assisted by various department heads, to manage the city's affairs.  Cities in the West and South usually have nonpartisan local politics.\n\nThere are three general types of city government: the [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council]], the commission, and the [[Council-manager government|council-manager]]. These are the pure forms; many cities have developed a combination of two or three of them.\n\n==== Mayor-Council ====\nThis is the oldest form of city government in the United States and, until the beginning of the 20th century, was used by nearly all American cities. Its structure is like that of the state and national governments, with an elected mayor as chief of the executive branch and an elected council that represents the various neighborhoods forming the legislative branch. The mayor appoints heads of city departments and other officials, sometimes with the approval of the council. He or she has the power of veto over ordinances (the laws of the city) and often is responsible for preparing the city's budget. The council passes city ordinances, sets the tax rate on property, and apportions money among the various city departments. As cities have grown, council seats have usually come to represent more than a single neighborhood.\n\n==== The Commission ====\nThis combines both the legislative and executive functions in one group of officials, usually three or more in number, elected city-wide. Each commissioner supervises the work of one or more city departments. Commissioners also set policies and rules by which the city is operated. One is named chairperson of the body and is often called the mayor, although his or her power is equivalent to that of the other commissioners.<ref>http://www.talgov.com/commission</ref>\n\n==== Council-Manager ====\nThe city manager is a response to the increasing complexity of urban problems that need management ability not often possessed by elected public officials. The answer has been to entrust most of the executive powers, including law enforcement and provision of services, to a highly trained and experienced professional city manager.\n\nThe city    manager plan has been adopted by a large number of cities. Under this plan, a small, elected council makes the city ordinances and sets policy, but hires a paid administrator, also called a city manager, to carry out its decisions. The manager draws up the city budget and supervises most of the departments. Usually, there is no set term; the manager serves as long as the council is satisfied with his or her work.\n\n===County government===\nThe [[county (United States)|county]] is a subdivision of the state, sometimes (but not always) containing two or more [[township (United States)|township]]s and several villages. New York City is so large that it is divided into five separate boroughs, each a county in its own right. On the other hand, [[Arlington County, Virginia]], the United States' smallest county, located just across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], is both an urbanized and suburban area, governed by a unitary county administration. In other cities, both the city and county governments have merged, creating a [[consolidated city\u2013county]] government.\n\nIn most U.S. counties, one town or city is designated as the [[county seat]], and this is where the government offices are located and where the board of commissioners or supervisors meets. In small counties, boards are chosen by the county; in the larger ones, supervisors represent separate districts or townships. The board collects taxes for state and local governments; borrows and appropriates money; fixes the salaries of county employees; supervises elections; builds and maintains highways and bridges; and administers national, state, and county welfare programs. In very small counties, the executive and legislative power may lie entirely with a [[sole commissioner]], who is assisted by boards to supervise taxes and elections. In some [[New England]] states, counties do not have any governmental function and are simply a division of land.\n\n=== Town and village government ===\nThousands of municipal jurisdictions are too small to qualify as city governments. These are chartered as towns and villages and deal with local needs such as paving and lighting the streets, ensuring a water supply, providing police and fire protection, and waste management. In many states of the US, the term ''town'' does not have any specific meaning; it is simply an informal term applied to populated places (both incorporated and unincorporated municipalities). Moreover, in some states, the term town is equivalent to how [[civil township]]s are used in other states.\n\nThe government is usually entrusted to an elected board or council, which may be known by a variety of names: town or village council, board of selectmen, board of supervisors, board of commissioners. The board may have a chairperson or president who functions as chief executive officer, or there may be an elected mayor. Governmental employees may include a clerk, treasurer, police and fire officers, and health and welfare officers.\n\nOne unique aspect of local government, found mostly in the [[New England]] region of the United States, is the [[town meeting]]. Once a year, sometimes more often if needed, the registered voters of the town meet in open session to elect officers, debate local issues, and pass laws for operating the government. As a body, they decide on road construction and repair, construction of public buildings and facilities, tax rates, and the town budget. The town meeting, which has existed for more than three centuries in some places, is often cited as the purest form of [[direct democracy]], in which the governmental power is not delegated, but is exercised directly and regularly by all the people.\n\n=== Suffrage ===\n{{Main|Voting rights in the United States}}\n[[Suffrage]] is nearly universal for citizens 18 years of age and older. All states and the [[District of Columbia]] contribute to the electoral vote for President. However, the District, and other U.S. holdings like [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guam]], lack representation in Congress. These constituencies do not have the right to choose any political figure outside their respective areas. Each commonwealth, territory, or district can only elect a non-voting delegate to serve in the House of Representatives.\n\nVoting rights are sometimes restricted as a result of felony conviction, but such laws vary widely by state. Election of the president is an indirect suffrage: voters vote for electors who comprise the [[United States Electoral College]] and who, in turn vote for President. These presidential electors were originally expected to exercise their own judgement. In modern practice, though, they are expected to vote as pledged and some [[faithless electors]] have not.\n\n==Campaign finance==\n{{Main|Campaign finance in the United States}}\n\nSuccessful participation, especially in federal elections, requires large amounts of money, especially for television advertising.<ref>http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml</ref> This money is very difficult to raise by appeals to a mass base,<ref>http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/sep/28/recession-means-theres-less-money-campaigns/</ref> although in the 2008 election, candidates from both parties had success with raising money from citizens over the Internet.,<ref>http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2008/July/20080710130812mlenuhret0.6269953.html</ref> as had [[Howard Dean]] with his Internet appeals. Both parties generally depend on wealthy donors and organizations - traditionally the Democrats depended on donations from organized labor while the Republicans relied on business donations{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. Since 1984, however, the Democrats' business donations have surpassed those from labor organizations{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. This dependency on donors is controversial, and has led to laws limiting spending on political campaigns being enacted (see [[campaign finance reform]]). Opponents of campaign finance laws cite the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s guarantee of free speech, and challenge campaign finance laws because they attempt to circumvent the people's constitutionally guaranteed rights. Even when laws are upheld, the complication of compliance with the First Amendment requires careful and cautious drafting of legislation, leading to laws that are still fairly limited in scope, especially in comparison to those of other countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] or [[Canada]].\n\n==Political culture==\n===Colonial origins===\n{{main|Colonial history of the United States|Thirteen Colonies}}\nThe American political culture is deeply rooted in the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial experience]] and the [[American Revolution]]. The colonies were exceptional in the European world for their vibrant political culture, which attracted the most talented and ambitious young men into politics.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) p 281</ref>  First, suffrage was the most widespread in the world, with every man who owned a certain amount of property allowed to vote.  While fewer than 1% of British men could vote, a majority of white American men were eligible. While the roots of democracy were apparent, nevertheless deference was typically shown to social elites in colonial elections.<ref>Richard R. Beeman, \"The Varieties of Deference in Eighteenth-Century America,\" ''Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Volume 3#2 Fall 2005, pp. 311-340</ref> That deference declined sharply with the [[American Revolution]].  Second, in each colony a wide range of public and private business was decided by elected bodies, especially the assemblies and county governments.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''A Factious People: Politics and Society in Colonial New York'' (Columbia U.P., 1971) pp 281-2</ref> Topic of public concern and debate included land grants, commercial subsidies, and taxation, as well as oversight of roads, poor relief, taverns, and schools. Americans spent a great deal of time in court, as private lawsuits were very common. Legal affairs were overseen by local judges and juries, with a central role for trained lawyers. This promoted the rapid expansion of the legal profession, and dominant role of lawyers in politics was apparent by the 1770s, as attested by the careers of [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], among many others.<ref>Anton-Hermann Chroust, ''The Rise of the legal profession in America'' (2 vol 1965), vol 1.</ref> Thirdly, the American colonies were exceptional in world context because of the growth of representation of different interest groups.  Unlike Europe, where the  royal court, aristocratic families and the established church were in control, the American political culture was open to merchants, landlords, petty farmers, artisans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Quakers, Germans, Scotch Irish, Yankees, Yorkers, and many other identifiable groups.  Over 90% of the representatives elected to the legislature lived in their districts, unlike England where it was common to have a member of Parliament and absentee member of Parliament.  Finally, and most dramatically, the Americans were fascinated by and increasingly adopted the political values of [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], which stressed equal rights, the need for virtuous citizens, and the evils of corruption, luxury, and aristocracy.<ref>Bonomi, ''A Factious People'', pp 281-286</ref> None of the colonies had political parties of the sort that formed in the 1790s, but each had shifting factions that vied for power.\n\n===American ideology===\n[[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], along with a form of [[classical liberalism]] remains the dominant ideology. Central documents include the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), the ''Federalist Papers'' (1788), the Bill of Rights (1791), and Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Address\" (1863), among others. Among the core tenets of this ideology are the following:\n* [[Civic duty]]: citizens have the responsibility to understand and support the government, participate in elections, pay taxes, and perform military service.\n* Opposition to [[Political corruption]].\n* [[Democracy]]: The government is answerable to citizens, who may change the representatives through elections.\n* [[Equality before the law]]: The laws should attach no special privilege to any citizen. Government officials are subject to the law just as others are.\n* [[Freedom of religion]]: The government can neither support nor suppress religion.\n* [[Freedom of speech]]: The government cannot restrict through law or action the personal, non-violent speech of a citizen; a [[marketplace of ideas]].\n\nAt the time of the United States' founding, the economy was predominantly one of agriculture and small private businesses, and state governments left welfare issues to private or local initiative. As in the UK and other industrialized countries, laissez-faire ideology was largely discredited during the Great Depression. Between the 1930s and 1970s, fiscal policy was characterized by the Keynesian consensus, a time during which [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] dominated economic policy virtually unchallenged.<ref name=\"Weeks\">Weeks, J.

The country abandoned this policy when it became a [[superpower]], and the country mostly supports [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].\n\n==Political parties and elections==\nThe [[United States Constitution]] has never formally addressed the issue of political parties, primarily because the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president.  Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation.<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers, including Hamilton and Madison.\n\nIn partisan elections, candidates are nominated by a political party or seek public office as an independent. Each state has significant discretion in deciding how candidates are nominated, and thus eligible to appear on the election ballot.  Typically, major party candidates are formally chosen in a party primary or convention, whereas minor party and Independents are required to complete a petitioning process.\n\n===Political parties===\n{{Main|Political parties in the United States}}\n\nThe modern political party system in the United States is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] since at least 1856. Several other [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] from time to time achieve relatively minor representation at the national and state levels.\n\nAmong the two major parties, the Democratic Party generally positions itself as [[Left-wing politics|left-of-center]] in American politics and supports an [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]] platform, while the Republican Party generally positions itself as [[Right-wing politics|right-of-center]] and supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] platform.\n\n===Elections===\n{{details|Elections in the United States}}\n\nUnlike the [[United Kingdom]] and other similar [[parliamentary system]]s, Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party. With a federal government, officials are elected at the federal (national), state and local levels. On a national level, the [[President of the United States|President]], is elected indirectly by the people, through an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. In modern times, the electors virtually always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the offices at the state and local levels are directly elected.\n\nBoth federal and state laws regulate elections. The [[United States Constitution]] defines (to a basic extent) how federal elections are held, in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] and various [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]]. [[U.S. state|State]] law regulates most aspects of electoral law, including primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, and the running of state and local elections.\n\n===Organization of American political parties===<!-- This section is linked from [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] -->\n{{See also|Political party strength in U.S. states}}\n\nAmerican political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries. The two major parties, in particular, have no formal organization at the national level that controls membership, activities, or policy positions, though some state affiliates do. Thus, for an American to say that he or she is a member of the Democratic or Republican party, is quite different from a Briton's stating that he or she is a member of the Conservative or Labour party. In the United States, one can often become a \"member\" of a party, merely by stating that fact. In some U.S. states, a voter can register as a member of one or another party and/or vote in the primary election for one or another party. Such participation does not restrict one's choices in any way. It also does not give a person any particular rights or obligations within the party, other than possibly allowing that person to vote in that party's primary elections. A person may choose to attend meetings of one local party committee one day and another party committee the next day. The sole factor that brings one \"closer to the action\" is the quantity and quality of participation in party activities and the ability to persuade others in attendance to give one responsibility.\n\nParty identification becomes somewhat formalized when a person runs for partisan office. In most states, this means declaring oneself a candidate for the nomination of a particular party and intent to enter that party's primary election for an office. A party committee may choose to endorse one or another of those who is seeking the nomination, but in the end the choice is up to those who choose to vote in the primary, and it is often difficult to tell who is going to do the voting.\n\nThe result is that American political parties have weak central organizations and little central ideology, except by consensus. A party really cannot prevent a person who disagrees with the majority of positions of the party or actively works against the party's aims from claiming party membership, so long as the voters who choose to vote in the primary elections elect that person. Once in office, an elected official may change parties simply by declaring such intent.\n\nAt the federal level, each of the two major parties has a national committee (See, [[Democratic National Committee]], [[Republican National Committee]]) that acts as the hub for much fund-raising and campaign activities, particularly in presidential campaigns. The exact composition of these committees is different for each party, but they are made up primarily of representatives from state parties and affiliated organizations, and others important to the party. However, the national committees do not have the power to direct the activities of members of the party.\n\nBoth parties also have separate campaign committees which work to elect candidates at a specific level. The most significant of these are the [[Hill committee]]s, which work to elect candidates to each house of Congress.\n\nState parties exist in all fifty states, though their structures differ according to state law, as well as party rules at both the national and the state level.\n\nDespite these weak organizations, elections are still usually portrayed as national races between the political parties. In what is known as \"[[Coattail effect|presidential coattails]]\", candidates in presidential elections become the ''de facto'' leader of their respective party, and thus usually bring out supporters who in turn then vote for his party's candidates for other offices. On the other hand, federal [[midterm election]]s (where only Congress and not the president is up for election) are usually regarded as a referendum on the sitting president's performance, with voters either voting in or out the president's party's candidates, which in turn helps the next session of Congress to either pass or block the president's agenda, respectively.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/07/AR2006110701697.html | title=A Voter Rebuke For Bush, the War And the Right | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=2006-11-08 | quote=Bush and senior adviser Karl Rove tried to replicate that strategy this fall, hoping to keep the election from becoming a referendum on the president's leadership. | first1=Peter | last1=Baker | first2=Jim | last2=VandeHei | accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|  url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/04/impeachment/ | title=Election '98 Lewinsky factor never materialized| publisher=[[CNN]] | date=1998-11-04 | quote=Americans shunned the opportunity to turn Tuesday's midterm elections into a referendum on President Bill Clinton's behavior, dashing Republican hopes of gaining seats in the House and Senate.}}</ref>\n\n==Political pressure groups==\n{{see also|Advocacy group}}\nSpecial [[Advocacy group|interest groups]] advocate the cause of their specific constituency. Business organizations will favor low corporate taxes and restrictions of the right to strike, whereas labor unions will support minimum wage legislation and protection for collective bargaining. Other private interest groups, such as churches and ethnic groups, are more concerned about broader issues of policy that can affect their organizations or their beliefs.\n\nOne type of private interest group that has grown in number and influence in recent years is the [[political action committee]] or PAC. These are independent groups, organized around a [[single issue]] or set of issues, which contribute money to political campaigns for [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] or the [[President of the United States|presidency]]. PACs are limited in the amounts they can contribute directly to candidates in federal elections. There are no restrictions, however, on the amounts PACs can spend independently to advocate a point of view or to urge the election of candidates to office. PACs today number in the thousands.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The number of interest groups has mushroomed, with more and more of them operating offices in Washington, D.C., and representing themselves directly to Congress and federal agencies,\" says [[Michael Schudson]] in his 1998 book ''The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life''. \"Many organizations that keep an eye on Washington seek financial and moral support from ordinary citizens. Since many of them focus on a narrow set of concerns or even on a single issue, and often a single issue of enormous emotional weight, they compete with the parties for citizens' dollars, time, and passion.\"\n\nThe amount of money spent by these special interests continues to grow, as campaigns become increasingly expensive. Many Americans have the feeling that these wealthy interests, whether corporations, unions or PACs, are so powerful that ordinary citizens can do little to counteract their influences.\n\nA survey of members of the American Economic Association find the vast majority regardless of political affiliation to be discontent with the current state of democracy in America.  The primary concern relates to the prevalence and influence of special interest groups within the political process, which tends to lead to policy consequences that only benefit such special interest groups and politicians.  Some conjecture that maintenance of the policy status quo and hesitance to stray from it perpetuates a political environment that fails to advance society's welfare.<ref>Davis, William L., and Bob Figgins. 2009. Do Economists Believe American Democracy Is Working? ''[[Econ Journal Watch]]'' 6(2): 195-202.

They wanted citizens to vote for candidates without the interference of organized groups, but this was not to be.\n\nBy the 1790s, different views of the new country's proper course had already developed, and those who held these opposing views tried to win support for their cause by banding together. The followers of [[Alexander Hamilton]], the Hamiltonian faction, took up the name \"[[Federalist Party|Federalist]]\"; they favored a strong central government that would support the interests of commerce and industry. The followers of [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Jeffersonians and then the \"Anti-Federalists,\" took up the name \"[[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]\"; they preferred a decentralized [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] republic in which the federal government had limited power. By 1828, the Federalists had disappeared as an organization, replaced by the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], brought to life in opposition to the election that year of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. Jackson's presidency split the Democratic-Republican Party: Jacksonians became the Democratic Party and those following the leadership of [[John Quincy Adams]] became the \"National Republicans.\" The two-party system, still in existence today, was born. (Note: The National Republicans of John Quincy Adams is not the same party as today's Republican Party.)\n\nIn the 1850s, the issue of slavery took center stage, with disagreement in particular over the question of whether slavery should be permitted in the country's new territories in the West. The Whig Party straddled the issue and sank to its death after the overwhelming electoral defeat by Franklin Pierce in the [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852 presidential election]]. Ex-Whigs joined the [[Know Nothing]]s or the newly formed Republican Party. While the Know Nothing party was short-lived, Republicans would survive the intense politics leading up to the Civil War. The primary Republican policy was that slavery be excluded from all the territories. Just six years later, this new party captured the presidency when [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the election of 1860. By then, parties were well established as the country's dominant political organizations, and party allegiance had become an important part of most people's consciousness. Party loyalty was passed from fathers to sons, and party activities, including spectacular campaign events, complete with uniformed marching groups and torchlight parades, were a part of the social life of many communities.\n\nBy the 1920s, however, this boisterous folksiness had diminished. Municipal reforms, civil service reform, corrupt practices acts, and presidential primaries to replace the power of politicians at national conventions had all helped to clean up politics.\n\n===Development of the two-party system in the United States===\n{{Ref improve section|date=October 2008}}\n{{See also|Two-party system#Causes of a two-party system|l1=Causes of a two-party system}}\n\nSince the 1790s, the country has been run by two major parties. Many minor or third political parties appear from time to time. They tend to serve a means to advocate policies that eventually are adopted by the two major political parties. At various times the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], the [[Farmer-Labor Party]] and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] for a few years had considerable local strength, and then faded away\u2014although in [[Minnesota]], the Farmer\u2013Labor Party merged into the state's Democratic Party, which is now officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party|Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]]. At present, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] is the most successful third party.  New York State has a number of additional third parties, who sometimes run their own candidates for office and sometimes nominate the nominees of the two main parties.  In the District of Columbia, the D.C. Statehood Party has served as a strong third party behind the Democratic Party and Republican Party.\n\nMost officials in America are elected from single-member districts and win office by beating out their opponents in a system for determining winners called ''[[First Past the Post electoral system|first-past-the-post]]''; the one who gets the [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] wins, (which is not the same thing as actually getting a [[majority]] of votes). This encourages the [[two-party system]]; see [[Duverger's law]]. In the absence of multi-seat congressional districts, proportional representation is impossible and third parties cannot thrive. Senators were originally selected by state legislatures, but have been elected by popular vote since 1913. Although elections to the Senate elect two senators per constituency (state), staggered terms effectively result in single-seat constituencies for elections to the Senate.\n\nAnother critical factor has been [[ballot access]] law. Originally, voters went to the polls and publicly stated which candidate they supported. Later on, this developed into a process whereby each political party would create its own ballot and thus the voter would put the party's ballot into the voting box. In the late nineteenth century, states began to adopt the [[secret ballot|Australian Secret Ballot Method]], and it eventually became the national standard. The secret ballot method ensured that the privacy of voters would be protected (hence government jobs could no longer be awarded to loyal voters) and each state would be responsible for creating one official ballot. The fact that state legislatures were dominated by Democrats and Republicans provided these parties an opportunity to pass discriminatory laws against minor political parties, yet such laws did not start to arise until the [[first Red Scare]] that hit America after [[World War I]]. State legislatures began to enact tough laws that made it harder for minor political parties to run candidates for office by requiring a high number of petition signatures from citizens and decreasing the length of time that such a petition could legally be circulated.\n\nIt should also be noted that while more often than not, party members will \"toe the line\" and support their party's policies, they are free to vote against their own party and vote with the opposition (\"cross the aisle\") when they please.\n\n\"In America the same political labels (Democratic and Republican) cover virtually all public officeholders, and therefore most voters are everywhere mobilized in the name of these two parties,\" says [[Nelson W. Polsby]], professor of political science, in the book ''New Federalist Papers: Essays in Defense of the Constitution''. \"Yet Democrats and Republicans are not everywhere the same. Variations (sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant) in the 50 political cultures of the states yield considerable differences overall in what it means to be, or to vote, Democratic or Republican. These differences suggest that one may be justified in referring to the American two-party system as masking something more like a hundred-party system.\"\n\n===Political spectrum of the two major parties===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\nDuring the 20th century, the overall political philosophy of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party underwent a dramatic shift from their earlier philosophies. From the 1860s to the 1950s the Republican Party was considered to be the more classically [[liberalism|liberal]] of the two major parties and the Democratic Party the more classically [[conservatism|conservative]]/[[Populism|populist]] of the two.\n\nThis changed a great deal with the presidency of Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], whose [[New Deal]] included the founding of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] as well as a variety of other federal services and public works projects. Roosevelt's performance in the twin crises of the Depression and [[World War II]] led to a sort of polarization in national politics, centered around him; this combined with his increasingly liberal policies to turn FDR's Democrats to the left and the Republican Party further to the right.\n\nDuring the 1950s and the early 1960s, both parties essentially expressed a more [[centrism|centrist]] approach to politics on the national level and had their liberal, [[moderate]], and conservative wings influential within both parties.\n\nFrom the early 1960s, the conservative wing became more dominant in the Republican Party, and the liberal wing became more dominant in the Democratic Party. [[United States presidential election, 1964|The 1964 presidential election]] heralded the rise of the conservative wing among Republicans. The liberal and conservative wings within the Democratic Party were competitive until 1972, when [[George McGovern]]'s candidacy marked the triumph of the liberal wing. This similarly happened in the Republican Party with the candidacy and later [[Landslide victory|landslide]] election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980, which marked the triumph of the conservative wing.\n\nBy the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], each major party had largely become identified by its dominant political orientation. Strong showings in the 1990s by reformist independent Ross Perot pushed the major parties to put forth more centrist presidential candidates, like [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]]. Polarization in Congress was said by some{{Who|date=February 2010}} to have been cemented by the Republican takeover of 1994. Others say that this polarization had existed since the late 1980s when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress.\n\nLiberals within the Republican Party and conservatives within the Democratic Party and the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] [[Neoliberalism|neoliberals]] have typically fulfilled the roles of so-called political mavericks, radical centrists, or brokers of compromise between the two major parties. They have also helped their respective parties gain in certain regions that might not ordinarily elect a member of that party; the Republican Party has used this approach with centrist Republicans such as [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[George Pataki]], [[Richard Riordan]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]] sent many centrist or conservative Democrats to state and federal legislatures including several, notably in Kansas and Montana, who switched parties.\n\n==Concerns about oligarchy and a diminishing democracy==\nSome views suggest that the political structure of the United States is in many respects an [[oligarchy]], where a small economic elite overwhelmingly determines policy and law.<ref>Sevcik, J.C.

He wants a son and marries Menaka, who gives birth to Yuvraj. Suryakant abandons his daughters and spoils Yuvraj, who grows up insolent and arrogant.\n\nMenaka wishes to have sole rights to the household and wants to get the daughters married as soon as possible. She arranges Bhavishya Kapadia, an abusive man, to marry Saraswati. Her lover Kshitij saves her when her husband tries to set her alive, and after a long trial, the sisters win the case. Saraswati becomes pregnant after Bhavishya is imprisoned, and then marries Kshitij.\n\nThe youngest, lively Lakshmi is to wed Satyakam, who also helps find clues against Kapadia, but he dies, leaving her in a state of shock. She later meets Karan, who has come to the Gadodias to avenge his mother, who was actually harassed by Menaka's brother. He then marries Lakshmi, and in the end,  finds out she is pregnant.\n\nYuvraj is trapped by a prostitute Kajri, who he disguises as a traditional woman Pavitra, and marries. He is greedy and rebukes his mother.

Suryakant abandons his daughters and spoils Yuvraj, who grows up insolent and arrogant.\n\nMenaka wishes to have sole rights to the household and wants to get the daughters married as soon as possible. She arranges Bhavishya Kapadia, an abusive man, to marry Saraswati. Her lover Kshitij saves her when her husband tries to set her alive, and after a long trial, the sisters win the case. Saraswati becomes pregnant after Bhavishya is imprisoned, and then marries Kshitij.\n\nThe youngest, lively Lakshmi is to wed Satyakam, who also helps find clues against Kapadia, but he dies, leaving her in a state of shock.

In 1891, the [[Bengal Assam Railway]] was constructed with the assistance of the government. It was later run by the Bengal Assam Railway Company.\n\nOn 1 July 1895, two sections of metre gauge railway were constructed by English railway companies.
