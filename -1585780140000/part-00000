{"title_page": "History of Brazilian nationality", "text_new": "Located in South America, Brazil is the fifth largest and fifth most populous nation in the world. First discovered by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] on April 22, 1500, it remained a Portuguese colony until it declared its independence on September 7, 1822.\n\n==Brazilian nationality prior to independence==\nBrazil's economy was largely based on agriculture and mining; specifically the production of sugar and tobacco for export.  As a result, land was concentrated in the hands of relatively few wealthy, plantation-owning families, and production was largely dependent on slave labor.  The intermixing of these Europeans and Blacks, as well as the native Indians of the territory, helped create a unique people and culture.<ref>Burns,6</ref>\n\nThe social, economic, and political hierarchy of this period was largely based on race; with Europeans occupying the upper ranks and the non-whites subsequent ranks below them.  Despite these internal divisions, Brazil possessed a number of factors that aided in the formation of nationalist sentiments among the elite.\n\n\"[...]First its unity of territory. Brazil stretches unbroken from the Amazon in the north to the Rio de la Plata in the south, and from the Atlantic coast to the foothills of the Andes[...] The vast majority of the people speak Portuguese and are Roman Catholic.  Their language differentiates them from their Spanish speaking neighbors[...]\" <ref>Burns, 5</ref>\n\nA growing nationalistic trend in literature,<ref>Burns, 9</ref> and the emergence of colonial born elites created a sense of pride and attachment to the territory of Brazil and a distancing from Portugal. The revolutions in [[American Revolution|America]], [[French Revolution|France]], and the [[Spanish America]] along with the maturation of Brazil as a colony furthered nationalist sentiments.<ref>Burns, 25</ref>\n\n===Role of the Napoleonic Wars in Brazilian independence===\nDespite its natural geographic barriers and the distinct culture of its inhabitants, Brazilian independence would only be realized after a series of events set in motion by the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1807, Portugal was invaded by [[Napoleon]] forcing prince regent Dom Joao to flee to Brazil along with other members of the royal family, and a number of notables and functionaries. This effectively making Brazil the seat of the Portuguese government.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\">''Britannica'', 80</ref>\n\nWhile in Brazil, Dom Joao instituted a number of reforms and decrees, most notably the one on December 16, 1815, which designated the Portuguese dominions the \"United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves\", making Brazil coequal with Portugal.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\"/>\n\nAfter the French withdrawal from Portugal, mounting pressure from the Cortes (Portuguese parliament) forced the return of Dom Joao (now King John VI) in 1821. He appointed his son, Dom Pedro, regent in his place. Looking to return Brazil to its formerly dependent colonial status, the Cortes repealed many of the decrees and reforms of King John VI, and demanded Dom Pedro's return to Europe.\n\nDefying the Cortes, Dom Pedro formed a legislative and constituent assembly on June 3, 1822, and declared Brazil's independence on September 7, 1822. He was crowned Brazil's first emperor on December 1.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\"/>\n\n===Recognition of Brazil as a nation===\n*The United States recognized Brazil as a new nation in 1824.  Portugal followed a year later.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\"/>\n*In 1827, a treaty between Brazil and Britain was signed.  By signing the treaty Brazil agreed to abolish the slave trade within three years, and grant Britain a favored position in its markets in return for Britain's recognition of its independence.<ref>Burns, 35</ref>\n\n==Evolutions==\n\n===Government===\nSince its independence Brazil has been subject to a lot of internal unrest resulting in several years of military rule and the promulgation of several different constitutions, the most recent one being passed in 1988.  While political change has been frequent, the social and economic realities in Brazil have remained largely the same.\n\n\"Throughout modern Brazilian history every change of political regime-from the establishment of an independent empire in the early 1820s to the establishment of a modern representative democracy in the late 1980s- has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of the Brazilian elites to defend the status quo and their own interests by controlling, co-opting and, if necessary, repressing the forces in favor of radical social change[...]\",<ref name=\"Bethell\">Bethell</ref>\n\nWhile political and military developments in Europe helped lead to Brazilian independence, it was also partially a result of the Brazilian elites.  The plantation owners backed Pedro's declaration of independence because it granted them greater freedom to conduct trade and the opportunity to expand their overseas markets.  The emerging urban elite saw, who occupied an insecure position between plantation owners and slaves saw it as a way to improve their status.<ref>Burns, 30</ref>  Once agreed upon, independence was secured quickly and peacefully, with no concessions being made to the underprivileged groups in society.  \"The transition from colony to independent empire was characterized by political, economic, and social continuity.\" <ref>Leslie Bethell</ref>\n\nSubsequent governments and constitutions were also largely the result of elite initiatives.\n\n===Political incorporation and suffrage===\n\n====Imperial Constitution====\nUnder the Imperial Constitution, power was concentrated in the hands of the hereditary emperor who had the power to appoint ministers, counselers of state, provincial presidents, and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies was elected by a small segment of the population.  Though the government was only responsible to it in a limited extent.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\nDespite this, political participation of this period was surprisingly high.  Men who were twenty-five years old (twenty-one if married), Catholic, born free, with quite low annual income had the right to vote in the elections of the Chamber of Deputies.  These elections were however indirect.  They elected ''eleitores'', who were required to have a higher annual income, further restricting electoral participation.  And only the ''eleitores'' had the right to vote on the deputies.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\nThe initial rates of high political participation were eventually restricted in the latter parts of the nineteenth century. A gradual shift from slave to free labor, made abolition seem inevitable.  This created a growing fear among  both rural and urban elites that emancipated slaves would acquire the property necessary to secure the right to vote.\n\nTo quell this fear, the ''Savaria Law'' was passed in 1881.  Under this law the Chamber of Deputies would be directly elected, the voting age was lowered to twenty-one, and the property/income qualification to vote was removed.  It also allowed non-Catholics and former slaves to become eligible voters.  Most importantly, it required people to pass a literacy test in order to gain the right to vote.\n\nRather than extend political participation, the literacy tests greatly restricted it because eighty to eighty-five percent of the population at this time was illiterate.  Therefore, this literacy requirement counteracted the other democratic advances of the ''Savaria Law''.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\n=====Abolition of slavery=====\nThe Constitution of the Empire and subsequent laws all failed to deem slaves as citizens.  Instead, slaves were still \"excluded from the political community, from exercise of any political right, from all participation in national sovereignty of public authority.\" <ref name=\"Chalhoub, 76\">Chalhoub, 76</ref>  However, the Constitution did allow ''libertos''(freed slaves) to vote in elections, provided that they met the property income requirements.<ref name=\"Chalhoub, 76\"/>\n\nDespite its promise to Britain to abolish the slave trade within three years of its 1827 treaty, Brazil continued to import slaves up until the 1850s.<ref>Skidmore, 13</ref>  It was only after economic and political conditions permitted, that government initiatives were undertaken to abolish the slavery\n\nNovember 1866: immersed in the [[Paraguayan War]] and anxious to recruit troops, an Imperial Government decree permits slaves to serve in the [[Brazilian army]], and in return would be granted their freedom unconditionally.<ref>Skidmore, 15</ref>\n\nIn 1871, the Law of the Free Womb was passed, which declared that all children subsequently born to slave mothers would be free.  A loop hole allowed the master to refuse the government indemnity payment offered for the child at age 8, and thus, retain the child until 21.<ref>Chalhoub, 81</ref>  The children of slaves who were freed at the age of eight were turned over to the Imperial government and entitled to learn how to read and write in government institutions or through private tutors. However, the masters who opted to retain the children had no obligation to educate them.  This had the effect of excluding them from formal political participation, after their freedom, because of their illiteracy.<ref>Chalhoub, 82</ref>\n\nIn 1885, the Sexagenarian Law was passed.  This unconditionally freed slaves over sixty.<ref name=\"Skidmore, 38\">Skidmore, 38</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1888, [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], acting in place of her ailing father [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], signed the law that abolished slavery in Brazil, granting no compensation to slave owners.  This freed 700,000 slaves.<ref name=\"Skidmore, 38\"/>\n\n====Republican constitution====\nThe entire executive branch (president, state governor, and municipal prefeito) as well as the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, state assemblies and municipal councils were all elected.  However, fraud, intimidation, violence and the exercise of patronage by local landowners and agents of the grown was widespread. The presidential elections of this period were predetermined by state governors, and state elections were dominated by the Republican parties.  Despite this, and the limitations remaining of suffrage, the early years of the Republic did allow for a substantial advance in direct popular participation in comparison with the late empire.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\n====From Vargas to the military coup====\nThe revolution of 1930 effectively ended the Old Republic, and brought [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] to power.  He undertook a policy which sought to increase political incorporation within Brazil.  Rather than focus on extending political and economic rights, Vargas focused on the expansion of social rights in an attempt to control the process of economic growth and modernization.<ref name=\"Reis\">Reis</ref>\n\nA 1931 electoral law lowered the voting age to eighteen and granted woman the right to vote, making Brazil the second country in Americas to do so.  By 1933, the first woman had been elected to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe 1934 Social Charter in the Constitution guaranteed social rights to certain occupations, while neglecting rural labor and certain urban occupations.  This resulted in a hierarchy of citizenship categories based on occupational prestige, defined along the lines of unequal welfare benefits.<ref name=\"Mitchell and Wood\">Mitchell and Wood</ref>\n\nThe social rights guaranteed in this charter were closely tied to the urban labor market.  In order to be entitled to health assistance, retirement funds and other welfare benefits it required one to be entered in a formal job contract. This form of regulated citizenship emerged from the government's need to control the process of economic growth and modernization. By granting these social rights the government increasingly drew people into the urban labor market, allowing for economic expansion and development.<ref name=\"Reis\"/> As a result, the state, under Vargas took the lead in promoting nation-building and industrial growth in Brazil.\n\nAfter a 1945 electoral law was passed, men and women who were formally employed were automatically registered to vote.  This was an attempt to expand political participation among the urban working class, while still largely neglected the rural population.  The same year voting is also made mandatory.\n\nThe Constitution of 1946 still restricted political participation on the basis of literacy, disenfranchising more than half of the population as a result.\n\nAn act of Congress in 1950 restored individual responsibility over voter registration.  This restricted the political participation of urban workers, who had previously been automatically registered as a result of their employment.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\n====Military coup of 1964====\nOne of the key factors responsible for this military coup was the political mobilization of the rural lower classes. This threatened to undermine a tenet central to the government led  modernization, the exclusion of the lower rural classes from citizenship. As a result, the military took power, inaugurating twenty-one years of military dictatorship, which would be marked by further involvement of the state in economic development and political repression.<ref name=\"Reis\"/>\n\nTo extend political incorporation the regime tried to generalize access to social rights, first by unifying the welfare system, and also by partially extending social rights to rural laborers.  The continuous growth of the labor market helped incorporate people into the citizenship model based on social rights.\n\nThis increasing concentration of populations in urban centers created a strong demand on public goods and services, which was only exacerbated with the economic crisis of the 1980s.  Further adding to the situation, the growth of urban employment in the informal economy not only restricted access of social rights to this segment of the population, but weakened the tax basis for the welfare state.<ref name=\"Reis\"/>  Under these circumstances, the minority with secured jobs and access to social rights essentially became a privileged segment of the population. This only increased the political, social, and economic inequality that characterized Brazil.\n\n==Democracy==\n1985 saw the return of civilian rule following the election of president [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]].  Following his elections he passed a series of constitutional amendments which extended suffrage; most notably by removing the literacy requirement that restricted votership.  The municipal elections of 1985 were the first elections in Brazil based on universal suffrage.  The following years the elections of Congress and state governors were also based on universal suffrage. These developments represented an important step towards the institutionalization of democracy in Brazil.<ref name=\"Mitchell and Wood\"/>\n\n===Constitution of 1988===\nThe promulgation of a new constitution in 1988, marked the formal shift from a military dictatorship to a democracy in Brazil.<ref>Wheeler</ref>  It was followed in 1989 by the first direct presidential elections in thirty years, and the first presidential elections to be based upon universal suffrage.\n\nIt lifted official barriers to political participation and formally protected political rights.  Like the constitutions before it, it denies status privileges and reaffirms the inviolability of private property and equality of all citizens before the law. It also strengthened the ''Afonso Arinos Law.'' Originally passed in 1951, it sought to punish racial discrimination by redefining racist practice as a crime rather than just a misdemeanor.  Under the new constitution it went further, denying bail to those convicted of racial or colour prejudice, and stipulating prison sentences.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\nThe constitution also restricted the power of the military, bolstered individual rights, and implemented means to protect marginalized groups.\n\n==Racial inequality in Brazil==\nPoverty and inequality are persistent in Brazil, largely as a result the legacy of Portuguese colonialism and its dependence on slave labor. The social, economic and political development of Brazil only tended to increase inequality, primarily among the non-white population. \"[It is] clear that the darker a Brazilian, the more likely he [is] to be found at the bottom of the socio-economic scale by every indicator- income, occupation, education [...] subtle but unmistakable discrimination in social relations remain[...] although it has never been codified since the colonial era.\"<ref>Skidmore</ref>\n\nDespite the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in Brazil, there remains a discrepancy between formal principles of the state the actualities of democracy in practice.<ref>inequalities</ref>  The effects of skin color exemplify this fact, often perpetuating the inequalities that universal citizenship claimed to remove.  Within Brazil, a large proportion of the population still lack basic citizenship rights, such as access to education. As a result, new forms of citizenship are developing independent of state control, like the situation in the [[favelas]].\n\nThere is a growing social, political, economic and spatial exclusion of people living in informal urban settlements like favelas.<ref>Wheeler, 36</ref>  As the state withdraws from providing social services from these areas, family and social networks step in and fill the gap.  This caused a growing informalization of political activity among these groups, whereby these citizens identify their participation in the local community as the core feature of citizenship. They have moved them away from the national discourse of rights-based democratic practices as their definition of citizenship, towards one expressed through specific forms of community participation.<ref>Wheeler, 37</ref>\n\n===Indians===\nSince the time of European colonization, Indians have been marginalized spatially, politically, and economically.  During the colonial period, the policy towards Indians was to exterminate them or to contain them in church settlements.<ref>Allen, 149</ref> From the establishment of the republic on, the state has actively pursued a policy aimed at assimilating these native groups, and integrating them into Brazilian society.<ref>Allen, 151</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Brazil]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n<references/>\n\n===Notations===\n\n*Allen, Elizabeth. \"Brazil: Indians and the new Constitution\".

First discovered by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] on April 22, 1500, it remained a Portuguese colony until it declared its independence on September 7, 1822.\n\n==Brazilian nationality prior to independence==\nBrazil's economy was largely based on agriculture and mining; specifically the production of sugar and tobacco for export.  As a result, land was concentrated in the hands of relatively few wealthy, plantation-owning families, and production was largely dependent on slave labor.  The intermixing of these Europeans and Blacks, as well as the native Indians of the territory, helped create a unique people and culture.<ref>Burns,6</ref>\n\nThe social, economic, and political hierarchy of this period was largely based on race; with Europeans occupying the upper ranks and the non-whites subsequent ranks below them.  Despite these internal divisions, Brazil possessed a number of factors that aided in the formation of nationalist sentiments among the elite.\n\n\"[...]First its unity of territory. Brazil stretches unbroken from the Amazon in the north to the Rio de la Plata in the south, and from the Atlantic coast to the foothills of the Andes[...] The vast majority of the people speak Portuguese and are Roman Catholic.  Their language differentiates them from their Spanish speaking neighbors[...]\" <ref>Burns, 5</ref>\n\nA growing nationalistic trend in literature,<ref>Burns, 9</ref> and the emergence of colonial born elites created a sense of pride and attachment to the territory of Brazil and a distancing from Portugal. The revolutions in [[American Revolution|America]], [[French Revolution|France]], and the [[Spanish America]] along with the maturation of Brazil as a colony furthered nationalist sentiments.<ref>Burns, 25</ref>\n\n===Role of the Napoleonic Wars in Brazilian independence===\nDespite its natural geographic barriers and the distinct culture of its inhabitants, Brazilian independence would only be realized after a series of events set in motion by the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1807, Portugal was invaded by [[Napoleon]] forcing prince regent Dom Joao to flee to Brazil along with other members of the royal family, and a number of notables and functionaries. This effectively making Brazil the seat of the Portuguese government.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\">''Britannica'', 80</ref>\n\nWhile in Brazil, Dom Joao instituted a number of reforms and decrees, most notably the one on December 16, 1815, which designated the Portuguese dominions the \"United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves\", making Brazil coequal with Portugal.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\"/>\n\nAfter the French withdrawal from Portugal, mounting pressure from the Cortes (Portuguese parliament) forced the return of Dom Joao (now King John VI) in 1821. He appointed his son, Dom Pedro, regent in his place. Looking to return Brazil to its formerly dependent colonial status, the Cortes repealed many of the decrees and reforms of King John VI, and demanded Dom Pedro's return to Europe.\n\nDefying the Cortes, Dom Pedro formed a legislative and constituent assembly on June 3, 1822, and declared Brazil's independence on September 7, 1822. He was crowned Brazil's first emperor on December 1.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\"/>\n\n===Recognition of Brazil as a nation===\n*The United States recognized Brazil as a new nation in 1824.  Portugal followed a year later.<ref name=\"Britannica, 80\"/>\n*In 1827, a treaty between Brazil and Britain was signed.  By signing the treaty Brazil agreed to abolish the slave trade within three years, and grant Britain a favored position in its markets in return for Britain's recognition of its independence.<ref>Burns, 35</ref>\n\n==Evolutions==\n\n===Government===\nSince its independence Brazil has been subject to a lot of internal unrest resulting in several years of military rule and the promulgation of several different constitutions, the most recent one being passed in 1988.  While political change has been frequent, the social and economic realities in Brazil have remained largely the same.\n\n\"Throughout modern Brazilian history every change of political regime-from the establishment of an independent empire in the early 1820s to the establishment of a modern representative democracy in the late 1980s- has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of the Brazilian elites to defend the status quo and their own interests by controlling, co-opting and, if necessary, repressing the forces in favor of radical social change[...]\",<ref name=\"Bethell\">Bethell</ref>\n\nWhile political and military developments in Europe helped lead to Brazilian independence, it was also partially a result of the Brazilian elites.  The plantation owners backed Pedro's declaration of independence because it granted them greater freedom to conduct trade and the opportunity to expand their overseas markets.  The emerging urban elite saw, who occupied an insecure position between plantation owners and slaves saw it as a way to improve their status.<ref>Burns, 30</ref>  Once agreed upon, independence was secured quickly and peacefully, with no concessions being made to the underprivileged groups in society.  \"The transition from colony to independent empire was characterized by political, economic, and social continuity.\" <ref>Leslie Bethell</ref>\n\nSubsequent governments and constitutions were also largely the result of elite initiatives.\n\n===Political incorporation and suffrage===\n\n====Imperial Constitution====\nUnder the Imperial Constitution, power was concentrated in the hands of the hereditary emperor who had the power to appoint ministers, counselers of state, provincial presidents, and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies was elected by a small segment of the population.  Though the government was only responsible to it in a limited extent.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\nDespite this, political participation of this period was surprisingly high.  Men who were twenty-five years old (twenty-one if married), Catholic, born free, with quite low annual income had the right to vote in the elections of the Chamber of Deputies.  These elections were however indirect.  They elected ''eleitores'', who were required to have a higher annual income, further restricting electoral participation.  And only the ''eleitores'' had the right to vote on the deputies.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\nThe initial rates of high political participation were eventually restricted in the latter parts of the nineteenth century. A gradual shift from slave to free labor, made abolition seem inevitable.  This created a growing fear among  both rural and urban elites that emancipated slaves would acquire the property necessary to secure the right to vote.\n\nTo quell this fear, the ''Savaria Law'' was passed in 1881.  Under this law the Chamber of Deputies would be directly elected, the voting age was lowered to twenty-one, and the property/income qualification to vote was removed.  It also allowed non-Catholics and former slaves to become eligible voters.  Most importantly, it required people to pass a literacy test in order to gain the right to vote.\n\nRather than extend political participation, the literacy tests greatly restricted it because eighty to eighty-five percent of the population at this time was illiterate.  Therefore, this literacy requirement counteracted the other democratic advances of the ''Savaria Law''.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\n=====Abolition of slavery=====\nThe Constitution of the Empire and subsequent laws all failed to deem slaves as citizens.  Instead, slaves were still \"excluded from the political community, from exercise of any political right, from all participation in national sovereignty of public authority.\" <ref name=\"Chalhoub, 76\">Chalhoub, 76</ref>  However, the Constitution did allow ''libertos''(freed slaves) to vote in elections, provided that they met the property income requirements.<ref name=\"Chalhoub, 76\"/>\n\nDespite its promise to Britain to abolish the slave trade within three years of its 1827 treaty, Brazil continued to import slaves up until the 1850s.<ref>Skidmore, 13</ref>  It was only after economic and political conditions permitted, that government initiatives were undertaken to abolish the slavery\n\nNovember 1866: immersed in the [[Paraguayan War]] and anxious to recruit troops, an Imperial Government decree permits slaves to serve in the [[Brazilian army]], and in return would be granted their freedom unconditionally.<ref>Skidmore, 15</ref>\n\nIn 1871, the Law of the Free Womb was passed, which declared that all children subsequently born to slave mothers would be free.  A loop hole allowed the master to refuse the government indemnity payment offered for the child at age 8, and thus, retain the child until 21.<ref>Chalhoub, 81</ref>  The children of slaves who were freed at the age of eight were turned over to the Imperial government and entitled to learn how to read and write in government institutions or through private tutors. However, the masters who opted to retain the children had no obligation to educate them.  This had the effect of excluding them from formal political participation, after their freedom, because of their illiteracy.<ref>Chalhoub, 82</ref>\n\nIn 1885, the Sexagenarian Law was passed.  This unconditionally freed slaves over sixty.<ref name=\"Skidmore, 38\">Skidmore, 38</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1888, [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], acting in place of her ailing father [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], signed the law that abolished slavery in Brazil, granting no compensation to slave owners.  This freed 700,000 slaves.<ref name=\"Skidmore, 38\"/>\n\n====Republican constitution====\nThe entire executive branch (president, state governor, and municipal prefeito) as well as the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, state assemblies and municipal councils were all elected.  However, fraud, intimidation, violence and the exercise of patronage by local landowners and agents of the grown was widespread. The presidential elections of this period were predetermined by state governors, and state elections were dominated by the Republican parties.  Despite this, and the limitations remaining of suffrage, the early years of the Republic did allow for a substantial advance in direct popular participation in comparison with the late empire.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\n====From Vargas to the military coup====\nThe revolution of 1930 effectively ended the Old Republic, and brought [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] to power.  He undertook a policy which sought to increase political incorporation within Brazil.  Rather than focus on extending political and economic rights, Vargas focused on the expansion of social rights in an attempt to control the process of economic growth and modernization.<ref name=\"Reis\">Reis</ref>\n\nA 1931 electoral law lowered the voting age to eighteen and granted woman the right to vote, making Brazil the second country in Americas to do so.  By 1933, the first woman had been elected to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe 1934 Social Charter in the Constitution guaranteed social rights to certain occupations, while neglecting rural labor and certain urban occupations.  This resulted in a hierarchy of citizenship categories based on occupational prestige, defined along the lines of unequal welfare benefits.<ref name=\"Mitchell and Wood\">Mitchell and Wood</ref>\n\nThe social rights guaranteed in this charter were closely tied to the urban labor market.  In order to be entitled to health assistance, retirement funds and other welfare benefits it required one to be entered in a formal job contract. This form of regulated citizenship emerged from the government's need to control the process of economic growth and modernization. By granting these social rights the government increasingly drew people into the urban labor market, allowing for economic expansion and development.<ref name=\"Reis\"/> As a result, the state, under Vargas took the lead in promoting nation-building and industrial growth in Brazil.\n\nAfter a 1945 electoral law was passed, men and women who were formally employed were automatically registered to vote.  This was an attempt to expand political participation among the urban working class, while still largely neglected the rural population.  The same year voting is also made mandatory.\n\nThe Constitution of 1946 still restricted political participation on the basis of literacy, disenfranchising more than half of the population as a result.\n\nAn act of Congress in 1950 restored individual responsibility over voter registration.  This restricted the political participation of urban workers, who had previously been automatically registered as a result of their employment.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\n====Military coup of 1964====\nOne of the key factors responsible for this military coup was the political mobilization of the rural lower classes. This threatened to undermine a tenet central to the government led  modernization, the exclusion of the lower rural classes from citizenship. As a result, the military took power, inaugurating twenty-one years of military dictatorship, which would be marked by further involvement of the state in economic development and political repression.<ref name=\"Reis\"/>\n\nTo extend political incorporation the regime tried to generalize access to social rights, first by unifying the welfare system, and also by partially extending social rights to rural laborers.  The continuous growth of the labor market helped incorporate people into the citizenship model based on social rights.\n\nThis increasing concentration of populations in urban centers created a strong demand on public goods and services, which was only exacerbated with the economic crisis of the 1980s.  Further adding to the situation, the growth of urban employment in the informal economy not only restricted access of social rights to this segment of the population, but weakened the tax basis for the welfare state.<ref name=\"Reis\"/>  Under these circumstances, the minority with secured jobs and access to social rights essentially became a privileged segment of the population. This only increased the political, social, and economic inequality that characterized Brazil.\n\n==Democracy==\n1985 saw the return of civilian rule following the election of president [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]].  Following his elections he passed a series of constitutional amendments which extended suffrage; most notably by removing the literacy requirement that restricted votership.  The municipal elections of 1985 were the first elections in Brazil based on universal suffrage.  The following years the elections of Congress and state governors were also based on universal suffrage. These developments represented an important step towards the institutionalization of democracy in Brazil.<ref name=\"Mitchell and Wood\"/>\n\n===Constitution of 1988===\nThe promulgation of a new constitution in 1988, marked the formal shift from a military dictatorship to a democracy in Brazil.<ref>Wheeler</ref>  It was followed in 1989 by the first direct presidential elections in thirty years, and the first presidential elections to be based upon universal suffrage.\n\nIt lifted official barriers to political participation and formally protected political rights.  Like the constitutions before it, it denies status privileges and reaffirms the inviolability of private property and equality of all citizens before the law. It also strengthened the ''Afonso Arinos Law.'' Originally passed in 1951, it sought to punish racial discrimination by redefining racist practice as a crime rather than just a misdemeanor.  Under the new constitution it went further, denying bail to those convicted of racial or colour prejudice, and stipulating prison sentences.<ref name=\"Bethell\"/>\n\nThe constitution also restricted the power of the military, bolstered individual rights, and implemented means to protect marginalized groups.\n\n==Racial inequality in Brazil==\nPoverty and inequality are persistent in Brazil, largely as a result the legacy of Portuguese colonialism and its dependence on slave labor. The social, economic and political development of Brazil only tended to increase inequality, primarily among the non-white population. \"[It is] clear that the darker a Brazilian, the more likely he [is] to be found at the bottom of the socio-economic scale by every indicator- income, occupation, education [...] subtle but unmistakable discrimination in social relations remain[...] although it has never been codified since the colonial era.\"<ref>Skidmore</ref>\n\nDespite the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in Brazil, there remains a discrepancy between formal principles of the state the actualities of democracy in practice.<ref>inequalities</ref>  The effects of skin color exemplify this fact, often perpetuating the inequalities that universal citizenship claimed to remove.  Within Brazil, a large proportion of the population still lack basic citizenship rights, such as access to education. As a result, new forms of citizenship are developing independent of state control, like the situation in the [[favelas]].\n\nThere is a growing social, political, economic and spatial exclusion of people living in informal urban settlements like favelas.<ref>Wheeler, 36</ref>  As the state withdraws from providing social services from these areas, family and social networks step in and fill the gap.  This caused a growing informalization of political activity among these groups, whereby these citizens identify their participation in the local community as the core feature of citizenship. They have moved them away from the national discourse of rights-based democratic practices as their definition of citizenship, towards one expressed through specific forms of community participation.<ref>Wheeler, 37</ref>\n\n===Indians===\nSince the time of European colonization, Indians have been marginalized spatially, politically, and economically.  During the colonial period, the policy towards Indians was to exterminate them or to contain them in church settlements.<ref>Allen, 149</ref> From the establishment of the republic on, the state has actively pursued a policy aimed at assimilating these native groups, and integrating them into Brazilian society.<ref>Allen, 151</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Brazil]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n<references/>\n\n===Notations===\n\n*Allen, Elizabeth. \"Brazil: Indians and the new Constitution\".

In the early 1850s, the Reverend William Ritchie, who resided in [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] rather that Queanbeyan, commenced services four times a year in the old Kent Hotel. It was during this ministry that the local Presbyterian community succeeded in 1852 in obtaining a [[land grant|grant of land]] at the corner of Morisset and Lowe Streets for a church, school and manse.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-1>Lea-Scarlett, 1968</ref>{{rp|50}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2>Armour, 1974</ref>{{rp|8\u20139, 13}} The grant, which was apparently not formally gazetted until 13 December 1859, consisted of four contiguous allotments - Lots 1, 2, 3 and 20 - in Section 25, Town of Queanbeyan. Each of the allotments measured two roods in area. Lots 1 and 2 were intended for the church, Lot 3 for a school and Lot 20 fronting Lowe Street for the manse.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref>Town Map of Queanbeyan</ref>\n\nIn December 1861, Dr Andrew Morton, a Queanbeyan medical practitioner, called the local Presbyterians to a meeting to initiate the building of a church in the town. A subscription list was opened and, by the end of May 1862, Morton had secured promises of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]400. But there the matter lapsed. The Presbyterian community was beset with troubles, partly caused by the [[John Dunmore Lang|Rev. J. D. Lang]], and was unable to find a minister to settle permanently in the town. It was only in March 1870 that the situation took on a rather more settled aspect when the Reverend William Mackenzie arrived in town virtually direct from Scotland. He would reinvigorate the church building project, as well as fostering the building of churches in [[Canberra]] and in [[Bungendore]].<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|12\u201313, 19\u201320}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-3>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 7 July 1870:2</ref>\n\nAt a meeting following Mackenzie's formal induction to the Queanbeyan charge on 29 June 1870, his brother, the Reverend Simon Mackenzie of [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], approached several prominent members of the local Presbyterian community for donations to build a church. He received promised of A\u00a3275, notably A\u00a3100 from Charles McKeahnie of \"Booroomba\" and A\u00a350 from Dr Morton. It was estimated, however, that a sum of around A\u00a3750 would be needed for the construction and fitting out of the church.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-3/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-4>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 June 1870:2</ref> A Church Building Committee was formed with Morton as its chairman, but more than seven months on from Mackenzie's inauguration the committee had not raised sufficient funds to commence buildings.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-5>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 16 February 1871:2</ref>\n\nSix months later, a fresh effort was made to get the project underway when a meeting of the Church Building Committee was called for 12 August 1871. The newspaper advertisement for the meeting specifically requested the attendance of collectors, adding hopefully that \"in the interval they will exert themselves in gathering in all promised subscriptions\".<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-6>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 3 August 1871:3</ref> Evidently sufficient funds were collected for the committee soon afterwards engaged an architect to draw up plans and specifications for the building. The architect the committee chose for the task was the Reverend Alberto Dias Soares who was the local [[Anglican Church of Australia|Church of England]] minister and Rector or [[Christ Church, Queanbeyan|Christ Church]] in Queanbeyan. Soares had actually offered his services as an architect [[gratis]].<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n===Alberto Dias Soares===\nBorn in London in 1830, Soares was the son of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Consul]] and merchant, His Excellency Manoel Joachim Soares, and his English wife Camilla (n\u00e9e Lodington). He attended the Putney School for Civil Engineers in London in 1849\u20131850. Apart from an innate talent for drawing and art lessons in [[Oporto]] in 1847, his training as an engineer appears to have been his only qualification for undertaking architectural work. In August 1852, he departed for Australia with visions of a career in engineering and of furthering a grand scheme that had been proposed for a colonial railway. Once in Australia, however, he found that no-one was interested in the scheme. His life took a wholly new direction in 1855 when he felt, and answered, a call to the ministry of the Anglican Church. Taking Deacon's orders in May 1856, he was appointed to his first incumbency, Queanbeyan, in April 1857 and was ordained a priest on 7 June.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Death of the Rev.

The existing Christ Church had been built in 1844 and was quite an inadequeate structure. Soares thereupon designed a new church in Romanesque style and had it erected in 1859\u201360. The church now forms part of the heritage-listed Christ Church Anglican Group in Queanbeyan.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-7>{{cite NSW SHR|00043|Christ Church Anglican Group|fn=|hr|access-date= }}</ref> Church of England authorities swiftly awoke to Soares's value as an architect and, when the [[Anglican Diocese of Goulburn]] was formed in 1863, the foundation bishop appointed him Honorary Diocesan Architect.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-1/>{{rp|50\u201351}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-12>Wyatt, 1937</ref>{{rp|319}}<ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 13 October 1860:3</ref><ref name=Charlton/>{{rp|3\u20134}} During what would become nearly thirty years practice as an architect, Soares would eventually design at least sixteen churches, as well as major extensions to [[St John the Baptist Church, Reid]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]].<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-8>ACT Heritage Register No. 20019</ref> St Stephen's in Queanbeyan was the only Presbyterian church he designed; all the other churches were Church of England establishments.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nApart from his work as an architect for churches, Soares designed nine parsonages or rectories, three school buildings and two church halls. He undertook a small amount of private work as well, notably the Hibernia Lodge, a stately Gothic Revivial residence erected in Queanbeyan in 1865 and now listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-9>{{Cite NSW SHR|00514|Hibernia Lodge|fn=|hr|access-date= }}</ref> His private work included some role, probably in an advisory and supervisory capacity, for extensions to [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Duntroon House]] in 1862 and 1876<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-10>{{cite AHD|105448|Duntroon House|date=|access-date= }}</ref> and perhaps too for extensions to the stone Duntroon woolshed in the early 1860s.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-11>ACT Heritage Register No. 20040</ref><ref name=Charlton/>{{rp|3\u20139}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-12/>{{rp|185\u2013360}} He may also have designed St Matthew's Rectory in Kiewa Street, [[Albury]], in 1859 and the parsonage for St James' Church, [[Binda]], in 1874 based on information from the NSW State Heritage Inventory.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The architectural historian Morton Herman described Soares as \"an amateur architect of no mean ability\".<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-13>Herman, 1963:161</ref> The only comparable figure as a cleric architect in Australia is the Roman Catholic clergyman, Monsignor John Hawes (1876-1956) who practised in [[Western Australia]] in the period 1915\u201339.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-14>Evans, 1983</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nAlthough Soares designed buildings in such far-flung places as [[Balranald]] (St Barnabas' Church) and [[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] (St John's Church and Parsonage), it is not surprising that more of his buildings were erected in Queanbeyan than in any other location. He was based in Queanbeyan for twenty years and, during that time, designed seven buildings in the town. Two of them, a set of conjoined cottages in Rutledge Street and the Protestant Church Hall in Crawford Street, have been demolished, in {{circa|1983}} and 1994 respectively. Of the other five buildings, four are listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, three of them - Christ Church, the associated school extension (1864) and the Rectory (1875) - as part of the Christ Church Anglican Group. The other NSW State Heritage Register-listed structure is Hibernia Lodge. The remaining building is St Stephen's Church.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n====Design and construction of St Stephen's Church====\n\nSoares prepared plans and specifications for St Stephen's by October 1871. His design, which was for a fairly plain structure, was examined by the Church Building Committee on 20 October and it was probably at this time that its members requested a more ornamental appearance for the church. Soares obliged by adding buttresses to the design. These served no structural purpose and were purely for visual effect. They also added a sum of A\u00a3100 pounds to the cost of the building, a cost that was covered by contributions of A\u00a325 each from Dr Morton, Charles McKeahnie, Kenneth Cameron and Robert McKellar.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-15>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 12 October 1871:3</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-24/>{{rp|13}}\n\nAs construction was about to commence, the church in its final design was described as \"a neat gothic structure with a bell tower surmounted by a lofty spire. The walls are to be of rubble masonary in courses with axed quoins, the arches copings, etc., to be finished with Portland cement\".<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-16>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 18 April 1872:2</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nIn February 1872 the Reverend Mackenzie called for tenders to undertake the necessary works. As no suitable tenders were received, a further call for tenders was issued in the latter half of March. This yielded a positive result the following month when the committee accepted tenders from Thomas Priest for the masonry and Thomas Jordon for the carpentry and joinery.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-16/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-17>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 15 February 1872:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 21 March 1872:3</ref>\n\nThe other contractors to work on St Stephen's were John Evetts (or Evitts) for the plastering, Augustus Ferdinand Helmund for the paintiing and, notably, John Kealman for carpentry and joinery. They were all local tradesmen. Kealman was a builder in his own right who would go on to establish a large brickmaking enterprise in Queanbeyan, as well as building the neighbouring St Stephen's Manse in 1883. His contract at Stephen's was to fabricate the window frames, interior fittings like the pews, and the picket fence and gates that enclosed the church. He also designed and built the pulpit free of charge for the congregation.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-24/>{{rp|13}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-21/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-18>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 27 November 1873:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 16 January 1874:2</ref><ref>O'Keefe, 2010:14-15</ref>\n\nAt a ceremony on 16 May 1872, Charles McKeahnie's wife Elizabeth laid the foundation stone of the church. Work on the building then proceeded very slowly. The main reason for this was that the Building Committee had neglected to bind the contractors to any schedule. Eventually, still in an unfinshed state, the church was opened and the first service conducted in it on 8 March 1874. At this time, all of the church's window openings were covered with calico because the manufacturer had not yet supplied the stained glass windows. As well, a temporary fence of rough palings surrounded the church grounds because Kealman had been unable to obtain sufficient seasoned timber to complete the picket fence and gates. For the same reason, he had not been able to finish the pews, the church having to borrow seating from the Court House and the Methodist Church for the opening ceremony.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-19>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 23 May 1872:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 31 October 1872:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 7 March 1874:2</ref><ref name=\"QA18740311\">''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 11 March 1874:2</ref>\n\nOne highly satisfactory aspect of the opening was that the church had cleared all costs of construction and fitting out. The fees for the contractors on the building, the quarryman and the foundry, as well as sundry expenses, had amounted to A\u00a3583 pounds. It is unclear whether this amount included the additional 100 pounds for the decorative buttresses, but this cost had of course been met by four of the better-heeled members of the congregation.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-20>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 14 March 1874:2</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe new church was  [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Ecclesiastical Gothic|Victorian Gothic Revival]] in style, with some Early English features. With space to comfortably accommodate 150 worshippers, it consisted of a four-bay nave, a porch on its east-facing front and a vestry or session room on its western end. The body of the church contained ten lancet windows, while the porch had two such windows of smaller dimensions and the vestry one. Behind the pulpit in the western end of the church was a large quatrefoil window. The label moulds over the windows featured bosses with foliage motifs and those over the doors had bosses composed of the heads of Grecian figures. The frames of all the windows and doors were of oak. The building had a shingle roof and a barrel ceiling lined with varnished tongue-and-groove pine boards. Thomas Priest's masonry work on the church was described as \"superior to anything of the class in the district\" at the time.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nRising from the southwestern corner of the building was a low bell-tower surmounted by a spire sheathed in zinc. This was evidently not the lofty tower that was originally envisaged for the church. John Gale, the Honorary Secretary of the Church Building Committee, described the tower at the time of the church's opening as having a \"paltry appearance\". A Mr Holdsworth of [[Sydney]] donated a bell for the bell-tower, but this was quickly found to be inadequate. Two women members of the congregation then purchased a \"much larger and finer toned\" bell and donated it anonymously to the church; it was installed on 25 April 1874. At the same time, Kealman was at work erecting the picket fence around the building.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=Charlton/>{{rp|7}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-21>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 7 August 1873:2</ref><ref name=\"QA18740311\"/><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 25 April 1874:2</ref>\n\nSt Stephen's has remained substantially intact since it was built, though some improvements and other changes have been made both to its interior and exterior. The church was provided with a reed organ in 1885, but this was replaced with a better one in 1904 and then with a more elaborate and expensive Estey organ in August 1913. The Estey, which features philharmonic reeds and sizteen stops, is still in working order in the church. A significant addition was made to the fabric of the church after a storm destroyed the circular quatrefoil window in its western end in January 1896. A replacement circular window of stained glass was unveiled by Amy Steel, the wife of the minister, on 31 May 1896, the window depicting the burning bush accompanied by the Latin inscription \"nec tamen consumebatur\" ('and yet it was not being consumed'). It was made of 394 separate pieces of glass, each piece having to be handled six times during the manufacturing process.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|32\u201333}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-22>''Queanebyan Courier'', 2 June 1896</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 May 1896:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 3 June 1896:2</ref>\n\nOn 14 March 1897, less than a year after she unveiled the new window, Amy Steel died at the early age of 40. She was later commemorated by two memorials erected in the church. On 29 November 1910, at the time of the 50-year anniversary of the establishment of a Presbyterian charge in Queanbeyan, the congregation donated to the church in her honour a stained glass window bearing a Greek cross, Anchor Cross and \"IHS\", and the phrase from [[Revelation 2|Revelations 2:10]] \"Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life\". It was unveiled by Amy's daughter Ruby, who was the wife of the incumbent minister, the Reverend E. Sydney Henderson. At the same time, the family donated to Amy's memory a memorial tablet that was erected over the pulpit.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe 1910 jubilee ceremony was also the occasion on which Charles Henry McKeahnie presented to the church a baptismal font of prized Oamaru limestone from New Zealand. The font was in memory both of his parents, Charles and Elizabeth, who had been the church's leading benefactors, and of his two daughters, Jane and Sarah.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|34, 38}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-23>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 25 November 1910:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 2 December 1910:2</ref>\n\nAnother commemorative plaque was unveiled in the church on 12 September 1915, this one a memorial to 31 deceased pioneers of the church community. Paid for by their descendants, it featured the names of the pioneers inscribed on a sculptured tablet of Carrara marble mounted on a slab of polished black marble from Belgium. It was fixed to the wall at the western end of the nave behind the pulpit. In all, the monument weighed over {{convert|3|short cwt|kg|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|39, 60}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-24>Mackintosh-Carter, 1914</ref>\n\nThe onset of WWI prompted the placement of two further memorials in the church. On 13 August 1916, at the time of the second anniversary of the outbreak of the war, an \"Honor Board\" was erected in the church which carried the names of the men of the Queanbeyan-Canberra parish who had enlisted for service to that point. The board, of polished maple surmounted by a Gothic pediment, was donated by the families of the enlistees. A second honour board of Borneo cedar was unveiled in the church by Mrs John McInnes in October 1919.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|40, 45}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-25>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 18 July 1916:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 15 August 1916:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 September 1919:2</ref>\n\nDuring the war years, too, the church organist, Miss Violet Knox, donated a hymn board to the church. The board was unusual in that its face carried the badge of the Presbyterian Church with \"uniquely in the centre of it [was] inscribed the Hebrew characters of the Divine Name\". By this time, a gas supply had also been laid on to the church. In March 1930, Archibald McKeahnie, the eldest son of Charles, died leaving a gift of A\u00a350 to the church to be used as it saw fit. The money was used in 1936 to purchase five special chairs and a remodelled communion table.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|40, 51, 78}}\n\nA major change to the church grounds occurred in 1924 when St Stephen's Hall was erected on the same allotment as the church and immediately to its rear. The hall was designed by a Church Elder, J. D. McConnell, and built by voluntary labour. Officially opened on 7 October 1924, the building was a larger and sturdier structure than initially envisaged. McConnell took care, as well, to harmonise its design with that of the church. The building's roof matched the steeply-pitched roof of the church and it featured buttresses which, like those of the church, were purely ornamental. The principal purpose of the hall was as a venue for Sunday School, with attendances increasing markedly after the hall was opened. It was also available for hire and was used, for example, by the Salvation Army. The funds earned from rental helped to pay for the building, but most of the building costs were met by the sale of the vacant Lot 20 Section 25 fronting Lowe Street which had originally been intended as the site for the manse. Some time after 1974, additions were made to the northwestern side and rear (northeastern side) of the building.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|46\u201347}}\n\nA significant change to the church itself occurred in 1956 when the spire crowning the bell tower was blown down. George McInnes, a member of the congregation, provided funds for a new spire and it was erected by two other members of the congregation, C. Frommel and R. Hall.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|54}} At some unknown time, the church was also re-roofed with CGI sheeting, either replacing or covering the original shingles.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nOn 9 February 1963, Reg Fallick, a senior partner in the ''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'' and a lifelong member of the St Stephen's congregation, laid the foundation stone of a new hall to be erected on Lot 3 Section 25, on the opposite side of the manse to the church. Fallick donated A\u00a34,000 to the building project. The hall was officially opened on 31 August 1963 and, at the same time, a new brick fence was built across the Morisset Street frontage of the whole church property. This replaced a picket fence erected in 1907 which itself had replaced Kealman's original picket fence. An iron fence which had also been built in 1907 remained along the Lowe Street frontage until a picket fence was erected after 1974. Reg Fallick died the year after the new hall was built and it was thereafter named \"Fallick Hall\" in his honour. The hall was rented out for a pre-school and other community purposes.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|55\u201357}}\n\nInside the church, Kealman's pulpit was moved from its original central position to the southwestern side in 1964. This was to permit easier access to the vestry, especially for wedding parties. At the same time, the side rail and bible rest were lowered and the width reduced by {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m|order=flip}}.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|56}} At an unknown recent date, a sloping concrete ramp with tubular iron side rails was added to the front of the church leading to the front door.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n=== St Stephen's Manse ===\n\nThe manse is one of a very few private or non-government buildings that Barnet designed during his long career in NSW. Before he entered government service, he was the architect for a couple of houses in [[Phillip Street, Sydney]], some shops in Sussex Street and the Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Chalmers Street, [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]]. Of these, only the church now survives. Known today as the Welsh Presbyterian Church, it and St Stephen's Manse are the only remaining examples of Barnet's work as an architect of private buildings.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-31>Johnston, Bingham-Hall, and Kohane, 2000:26</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-40>Bridges and McDonald, 1988</ref>{{rp|28\u201329}}\n\nBarnet designed the manse free of charge for the Reverend Robert Alexander Streel, MA, his wife Amy and their family in 1881. Amy Steel was Barnet's eldest daughter. When the Reverend Steel was appointed to Queanbeyan in May 1881, there was no manse in the whole charge nor even any other suitable premises in the town for him and his family to occupy. They were forced to put up in Bungendore until a manse was provided for them in Queanbeyan. For this purpose, the church formed a Manse Building Committee soon after Steel's appointment.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=PAW>''The Presbyterian and Australian Witness'', 4 June 1881:5</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-32>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 24 May 1881:4</ref>\n\nBarnet produced plans and specifications for the manse by September 1881. It comprised a six-room brick cottage on a stone foundation, with an attached kitchen and 'Servant's Room'. No early start was made on construction, however, because the Building Committee was unable to raise sufficient funds. Probably in a bid to cut the costs of construction, the committee approved some unspecified modifications to the plans. In the end, it was to be more than twelve months before the committee members felt that they had just enough money in hand to call for tenders. Inevitably, of those contractors who submitted tenders, the committee chose the cheapest.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-33>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 29 September 1881:4</ref>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 1 November 1881:4</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 26 September 1882:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 17 October 1882:3</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 14 November 1882:2</ref>\n\nIt was not a wise option. Within three months, it became clear that the successful tenderer, a builder from Woodhouselee near Goulburn, was unable to fulfil the contract. In fact, he had not even made a start. At this impasse, the committee turned to a trusted local contractor, John Kealman. Although his final price of A\u00a3650 was well above the A\u00a3509 quoted by the failed Woodhouselee tenderer, Kealman and his work were well known to church members. Not only was he a member of the church's congregation, but in the 1870s he had carried out the carpentry for St Stephen's and had even designed, built and donated the pulpit to the church.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=\"PAW18830331\">''The Presbyterian and Australian Witness'', 31 March 1883:5</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-34>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 January 1883:2</ref>\n\nKealman was well credentialled and equipped to perform the work. After working as a carpenter on George Campbell's Duntroon property in the 1860s, he had learned how to make good quality bricks and moved into the building trade as a contractor in his own right. In 1875, he built the original St John's Presbyterian Church in Bungendore and, in 1876\u201378, rebuilt the spire of St John's Church in Canberra. A string of government contracts soon followed. He constructed additions to the Queanbeyan Court House and Gaol in 1877 and 1878 respectively, and erected the Bungendore Public School in 1879, the Queanbeyan Post Office in 1879\u201380, the [[Gundaroo]] Court House in 1882-83 and the [[Sutton, New South Wales|Sutton]] Public School in 1882\u201383.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nTo enhance his business and the quality of his work, Kealman had established an imported brickmaking machine on the Garryowen Estate in Queanbeyan in 1879. This enterprise, the first of its kind in southern NSW, produced 4,000 high-quality bricks per day. Kealman would have used these bricks in the construction of the manse.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-35>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 18 June 1879:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 9 August 1879:2</ref>\n\nIt was distinctly in Kealman's favour, too - and a reassurance to the Manse Building Committee - that Barnet was familiar with and approved of his work. During a visit to Queanbeyan in October 1881, Barnet had carried out a careful inspection of the construction of further additions to the Court House, for which Kealman was the contractor. On completing the inspection, Barnet expressed complete satisfaction with the standard of workmanship.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-36>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 13 October 1881:4</ref> Indeed, Barnet probably had previous acquaintance with Kealman's work. Kealman had erected the Queanbeyan Police Barracks or Police Sergeant's Residence, now the Queanbeyan Historical Museum, in 1875-76 and the town's Post Office in 1879\u201380, both of which Barnet may have designed or at least would have been closely associated with.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nKealman signed the contract to build the manse in January 1883 after \"certain deviations from the plans\" had been agreed upon.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 27 March 1883:2</ref> It is likely that the purpose of these \"deviations\" was to lower costs. One such deviation may have comprised the laying of Kealman's bricks in colonial bond on the less visible western side and rear of the building, in contrast to the use of English bond on the front and eastern sides. This strategy would have reduced the number of bricks and hence the cost of the construction.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe work of construction commenced in February 1883 and proceeded rapidly. The foundation stone of the building was laid at a ceremony on 22 March 1883 and, in May, work had advanced to the point where Kealman was able to roof in both the main building and the kitchen attachment. But a shortage of funds threatened the completion of work. At the end of June, the Building Committee remained 200 pounds shy of the figure required. Steel, thereupon, decided to launch an appeal for funds from the wider Presbyterian community. Through weekly advertisement in ''The Presbyterian and Australian Witness'', he entreated Presbyterians in Sydney and other parts of the colony to make gifts of work or money so that a fund-raising \"Sale of Work\" could be held in late September. The appeal was evidently successful. The manse was completed in November, enabling Steel and his family to take up residence from their temporary refuge in Bungendore.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=\"PAW18830331\"/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-38>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 6 February 1883:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 8 May 1883:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 June 1883:5-6</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 3 November 1883:5</ref><ref>''[[Goulburn Herald]]'', 29 November 1883:2</ref>\n\nA photograph dating from {{circa|1886}} shows the manse just a few years after its completion. Apart from the white picket fence which had been replaced by a brick fence, the front aspect of the building is unchanged. The roofline, chimneys, bay window, verandah, unrendered brickwork, awning over the windows on the eastern side and even the bargeboards remain today exactly as they were when the manse was erected. The interior of the building also remains largely intact. It retains original fireplaces, architraves, some pressed metal ceilings, and mantelpieces donated by Hudson Brothers Timber Merchants of Sydney in 1883.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=\"PAW18830331\"/>\n\nWhile the original roof has been replaced by a new CGI roof, the principal change to the manse has been the building of an extension onto the eastern side of the structure at its rear. Now largely hidden by shrubs, the extension was built to match the original brickwork and window details. It may have been erected in the late 1880s or early 1890s, perhaps by Kealman, to accommodate the Steels' growing family. They eventually had seven children.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nAlthough as a private dwelling the manse is a departure from government buildings that Barnet designed, in some degree it resembles some of the smaller official structure that either he personally or the Colonial Architect's Office designed in the \"house style\" he had established. These structures included police barracks and quarters for staff of lighthouses. Nevertheless, where these buildings embody the sober and solemn quality that Barnet intended for official structures, the manse exhibits a rather more homely, genial and welcoming character while still retaining an air of dignity and respectability. This Barnet achieved without resorting to the use of Picturesque and other new-fangled architectural ornamentation to which, by temperament and professional inclination, he was in any case vehemently opposed.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-40/>{{rp|13, 51\u201352, 54\u201355}}\n\n== Description ==\n===St Stephen's Church===\nA small rural Gothic Revival church with some English features. Built of stone with a steeply-pitched corrogated iron roof (originally shingles). The exterior walls have buttressess which serve no structural function, but were built as an ornamental feature. Rising from the southwestern corner of the building is a low bell tower. It is surmounted by a [[spire]] that was constructed in 1956 after the original one was blown down and destoyed in high winds.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe church is a rectangular building orientated southeast\u2013northwest. It has a four-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] nave, a [[porch]] on its front end, and a vestry or session room at its rear. There are ten lancet windows in the body of the church with two smaller examples in the porch and one in the vestry. The window and door frames are of oak. The window label moulds feature bosses with foliage motifs and the door label moulds feature bosses that are composed of the heads of Grecian figures. Behind the pulpit in the northern end of the nave is a large circular [[quatrefoil]] window that was installed in 1896. The nave has a barrel ceiling lined with varninshed [[Tongue and groove|tongue-and-groove]] pine boards.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n===Manse===\nA single-storey brick cottage with attached kitchen and servant's room. It has a [[Hipped roof|hipped]] and gabled roof sheathed in [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]], which is not the original covering. There are two multi-[[corbel]] [[chimneys]], decorative barge boards and a [[finial]], and a front [[veranda]]h with a [[skillion roof]] supported by slender timber [[columns]] with decorative timber [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. The front of the cottage features a large rectangular [[bay window]]. The cottage brick work is laid in Colonial bond on the less visible western side and rear of the building. On the front and eastern side the bricks are laid in [[Brickwork|English bond]]. The interior retains original details, such as fireplaces, [[architraves]], some [[pressed metal ceiling]]s and mantel pieces. However, the fireplaces have been boarded up to prevent drafts in the recent past.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 3 July 2019, the church is in excellent condition. However, it does require some maintenance works on its interior [[lighting]] and electrical system and to its structural walls to stop water penetration though the stonework.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe manse is in reasonable condition, but has not been lived in for some time. It has recently undergone maintenance works funded by Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council to restore its exterior. This included restoration work on its bay window.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe Manse was extended on its rear side in the late 1880s ot early 1890s in a sympathetic manner. A further extension was undertaken on its northern side potentially in the 1990s.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 2 August 2017, St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse are of state significance as a small, intact and harmonious ecclesiastical precinct.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe small rural gothic revival church is of state significance for its historic, associative, aesthetic, rarity, and representative values. It is the only non-Anglican church designed by Reverend Alberto Dias Soares, Honorary Diocesan Architect of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn between 1863 and 1888. He is one of only two cleric-architects known to have practiced in Australia and the only one to have worked in NSW. During his career Soares designed 31 known buildings across southern NSW, mainly churches and parsonages, and today 26 are extant. He is responsible for populating much of southern NSW with aesthetical pleasing and ecclesiastical appropriate architecture for the Anglican Church throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. This church is also noteworthy as an attractive, well-designed and constructed example of the kind of modest Presbyterian churches built in country areas of NSW during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe Manse is of state significance for its associative, aesthetic, rarity, and representative values. It is the only extant private domestic building of the three designed by James Barnet, NSW Colonial Architect (1865-1890), during his long architectural career. Barnet designed the manse for his eldest daughter Amy Steel and her family. Amy's husband Robert Steel was minister at St Stephen's for almost seventeen years between 1881 and 1897. This building displays a different side of Barnet's architectural character in comparison to his vast portfolio of government work. While resembling the smaller official structures he designed it has a more homely and welcoming character that retains an air of dignity and respectability appropriate for a Presbyterian minister. Overall, this Manse displays two often overlooked parts of Barnet's character: his strong family devotion and religious conviction.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 May 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state historic significance as it was designed by the only cleric-architect known to have practiced in NSW, Reverend Alberto Dias Soares, Honorary Diocesan Architect of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn between 1863 and 1888. There has only been one other cleric-architect who worked in Australia, Monsignor John Hawes, who lived and worked in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state significance for its strong association with the cleric-architect Reverend Alberto Dias Soares (1830-1909). He is the only cleric-architect to have operated in NSW and during his architectural career between roughly 1859 and 1877 he designed and built 31 buildings, mostly churches and parsonages. These were mostly in the Diocese of Goulburn, for which he was Honorary Diocesan Architect between 1863 and 1888. However, at this time this diocese spread across southern NSW all the way to Wentworth. Among these items this church is special, as it was the only non-Anglican ecclesiastical structure he designed. Despite this being an act of kindness on his behalf, he earned the censure of his superiors for assisting the Anglican church's rivals.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse is of state significance for its strong association with James Barnet (1827-1904), NSW Colonial Architect between 1865 and 1890. During his long career he designed and built a large range of government buildings. However, outside of this office he is known to have designed only three private domestic buildings of which this manse is the only extant example. Barnett designed the building for his eldest daughter Amy Steel (1857-1897) and her family. Her husband, Reverend Robert Alexander Steel (1854-1916), was the minister of St Stephen's between 1881 and 1897.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state aesthetic significance as it exhibits some noteworthy aesthetic characteristics of the gothic revival style in small rural churches. Specifically, the quality masonry work, lancet windows, label moulds adorned with bosses over the windows and doors, and circular stained-glass window. An unusual creative innovation in the design and construction of the church is the clever use of diagonal buttresses to support the corner belfry.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse is of state aesthetic significance as it displays aesthetic characteristics of a high order for a domestic structure that is of relatively modest scale. The unaltered characteristics since construction include the hipped and gabled roof, multi-corbel chimneys, decorative barge boards, finial, bay window and skillion-roofed front verandah supported by timber posts with ornate timber brackets. These various elements combine in a harmonious and well-proportioned whole.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is rare in a state context as the only non-Anglican church designed by the cleric-architect, Reverend Alberto Dias Soares, Honorary Diocesan Architect of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn between 1863 and 1888.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse is rare in a state context as the only extant private domestic building of the three designed by James Barnett, NSW Colonial Architect (1864-1890), throughout his long architectural career.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state representative significance as a fine intact example of the kind of modest Presbyterian churches built in country areas of NSW in the nineteenth century. It reflects the fashionable gothic revival design of these churches, as well as solid, high standard of construction in stone.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse has state representative significance as a fine and intact example of a nineteenth century clergyman's residence considering it was designed by such a distinguished architect. Furthermore, it is representative of Barnet's work in the private domain, displaying his abilities is a sphere outside the government structures he usually designed.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New South Wales|Christianity|Calvinism}}\n* [[Australian non-residential architectural styles]]\n* [[List of Presbyterian and Reformed denominations in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Armour|first=Jan|date=1974|title=And this Stone: The story of St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Queanbeyan}}\n* {{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Graeme|date=2016|title=God's Architect, The churches and parsonages of Alberto Soares}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Bridges, Peter |author2=McDonald, Don|date=1988|title=James Barnet Colonial Architect}}\n* {{cite book|last=Charlton|first=Ken|date=1998|title=Southern Spires}}\n* {{cite book|author=Cross, Rex L.|date=1985|title=Bygone Queanbeyan |edition=Revised}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Cross, Rex L. |author2=Sheedy, Bert|date=1983|title=Queanbeyan Pioneers - First Study}}\n* {{cite web|last=Evans|first=A.

In the early 1850s, the Reverend William Ritchie, who resided in [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] rather that Queanbeyan, commenced services four times a year in the old Kent Hotel. It was during this ministry that the local Presbyterian community succeeded in 1852 in obtaining a [[land grant|grant of land]] at the corner of Morisset and Lowe Streets for a church, school and manse.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-1>Lea-Scarlett, 1968</ref>{{rp|50}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2>Armour, 1974</ref>{{rp|8\u20139, 13}} The grant, which was apparently not formally gazetted until 13 December 1859, consisted of four contiguous allotments - Lots 1, 2, 3 and 20 - in Section 25, Town of Queanbeyan. Each of the allotments measured two roods in area. Lots 1 and 2 were intended for the church, Lot 3 for a school and Lot 20 fronting Lowe Street for the manse.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref>Town Map of Queanbeyan</ref>\n\nIn December 1861, Dr Andrew Morton, a Queanbeyan medical practitioner, called the local Presbyterians to a meeting to initiate the building of a church in the town. A subscription list was opened and, by the end of May 1862, Morton had secured promises of [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]400. But there the matter lapsed. The Presbyterian community was beset with troubles, partly caused by the [[John Dunmore Lang|Rev. J. D. Lang]], and was unable to find a minister to settle permanently in the town. It was only in March 1870 that the situation took on a rather more settled aspect when the Reverend William Mackenzie arrived in town virtually direct from Scotland. He would reinvigorate the church building project, as well as fostering the building of churches in [[Canberra]] and in [[Bungendore]].<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|12\u201313, 19\u201320}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-3>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 7 July 1870:2</ref>\n\nAt a meeting following Mackenzie's formal induction to the Queanbeyan charge on 29 June 1870, his brother, the Reverend Simon Mackenzie of [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], approached several prominent members of the local Presbyterian community for donations to build a church. He received promised of A\u00a3275, notably A\u00a3100 from Charles McKeahnie of \"Booroomba\" and A\u00a350 from Dr Morton. It was estimated, however, that a sum of around A\u00a3750 would be needed for the construction and fitting out of the church.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-3/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-4>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 June 1870:2</ref> A Church Building Committee was formed with Morton as its chairman, but more than seven months on from Mackenzie's inauguration the committee had not raised sufficient funds to commence buildings.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-5>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 16 February 1871:2</ref>\n\nSix months later, a fresh effort was made to get the project underway when a meeting of the Church Building Committee was called for 12 August 1871. The newspaper advertisement for the meeting specifically requested the attendance of collectors, adding hopefully that \"in the interval they will exert themselves in gathering in all promised subscriptions\".<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-6>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 3 August 1871:3</ref> Evidently sufficient funds were collected for the committee soon afterwards engaged an architect to draw up plans and specifications for the building. The architect the committee chose for the task was the Reverend Alberto Dias Soares who was the local [[Anglican Church of Australia|Church of England]] minister and Rector or [[Christ Church, Queanbeyan|Christ Church]] in Queanbeyan. Soares had actually offered his services as an architect [[gratis]].<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n===Alberto Dias Soares===\nBorn in London in 1830, Soares was the son of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Consul]] and merchant, His Excellency Manoel Joachim Soares, and his English wife Camilla (n\u00e9e Lodington). He attended the Putney School for Civil Engineers in London in 1849\u20131850. Apart from an innate talent for drawing and art lessons in [[Oporto]] in 1847, his training as an engineer appears to have been his only qualification for undertaking architectural work. In August 1852, he departed for Australia with visions of a career in engineering and of furthering a grand scheme that had been proposed for a colonial railway. Once in Australia, however, he found that no-one was interested in the scheme. His life took a wholly new direction in 1855 when he felt, and answered, a call to the ministry of the Anglican Church. Taking Deacon's orders in May 1856, he was appointed to his first incumbency, Queanbeyan, in April 1857 and was ordained a priest on 7 June.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Death of the Rev.

The existing Christ Church had been built in 1844 and was quite an inadequeate structure. Soares thereupon designed a new church in Romanesque style and had it erected in 1859\u201360. The church now forms part of the heritage-listed Christ Church Anglican Group in Queanbeyan.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-7>{{cite NSW SHR|00043|Christ Church Anglican Group|fn=|hr|access-date= }}</ref> Church of England authorities swiftly awoke to Soares's value as an architect and, when the [[Anglican Diocese of Goulburn]] was formed in 1863, the foundation bishop appointed him Honorary Diocesan Architect.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-1/>{{rp|50\u201351}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-12>Wyatt, 1937</ref>{{rp|319}}<ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 13 October 1860:3</ref><ref name=Charlton/>{{rp|3\u20134}} During what would become nearly thirty years practice as an architect, Soares would eventually design at least sixteen churches, as well as major extensions to [[St John the Baptist Church, Reid]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]].<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-8>ACT Heritage Register No. 20019</ref> St Stephen's in Queanbeyan was the only Presbyterian church he designed; all the other churches were Church of England establishments.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nApart from his work as an architect for churches, Soares designed nine parsonages or rectories, three school buildings and two church halls. He undertook a small amount of private work as well, notably the Hibernia Lodge, a stately Gothic Revivial residence erected in Queanbeyan in 1865 and now listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-9>{{Cite NSW SHR|00514|Hibernia Lodge|fn=|hr|access-date= }}</ref> His private work included some role, probably in an advisory and supervisory capacity, for extensions to [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Duntroon House]] in 1862 and 1876<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-10>{{cite AHD|105448|Duntroon House|date=|access-date= }}</ref> and perhaps too for extensions to the stone Duntroon woolshed in the early 1860s.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-11>ACT Heritage Register No. 20040</ref><ref name=Charlton/>{{rp|3\u20139}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-12/>{{rp|185\u2013360}} He may also have designed St Matthew's Rectory in Kiewa Street, [[Albury]], in 1859 and the parsonage for St James' Church, [[Binda]], in 1874 based on information from the NSW State Heritage Inventory.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The architectural historian Morton Herman described Soares as \"an amateur architect of no mean ability\".<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-13>Herman, 1963:161</ref> The only comparable figure as a cleric architect in Australia is the Roman Catholic clergyman, Monsignor John Hawes (1876-1956) who practised in [[Western Australia]] in the period 1915\u201339.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-14>Evans, 1983</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nAlthough Soares designed buildings in such far-flung places as [[Balranald]] (St Barnabas' Church) and [[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] (St John's Church and Parsonage), it is not surprising that more of his buildings were erected in Queanbeyan than in any other location. He was based in Queanbeyan for twenty years and, during that time, designed seven buildings in the town. Two of them, a set of conjoined cottages in Rutledge Street and the Protestant Church Hall in Crawford Street, have been demolished, in {{circa|1983}} and 1994 respectively. Of the other five buildings, four are listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, three of them - Christ Church, the associated school extension (1864) and the Rectory (1875) - as part of the Christ Church Anglican Group. The other NSW State Heritage Register-listed structure is Hibernia Lodge. The remaining building is St Stephen's Church.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n====Design and construction of St Stephen's Church====\n\nSoares prepared plans and specifications for St Stephen's by October 1871. His design, which was for a fairly plain structure, was examined by the Church Building Committee on 20 October and it was probably at this time that its members requested a more ornamental appearance for the church. Soares obliged by adding buttresses to the design. These served no structural purpose and were purely for visual effect. They also added a sum of A\u00a3100 pounds to the cost of the building, a cost that was covered by contributions of A\u00a325 each from Dr Morton, Charles McKeahnie, Kenneth Cameron and Robert McKellar.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-15>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 12 October 1871:3</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-24/>{{rp|13}}\n\nAs construction was about to commence, the church in its final design was described as \"a neat gothic structure with a bell tower surmounted by a lofty spire. The walls are to be of rubble masonary in courses with axed quoins, the arches copings, etc., to be finished with Portland cement\".<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-16>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 18 April 1872:2</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nIn February 1872 the Reverend Mackenzie called for tenders to undertake the necessary works. As no suitable tenders were received, a further call for tenders was issued in the latter half of March. This yielded a positive result the following month when the committee accepted tenders from Thomas Priest for the masonry and Thomas Jordon for the carpentry and joinery.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-16/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-17>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 15 February 1872:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 21 March 1872:3</ref>\n\nThe other contractors to work on St Stephen's were John Evetts (or Evitts) for the plastering, Augustus Ferdinand Helmund for the paintiing and, notably, John Kealman for carpentry and joinery. They were all local tradesmen. Kealman was a builder in his own right who would go on to establish a large brickmaking enterprise in Queanbeyan, as well as building the neighbouring St Stephen's Manse in 1883. His contract at Stephen's was to fabricate the window frames, interior fittings like the pews, and the picket fence and gates that enclosed the church. He also designed and built the pulpit free of charge for the congregation.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-24/>{{rp|13}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-21/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-18>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 27 November 1873:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 16 January 1874:2</ref><ref>O'Keefe, 2010:14-15</ref>\n\nAt a ceremony on 16 May 1872, Charles McKeahnie's wife Elizabeth laid the foundation stone of the church. Work on the building then proceeded very slowly. The main reason for this was that the Building Committee had neglected to bind the contractors to any schedule. Eventually, still in an unfinshed state, the church was opened and the first service conducted in it on 8 March 1874. At this time, all of the church's window openings were covered with calico because the manufacturer had not yet supplied the stained glass windows. As well, a temporary fence of rough palings surrounded the church grounds because Kealman had been unable to obtain sufficient seasoned timber to complete the picket fence and gates. For the same reason, he had not been able to finish the pews, the church having to borrow seating from the Court House and the Methodist Church for the opening ceremony.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-19>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 23 May 1872:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 31 October 1872:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 7 March 1874:2</ref><ref name=\"QA18740311\">''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 11 March 1874:2</ref>\n\nOne highly satisfactory aspect of the opening was that the church had cleared all costs of construction and fitting out. The fees for the contractors on the building, the quarryman and the foundry, as well as sundry expenses, had amounted to A\u00a3583 pounds. It is unclear whether this amount included the additional 100 pounds for the decorative buttresses, but this cost had of course been met by four of the better-heeled members of the congregation.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-20>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 14 March 1874:2</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe new church was  [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Ecclesiastical Gothic|Victorian Gothic Revival]] in style, with some Early English features. With space to comfortably accommodate 150 worshippers, it consisted of a four-bay nave, a porch on its east-facing front and a vestry or session room on its western end. The body of the church contained ten lancet windows, while the porch had two such windows of smaller dimensions and the vestry one. Behind the pulpit in the western end of the church was a large quatrefoil window. The label moulds over the windows featured bosses with foliage motifs and those over the doors had bosses composed of the heads of Grecian figures. The frames of all the windows and doors were of oak. The building had a shingle roof and a barrel ceiling lined with varnished tongue-and-groove pine boards. Thomas Priest's masonry work on the church was described as \"superior to anything of the class in the district\" at the time.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nRising from the southwestern corner of the building was a low bell-tower surmounted by a spire sheathed in zinc. This was evidently not the lofty tower that was originally envisaged for the church. John Gale, the Honorary Secretary of the Church Building Committee, described the tower at the time of the church's opening as having a \"paltry appearance\". A Mr Holdsworth of [[Sydney]] donated a bell for the bell-tower, but this was quickly found to be inadequate. Two women members of the congregation then purchased a \"much larger and finer toned\" bell and donated it anonymously to the church; it was installed on 25 April 1874. At the same time, Kealman was at work erecting the picket fence around the building.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=Charlton/>{{rp|7}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-21>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 7 August 1873:2</ref><ref name=\"QA18740311\"/><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 25 April 1874:2</ref>\n\nSt Stephen's has remained substantially intact since it was built, though some improvements and other changes have been made both to its interior and exterior. The church was provided with a reed organ in 1885, but this was replaced with a better one in 1904 and then with a more elaborate and expensive Estey organ in August 1913. The Estey, which features philharmonic reeds and sizteen stops, is still in working order in the church. A significant addition was made to the fabric of the church after a storm destroyed the circular quatrefoil window in its western end in January 1896. A replacement circular window of stained glass was unveiled by Amy Steel, the wife of the minister, on 31 May 1896, the window depicting the burning bush accompanied by the Latin inscription \"nec tamen consumebatur\" ('and yet it was not being consumed'). It was made of 394 separate pieces of glass, each piece having to be handled six times during the manufacturing process.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|32\u201333}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-22>''Queanebyan Courier'', 2 June 1896</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 May 1896:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 3 June 1896:2</ref>\n\nOn 14 March 1897, less than a year after she unveiled the new window, Amy Steel died at the early age of 40. She was later commemorated by two memorials erected in the church. On 29 November 1910, at the time of the 50-year anniversary of the establishment of a Presbyterian charge in Queanbeyan, the congregation donated to the church in her honour a stained glass window bearing a Greek cross, Anchor Cross and \"IHS\", and the phrase from [[Revelation 2|Revelations 2:10]] \"Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life\". It was unveiled by Amy's daughter Ruby, who was the wife of the incumbent minister, the Reverend E. Sydney Henderson. At the same time, the family donated to Amy's memory a memorial tablet that was erected over the pulpit.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe 1910 jubilee ceremony was also the occasion on which Charles Henry McKeahnie presented to the church a baptismal font of prized Oamaru limestone from New Zealand. The font was in memory both of his parents, Charles and Elizabeth, who had been the church's leading benefactors, and of his two daughters, Jane and Sarah.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|34, 38}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-23>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 25 November 1910:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 2 December 1910:2</ref>\n\nAnother commemorative plaque was unveiled in the church on 12 September 1915, this one a memorial to 31 deceased pioneers of the church community. Paid for by their descendants, it featured the names of the pioneers inscribed on a sculptured tablet of Carrara marble mounted on a slab of polished black marble from Belgium. It was fixed to the wall at the western end of the nave behind the pulpit. In all, the monument weighed over {{convert|3|short cwt|kg|0|order=flip}}.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|39, 60}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-24>Mackintosh-Carter, 1914</ref>\n\nThe onset of WWI prompted the placement of two further memorials in the church. On 13 August 1916, at the time of the second anniversary of the outbreak of the war, an \"Honor Board\" was erected in the church which carried the names of the men of the Queanbeyan-Canberra parish who had enlisted for service to that point. The board, of polished maple surmounted by a Gothic pediment, was donated by the families of the enlistees. A second honour board of Borneo cedar was unveiled in the church by Mrs John McInnes in October 1919.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|40, 45}}<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-25>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 18 July 1916:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 15 August 1916:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 September 1919:2</ref>\n\nDuring the war years, too, the church organist, Miss Violet Knox, donated a hymn board to the church. The board was unusual in that its face carried the badge of the Presbyterian Church with \"uniquely in the centre of it [was] inscribed the Hebrew characters of the Divine Name\". By this time, a gas supply had also been laid on to the church. In March 1930, Archibald McKeahnie, the eldest son of Charles, died leaving a gift of A\u00a350 to the church to be used as it saw fit. The money was used in 1936 to purchase five special chairs and a remodelled communion table.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|40, 51, 78}}\n\nA major change to the church grounds occurred in 1924 when St Stephen's Hall was erected on the same allotment as the church and immediately to its rear. The hall was designed by a Church Elder, J. D. McConnell, and built by voluntary labour. Officially opened on 7 October 1924, the building was a larger and sturdier structure than initially envisaged. McConnell took care, as well, to harmonise its design with that of the church. The building's roof matched the steeply-pitched roof of the church and it featured buttresses which, like those of the church, were purely ornamental. The principal purpose of the hall was as a venue for Sunday School, with attendances increasing markedly after the hall was opened. It was also available for hire and was used, for example, by the Salvation Army. The funds earned from rental helped to pay for the building, but most of the building costs were met by the sale of the vacant Lot 20 Section 25 fronting Lowe Street which had originally been intended as the site for the manse. Some time after 1974, additions were made to the northwestern side and rear (northeastern side) of the building.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|46\u201347}}\n\nA significant change to the church itself occurred in 1956 when the spire crowning the bell tower was blown down. George McInnes, a member of the congregation, provided funds for a new spire and it was erected by two other members of the congregation, C. Frommel and R. Hall.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|54}} At some unknown time, the church was also re-roofed with CGI sheeting, either replacing or covering the original shingles.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nOn 9 February 1963, Reg Fallick, a senior partner in the ''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'' and a lifelong member of the St Stephen's congregation, laid the foundation stone of a new hall to be erected on Lot 3 Section 25, on the opposite side of the manse to the church. Fallick donated A\u00a34,000 to the building project. The hall was officially opened on 31 August 1963 and, at the same time, a new brick fence was built across the Morisset Street frontage of the whole church property. This replaced a picket fence erected in 1907 which itself had replaced Kealman's original picket fence. An iron fence which had also been built in 1907 remained along the Lowe Street frontage until a picket fence was erected after 1974. Reg Fallick died the year after the new hall was built and it was thereafter named \"Fallick Hall\" in his honour. The hall was rented out for a pre-school and other community purposes.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|55\u201357}}\n\nInside the church, Kealman's pulpit was moved from its original central position to the southwestern side in 1964. This was to permit easier access to the vestry, especially for wedding parties. At the same time, the side rail and bible rest were lowered and the width reduced by {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m|order=flip}}.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|56}} At an unknown recent date, a sloping concrete ramp with tubular iron side rails was added to the front of the church leading to the front door.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n=== St Stephen's Manse ===\n\nThe manse is one of a very few private or non-government buildings that Barnet designed during his long career in NSW. Before he entered government service, he was the architect for a couple of houses in [[Phillip Street, Sydney]], some shops in Sussex Street and the Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Chalmers Street, [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]]. Of these, only the church now survives. Known today as the Welsh Presbyterian Church, it and St Stephen's Manse are the only remaining examples of Barnet's work as an architect of private buildings.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-31>Johnston, Bingham-Hall, and Kohane, 2000:26</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-40>Bridges and McDonald, 1988</ref>{{rp|28\u201329}}\n\nBarnet designed the manse free of charge for the Reverend Robert Alexander Streel, MA, his wife Amy and their family in 1881. Amy Steel was Barnet's eldest daughter. When the Reverend Steel was appointed to Queanbeyan in May 1881, there was no manse in the whole charge nor even any other suitable premises in the town for him and his family to occupy. They were forced to put up in Bungendore until a manse was provided for them in Queanbeyan. For this purpose, the church formed a Manse Building Committee soon after Steel's appointment.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=PAW>''The Presbyterian and Australian Witness'', 4 June 1881:5</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-32>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 24 May 1881:4</ref>\n\nBarnet produced plans and specifications for the manse by September 1881. It comprised a six-room brick cottage on a stone foundation, with an attached kitchen and 'Servant's Room'. No early start was made on construction, however, because the Building Committee was unable to raise sufficient funds. Probably in a bid to cut the costs of construction, the committee approved some unspecified modifications to the plans. In the end, it was to be more than twelve months before the committee members felt that they had just enough money in hand to call for tenders. Inevitably, of those contractors who submitted tenders, the committee chose the cheapest.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-33>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 29 September 1881:4</ref>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 1 November 1881:4</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 26 September 1882:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 17 October 1882:3</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 14 November 1882:2</ref>\n\nIt was not a wise option. Within three months, it became clear that the successful tenderer, a builder from Woodhouselee near Goulburn, was unable to fulfil the contract. In fact, he had not even made a start. At this impasse, the committee turned to a trusted local contractor, John Kealman. Although his final price of A\u00a3650 was well above the A\u00a3509 quoted by the failed Woodhouselee tenderer, Kealman and his work were well known to church members. Not only was he a member of the church's congregation, but in the 1870s he had carried out the carpentry for St Stephen's and had even designed, built and donated the pulpit to the church.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-2/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=\"PAW18830331\">''The Presbyterian and Australian Witness'', 31 March 1883:5</ref><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-34>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 January 1883:2</ref>\n\nKealman was well credentialled and equipped to perform the work. After working as a carpenter on George Campbell's Duntroon property in the 1860s, he had learned how to make good quality bricks and moved into the building trade as a contractor in his own right. In 1875, he built the original St John's Presbyterian Church in Bungendore and, in 1876\u201378, rebuilt the spire of St John's Church in Canberra. A string of government contracts soon followed. He constructed additions to the Queanbeyan Court House and Gaol in 1877 and 1878 respectively, and erected the Bungendore Public School in 1879, the Queanbeyan Post Office in 1879\u201380, the [[Gundaroo]] Court House in 1882-83 and the [[Sutton, New South Wales|Sutton]] Public School in 1882\u201383.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nTo enhance his business and the quality of his work, Kealman had established an imported brickmaking machine on the Garryowen Estate in Queanbeyan in 1879. This enterprise, the first of its kind in southern NSW, produced 4,000 high-quality bricks per day. Kealman would have used these bricks in the construction of the manse.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-35>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 18 June 1879:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 9 August 1879:2</ref>\n\nIt was distinctly in Kealman's favour, too - and a reassurance to the Manse Building Committee - that Barnet was familiar with and approved of his work. During a visit to Queanbeyan in October 1881, Barnet had carried out a careful inspection of the construction of further additions to the Court House, for which Kealman was the contractor. On completing the inspection, Barnet expressed complete satisfaction with the standard of workmanship.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-36>''[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]'', 13 October 1881:4</ref> Indeed, Barnet probably had previous acquaintance with Kealman's work. Kealman had erected the Queanbeyan Police Barracks or Police Sergeant's Residence, now the Queanbeyan Historical Museum, in 1875-76 and the town's Post Office in 1879\u201380, both of which Barnet may have designed or at least would have been closely associated with.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nKealman signed the contract to build the manse in January 1883 after \"certain deviations from the plans\" had been agreed upon.<ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 27 March 1883:2</ref> It is likely that the purpose of these \"deviations\" was to lower costs. One such deviation may have comprised the laying of Kealman's bricks in colonial bond on the less visible western side and rear of the building, in contrast to the use of English bond on the front and eastern sides. This strategy would have reduced the number of bricks and hence the cost of the construction.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe work of construction commenced in February 1883 and proceeded rapidly. The foundation stone of the building was laid at a ceremony on 22 March 1883 and, in May, work had advanced to the point where Kealman was able to roof in both the main building and the kitchen attachment. But a shortage of funds threatened the completion of work. At the end of June, the Building Committee remained 200 pounds shy of the figure required. Steel, thereupon, decided to launch an appeal for funds from the wider Presbyterian community. Through weekly advertisement in ''The Presbyterian and Australian Witness'', he entreated Presbyterians in Sydney and other parts of the colony to make gifts of work or money so that a fund-raising \"Sale of Work\" could be held in late September. The appeal was evidently successful. The manse was completed in November, enabling Steel and his family to take up residence from their temporary refuge in Bungendore.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=\"PAW18830331\"/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-37/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-38>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 6 February 1883:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 8 May 1883:2</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 30 June 1883:5-6</ref><ref>''[[Queanbeyan Age]]'', 3 November 1883:5</ref><ref>''[[Goulburn Herald]]'', 29 November 1883:2</ref>\n\nA photograph dating from {{circa|1886}} shows the manse just a few years after its completion. Apart from the white picket fence which had been replaced by a brick fence, the front aspect of the building is unchanged. The roofline, chimneys, bay window, verandah, unrendered brickwork, awning over the windows on the eastern side and even the bargeboards remain today exactly as they were when the manse was erected. The interior of the building also remains largely intact. It retains original fireplaces, architraves, some pressed metal ceilings, and mantelpieces donated by Hudson Brothers Timber Merchants of Sydney in 1883.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=\"PAW18830331\"/>\n\nWhile the original roof has been replaced by a new CGI roof, the principal change to the manse has been the building of an extension onto the eastern side of the structure at its rear. Now largely hidden by shrubs, the extension was built to match the original brickwork and window details. It may have been erected in the late 1880s or early 1890s, perhaps by Kealman, to accommodate the Steels' growing family. They eventually had seven children.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nAlthough as a private dwelling the manse is a departure from government buildings that Barnet designed, in some degree it resembles some of the smaller official structure that either he personally or the Colonial Architect's Office designed in the \"house style\" he had established. These structures included police barracks and quarters for staff of lighthouses. Nevertheless, where these buildings embody the sober and solemn quality that Barnet intended for official structures, the manse exhibits a rather more homely, genial and welcoming character while still retaining an air of dignity and respectability. This Barnet achieved without resorting to the use of Picturesque and other new-fangled architectural ornamentation to which, by temperament and professional inclination, he was in any case vehemently opposed.<ref name=nswshr-2018/><ref name=nswshr-2018-2018-40/>{{rp|13, 51\u201352, 54\u201355}}\n\n== Description ==\n===St Stephen's Church===\nA small rural Gothic Revival church with some English features. Built of stone with a steeply-pitched corrogated iron roof (originally shingles). The exterior walls have buttressess which serve no structural function, but were built as an ornamental feature. Rising from the southwestern corner of the building is a low bell tower. It is surmounted by a [[spire]] that was constructed in 1956 after the original one was blown down and destoyed in high winds.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe church is a rectangular building orientated southeast\u2013northwest. It has a four-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] nave, a [[porch]] on its front end, and a vestry or session room at its rear. There are ten lancet windows in the body of the church with two smaller examples in the porch and one in the vestry. The window and door frames are of oak. The window label moulds feature bosses with foliage motifs and the door label moulds feature bosses that are composed of the heads of Grecian figures. Behind the pulpit in the northern end of the nave is a large circular [[quatrefoil]] window that was installed in 1896. The nave has a barrel ceiling lined with varninshed [[Tongue and groove|tongue-and-groove]] pine boards.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n===Manse===\nA single-storey brick cottage with attached kitchen and servant's room. It has a [[Hipped roof|hipped]] and gabled roof sheathed in [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]], which is not the original covering. There are two multi-[[corbel]] [[chimneys]], decorative barge boards and a [[finial]], and a front [[veranda]]h with a [[skillion roof]] supported by slender timber [[columns]] with decorative timber [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. The front of the cottage features a large rectangular [[bay window]]. The cottage brick work is laid in Colonial bond on the less visible western side and rear of the building. On the front and eastern side the bricks are laid in [[Brickwork|English bond]]. The interior retains original details, such as fireplaces, [[architraves]], some [[pressed metal ceiling]]s and mantel pieces. However, the fireplaces have been boarded up to prevent drafts in the recent past.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 3 July 2019, the church is in excellent condition. However, it does require some maintenance works on its interior [[lighting]] and electrical system and to its structural walls to stop water penetration though the stonework.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe manse is in reasonable condition, but has not been lived in for some time. It has recently undergone maintenance works funded by Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council to restore its exterior. This included restoration work on its bay window.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe Manse was extended on its rear side in the late 1880s ot early 1890s in a sympathetic manner. A further extension was undertaken on its northern side potentially in the 1990s.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 2 August 2017, St Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse are of state significance as a small, intact and harmonious ecclesiastical precinct.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe small rural gothic revival church is of state significance for its historic, associative, aesthetic, rarity, and representative values. It is the only non-Anglican church designed by Reverend Alberto Dias Soares, Honorary Diocesan Architect of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn between 1863 and 1888. He is one of only two cleric-architects known to have practiced in Australia and the only one to have worked in NSW. During his career Soares designed 31 known buildings across southern NSW, mainly churches and parsonages, and today 26 are extant. He is responsible for populating much of southern NSW with aesthetical pleasing and ecclesiastical appropriate architecture for the Anglican Church throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. This church is also noteworthy as an attractive, well-designed and constructed example of the kind of modest Presbyterian churches built in country areas of NSW during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nThe Manse is of state significance for its associative, aesthetic, rarity, and representative values. It is the only extant private domestic building of the three designed by James Barnet, NSW Colonial Architect (1865-1890), during his long architectural career. Barnet designed the manse for his eldest daughter Amy Steel and her family. Amy's husband Robert Steel was minister at St Stephen's for almost seventeen years between 1881 and 1897. This building displays a different side of Barnet's architectural character in comparison to his vast portfolio of government work. While resembling the smaller official structures he designed it has a more homely and welcoming character that retains an air of dignity and respectability appropriate for a Presbyterian minister. Overall, this Manse displays two often overlooked parts of Barnet's character: his strong family devotion and religious conviction.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church and Manse was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 May 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state historic significance as it was designed by the only cleric-architect known to have practiced in NSW, Reverend Alberto Dias Soares, Honorary Diocesan Architect of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn between 1863 and 1888. There has only been one other cleric-architect who worked in Australia, Monsignor John Hawes, who lived and worked in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state significance for its strong association with the cleric-architect Reverend Alberto Dias Soares (1830-1909). He is the only cleric-architect to have operated in NSW and during his architectural career between roughly 1859 and 1877 he designed and built 31 buildings, mostly churches and parsonages. These were mostly in the Diocese of Goulburn, for which he was Honorary Diocesan Architect between 1863 and 1888. However, at this time this diocese spread across southern NSW all the way to Wentworth. Among these items this church is special, as it was the only non-Anglican ecclesiastical structure he designed. Despite this being an act of kindness on his behalf, he earned the censure of his superiors for assisting the Anglican church's rivals.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse is of state significance for its strong association with James Barnet (1827-1904), NSW Colonial Architect between 1865 and 1890. During his long career he designed and built a large range of government buildings. However, outside of this office he is known to have designed only three private domestic buildings of which this manse is the only extant example. Barnett designed the building for his eldest daughter Amy Steel (1857-1897) and her family. Her husband, Reverend Robert Alexander Steel (1854-1916), was the minister of St Stephen's between 1881 and 1897.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state aesthetic significance as it exhibits some noteworthy aesthetic characteristics of the gothic revival style in small rural churches. Specifically, the quality masonry work, lancet windows, label moulds adorned with bosses over the windows and doors, and circular stained-glass window. An unusual creative innovation in the design and construction of the church is the clever use of diagonal buttresses to support the corner belfry.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse is of state aesthetic significance as it displays aesthetic characteristics of a high order for a domestic structure that is of relatively modest scale. The unaltered characteristics since construction include the hipped and gabled roof, multi-corbel chimneys, decorative barge boards, finial, bay window and skillion-roofed front verandah supported by timber posts with ornate timber brackets. These various elements combine in a harmonious and well-proportioned whole.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is rare in a state context as the only non-Anglican church designed by the cleric-architect, Reverend Alberto Dias Soares, Honorary Diocesan Architect of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn between 1863 and 1888.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse is rare in a state context as the only extant private domestic building of the three designed by James Barnett, NSW Colonial Architect (1864-1890), throughout his long architectural career.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Church is of state representative significance as a fine intact example of the kind of modest Presbyterian churches built in country areas of NSW in the nineteenth century. It reflects the fashionable gothic revival design of these churches, as well as solid, high standard of construction in stone.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\nSt Stephen's Presbyterian Manse has state representative significance as a fine and intact example of a nineteenth century clergyman's residence considering it was designed by such a distinguished architect. Furthermore, it is representative of Barnet's work in the private domain, displaying his abilities is a sphere outside the government structures he usually designed.<ref name=nswshr-2018/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New South Wales|Christianity|Calvinism}}\n* [[Australian non-residential architectural styles]]\n* [[List of Presbyterian and Reformed denominations in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Armour|first=Jan|date=1974|title=And this Stone: The story of St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Queanbeyan}}\n* {{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Graeme|date=2016|title=God's Architect, The churches and parsonages of Alberto Soares}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Bridges, Peter |author2=McDonald, Don|date=1988|title=James Barnet Colonial Architect}}\n* {{cite book|last=Charlton|first=Ken|date=1998|title=Southern Spires}}\n* {{cite book|author=Cross, Rex L.|date=1985|title=Bygone Queanbeyan |edition=Revised}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Cross, Rex L. |author2=Sheedy, Bert|date=1983|title=Queanbeyan Pioneers - First Study}}\n* {{cite web|last=Evans|first=A.

The smaller sized variant is called '''provola''' {{IPA-it|\u02c8pr\u0254\u02d0vola|}} and comes in plain and [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]] (''affumicata'') varieties.\n\nModern provolone is a full-fat cow's milk cheese with a smooth skin, produced mainly in the [[Po River]] Valley regions of [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]]. It is produced in different shapes: like a very large sausage which may be up to {{convert|30|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|90|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} long,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012|reason=30 dia * 90 long is over 60l, must weigh over 60kg - may be true, but needs ref}} in a truncated bottle shape, and in a large pear shape with the characteristic round knob for hanging. The typical weight is {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nProvolone is a semi-hard cheese with taste varying greatly from ''provolone piccante'' (sharp, piquant), aged for a minimum of four months and with a very sharp taste, to ''provolone dolce'' (sweet) with a very mild taste. In ''provolone piccante'', the distinctive piquant taste is produced with [[lipase]] (enzyme) derived from goat. The ''dolce'' version uses calf's lipase instead.\n\nBoth ''provolone valpadana'' and ''provolone del Monaco ''(from the [[Naples]] area of Italy) have received the DOP ([[Protected Designation of Origin]]) seal from the European Union, meaning no country other than Italy may legally produce a cheese called that.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Uruguay]], small discs of locally produced [[Pasta filata|pulled-curd]] provolone of {{convert|10|to|15|cm|abbr=on|0}} in diameter and {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} in height are sometimes grilled until partially melted and eaten as a starter, often seasoned with herbs. The cheese when served this way is often called ''[[provoleta]]'' in Spanish.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[List of cheeses]]\n* [[List of stretch-curd cheeses]]\n* [[Pizza cheese]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Italian cheeses}}\n\n[[Category:Italian cheeses]]\n[[Category:Cow's-milk cheeses]]\n[[Category:Italian products with protected designation of origin]]\n[[Category:Cheeses with designation of origin protected in the European Union]]\n[[Category:Smoked cheeses]]\n[[Category:Stretched-curd cheeses]]\n", "name_user": "HeClearlyLikesIt", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory and varieties)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provolone"}

The Mahdi will bring back worship of true Islamic values, and bring the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to light. He will conquer [[Istanbul]] and [[Gilan Province|Mount Daylam]] and will regard Jerusalem and the Dome as his home. His banner will be that of the prophet Muhammad: black and unstitched, with a halo. Furled since the death of Muhammad, the banner will unfurl when the Mahdi appears.

Historically, Sunni Islam considers religious authority as being derived from the caliph, who was appointed by the companions of Muhammad at his death and the [[sahaba|companions of Muhammad]]. The Sunnis view the Mahdi as the successor of Mohammad; the Mahdi is expected to arrive to rule the world and reestablish righteousness.<ref name=\"Arjomand 20072\">{{cite journal|last=Arjomand|first=Said Amir|date=Dec 2007|title=Islam in Iran vi., the Concept of Mahdi in Sunni Islam|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vi-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-sunni-islam|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=XIV|issue=Fasc. 2|pages=134\u2013136}}</ref> Some Sunnis share a belief that there may be no actual Mahdi, but that a series of mujaddid will instead lead to an Islamic revolution of a renewal of faith and avoidance of deviation from God's path. Sunni tradition has attributed such intellectual and spiritual attributes to numerous Muslims at the end of each Muslim century from the origin of Islam to the present day.<ref name=\"Waldman\"/> This classical interpretation is favored by Sunni scholars like [[Ghazali]].{{Citation needed|reason=How can we know, which was a favorite interpretation or which scholars represents the classical opinnion without scholars, who analized it?|date=February 2019}}\n\nContrarily, Shi'a Islam vested religious authority in those of the bloodline of Muhammad, favoring his cousin and son by marriage, Ali. Ali was appointed the first Imam; and according to [[Twelver]] interpretation, he was followed by eleven more. [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], otherwise known as the Twelfth Imam, went into hiding in 873 at the age of four. His father was [[Hasan al-Askari|al-`Askari]], who had been murdered; and so he was hidden from the authorities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He maintained contact with his followers until 940, when he entered [[the Occultation]]. Twelverism believes that al-Mahdi is the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|current Imam]], and will emerge at the end of the current age. Some scholars say that, although unnoticed by others present, the Mahdi of Twelver Islam continues to make an annual pilgrimage while he resides outside of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0223?_hi=0&_pos=1#TheMahd|title=Eschatology|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|work=Oxford Islamic Studies|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islamic Studies (subscription required).}}</ref>  In contradistinction, Sunni Islam foresees him as a separate and new person.<ref name=\"Red2\">{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00605KLP8/ref=docs-os-doi_0|title=Islam and the Last days|last=Rogers|first=Ed|date=26 Oct 2011|publisher=Connection Publishing}}</ref> The present Ayatollahs of Iran see themselves as joint caretakers of the office of the Imam until he returns.<ref>{{cite book|title=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|publisher=Random House|year=2006|isbn=1-4000-6213-6|location=New York|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title-link=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi is not described in the Qur\u02be\u0101n, only in hadith, with scholars suggesting he arose when Arabian tribes were settling in Syria under Muawiya. \"They anticipated 'the Mahdi who will lead the rising people of the Yemen back to their country' in order to restore the glory of their lost Himyarite kingdom.

It is directed to the individual and \"the basis of faith and deeds,\" not gender. This is consistent in the Qur'an.

Historically, Sunni Islam considers religious authority as being derived from the caliph, who was appointed by the companions of Muhammad at his death and the [[sahaba|companions of Muhammad]]. The Sunnis view the Mahdi as the successor of Mohammad; the Mahdi is expected to arrive to rule the world and reestablish righteousness.<ref name=\"Arjomand 20072\">{{cite journal|last=Arjomand|first=Said Amir|date=Dec 2007|title=Islam in Iran vi., the Concept of Mahdi in Sunni Islam|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vi-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-sunni-islam|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=XIV|issue=Fasc. 2|pages=134\u2013136}}</ref> Some Sunnis share a belief that there may be no actual Mahdi, but that a series of mujaddid will instead lead to an Islamic revolution of a renewal of faith and avoidance of deviation from God's path. Sunni tradition has attributed such intellectual and spiritual attributes to numerous Muslims at the end of each Muslim century from the origin of Islam to the present day.<ref name=\"Waldman\"/> This classical interpretation is favored by Sunni scholars like [[Ghazali]].{{Citation needed|reason=How can we know, which was a favorite interpretation or which scholars represents the classical opinnion without scholars, who analized it?|date=February 2019}}\n\nContrarily, Shi'a Islam vested religious authority in those of the bloodline of Muhammad, favoring his cousin and son by marriage, Ali. Ali was appointed the first Imam; and according to [[Twelver]] interpretation, he was followed by eleven more. [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], otherwise known as the Twelfth Imam, went into hiding in 873 at the age of four. His father was [[Hasan al-Askari|al-`Askari]], who had been murdered; and so he was hidden from the authorities of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He maintained contact with his followers until 940, when he entered [[the Occultation]]. Twelverism believes that al-Mahdi is the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|current Imam]], and will emerge at the end of the current age. Some scholars say that, although unnoticed by others present, the Mahdi of Twelver Islam continues to make an annual pilgrimage while he resides outside of Mecca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0223?_hi=0&_pos=1#TheMahd|title=Eschatology|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|work=Oxford Islamic Studies|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islamic Studies (subscription required).}}</ref>  In contradistinction, Sunni Islam foresees him as a separate and new person.<ref name=\"Red2\">{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00605KLP8/ref=docs-os-doi_0|title=Islam and the Last days|last=Rogers|first=Ed|date=26 Oct 2011|publisher=Connection Publishing}}</ref> The present Ayatollahs of Iran see themselves as joint caretakers of the office of the Imam until he returns.<ref>{{cite book|title=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|publisher=Random House|year=2006|isbn=1-4000-6213-6|location=New York|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title-link=No god but Allah : the origins, evolution, and future of Islam}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi is not described in the Qur\u02be\u0101n, only in hadith, with scholars suggesting he arose when Arabian tribes were settling in Syria under Muawiya. \"They anticipated 'the Mahdi who will lead the rising people of the Yemen back to their country' in order to restore the glory of their lost Himyarite kingdom.

In a sense, these levels of Hell were interpreted to have a similar function as Purgatory in Christianity, with the exception to this comparison being that Hell in this context is for the punishment of the sinner's complete body, as opposed to the only the soul being punished in Purgatory.<ref name=\":22\" /> Arguments questioning the permanence of Hell take the view that Hell is not necessarily solely there to punish the evil, but to purify their souls. To clarify, the Garden is the reward while the Fire is for purification.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Islamic understanding of death and resurrection|last=Smith, Jane I.|date=1981|publisher=State University of New York Press|others=Haddad, Yvonne Yazbeck, 1935-|isbn=0873955064|location=Albany|pages=94|oclc=6666779}}</ref>\n\n== Gender and Islamic Eschatology ==\nEschatological beliefs in Islam do not tend to distinguish the afterlife on the basis of gender. Amina Wadud discusses Hell and Paradise in her book \"Qur'an and Woman\" very briefly. Wadud mentions that the Qur'an does not mention any specific gender when talking about Hell. All genders have an equal chance and consequence to experience hell and one is not over the other. The Qur'an 43:74-76 states that \"the guilty are immortal in hell's torment,\" not he or she. It is directed to the individual and \"the basis of faith and deeds,\" not gender. This is consistent in the Qur'an. Amina Wadud goes on to discuss paradise, and how the Qur'an describes it with such detail in order to \"entice\" the readers and make it sound pleasing. Wadud states what the Qur'an says about good earthly things, and eternal things which includes women. 3:14-15 states \"Beautiful of mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and offspring...\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=Qur\u02bcan and woman : rereading the sacred text from a woman's perspective|last=Wadud, Amina|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198029434|edition= [2nd ed.]|location=New York|oclc=252662926}}</ref><ref>Qur\u02bcan and woman : rereading the sacred text from a woman's perspective ([2nd.] ed.).

Many of his descendants, and other First Nations citizens, live on the nearby Reserve of [[Six Nations of the Grand River]], 20 kilometers from Brantford; it is the most populous reserve in Canada. Brantford is known as the \"Telephone City\" as the city's famous resident, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], invented the first [[telephone]] at his father's homestead, Melville House, now the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Brant by Gilbert Stuart, 1786.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant, Mohawk military and political leader]]\nThe Iroquoian-speaking Attawandaron, known in English as the [[Neutral Nation]], lived in the Grand River valley area before the 17th century; their main village and seat of the chief, [[Kandoucho]], was identified by 19th-century historians as having been located on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] where present-day Brantford developed. This community, like the rest of their settlements, was destroyed when the Iroquois declared war in 1650 over the fur trade and exterminated the Neutral nation.<ref>Reville, F. Douglas.

As a reward for their loyalty to the [[British Crown]], they were given a large land grant, referred to as the [[Haldimand Proclamation|Haldimand Tract]], on the Grand River. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day city at a location favourable for landing canoes. Brant's crossing (or fording) of the river gave the original name to the area: '''Brant's ford'''.\n\nThe area began to grow from a small settlement in the 1820s as the Hamilton and London Road was improved.

Brantford developed as an important Canadian industrial centre for the first half of the 20th century, and it was once the third-ranked Canadian city in terms of cash-value of manufactured goods exported.\n\nThe city developed at the deepest navigable point of the Grand River. Because of existing networks, it became a railroad hub of Southern Ontario. The combination of water and rail helped Brantford develop from a farming community into an industrial city with many blue-collar jobs, based on the agriculture implement industry. Major companies included S.C. Johnson Wax, Massey-Harris, Verity Plow, and the [[Cockshutt Plow Company]]. This industry, more than any other, provided the well-paying and steady employment that allowed Brantford to sustain economic growth through most of the 20th century.\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of Brantford was in steady decline due to changes in heavy industry and its restructuring. Numerous companies suffered bankruptcies, such as [[White Farm Equipment]], [[Massey-Ferguson]] (and its successor, Massey Combines Corporation), Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and other manufacturers. The bankruptcies and closures of the businesses left thousands of people unemployed and created one of the most economically depressed areas in the country, and had a particular impact on the once vibrant downtown.\n\nAn economic revival was prompted by the completion of the Brantford-to-[[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]] section of [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway 403]] in 1997, bringing companies easy access to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Toronto]] and completing a direct route from [[Detroit]] to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. In 2004 [[Procter & Gamble]] and [[Ferrero SpA]] chose to locate in the city. Though Wescast Industries, Inc. recently closed their local foundry, their corporate headquarters will remain in Brantford. [[S. C. Johnson & Son|SC Johnson]] Canada has their headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Brantford, connected to the Canadian National network. Other companies that have their headquarters here include [[Gunther Mele]] and [[GreenMantra Technologies]]. On February 16, 2005, Brant, including Brantford, was added to the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] along with [[Haldimand]] and [[Northumberland County, Ontario|Northumberland]] counties.\n\nIn February 2019, Brantford's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% \u2013 lower than Ontario's rate of 5.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=2820135&&pattern&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid|title=CANSIM -

Many of his descendants, and other First Nations citizens, live on the nearby Reserve of [[Six Nations of the Grand River]], 20 kilometers from Brantford; it is the most populous reserve in Canada. Brantford is known as the \"Telephone City\" as the city's famous resident, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], invented the first [[telephone]] at his father's homestead, Melville House, now the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Joseph Brant by Gilbert Stuart, 1786.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant, Mohawk military and political leader]]\nThe Iroquoian-speaking Attawandaron, known in English as the [[Neutral Nation]], lived in the Grand River valley area before the 17th century; their main village and seat of the chief, [[Kandoucho]], was identified by 19th-century historians as having been located on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] where present-day Brantford developed. This community, like the rest of their settlements, was destroyed when the Iroquois declared war in 1650 over the fur trade and exterminated the Neutral nation.<ref>Reville, F. Douglas.

As a reward for their loyalty to the [[British Crown]], they were given a large land grant, referred to as the [[Haldimand Proclamation|Haldimand Tract]], on the Grand River. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day city at a location favourable for landing canoes. Brant's crossing (or fording) of the river gave the original name to the area: '''Brant's ford'''.\n\nThe area began to grow from a small settlement in the 1820s as the Hamilton and London Road was improved. By the 1830's, Brantford became a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], and a sizable number of [[Black Canadians|runaway African-Americans]] settled in the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=- Grand River Branch - United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada |url=http://www.grandriveruel.ca/Newsletter_Reprints/99v11n1African_Canadian.htm |website=www.grandriveruel.ca |accessdate=11 February 2019}}</ref> From the 1830's to the 1860's - several hundred people of African descent settled in the area around Murray Street, and in Cainsville.

The decision was widely criticized by Ontario's heritage preservation community, however the city argued it was needed for downtown renewal.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blaze Carlson|first=Katherine|title=Ontario city to demolish historic street, despite Ottawa's objection|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/08/ontario-city-seeks-to-demolish-historic-street-despite-ottawa's-objection/|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=National Post|date=June 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkes|first=Jim|title=Demolition of historic buildings begins in Brantford|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/820483--demolition-of-historic-buildings-begins-in-brantford|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=June 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Historic plaques and memorials ===\nPlaques and monuments erected by the provincial and federal governments provide additional glimpses into the early history of the area around Brantford.<ref name=\"waynecook.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waynecook.com/abrant.html|title=Historical Plaques of Brant County|website=Waynecook.com}}</ref>\n\nThe famed Mohawk Chief [[Joseph Brant]] (Thayendanega) led his people from the Mohawk Valley of New York State to Upper Canada after being allied with the British during the [[American Revolution]] where they lost their land holdings.

As of October 22, 2018, the mayor is Kevin Davis.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe [[invention of the telephone|electric telephone was invented here]], leading to the establishment of Canada's first telephone factory here in the 1870s. Brantford developed as an important Canadian industrial centre for the first half of the 20th century, and it was once the third-ranked Canadian city in terms of cash-value of manufactured goods exported.\n\nThe city developed at the deepest navigable point of the Grand River. Because of existing networks, it became a railroad hub of Southern Ontario. The combination of water and rail helped Brantford develop from a farming community into an industrial city with many blue-collar jobs, based on the agriculture implement industry. Major companies included S.C. Johnson Wax, Massey-Harris, Verity Plow, and the [[Cockshutt Plow Company]]. This industry, more than any other, provided the well-paying and steady employment that allowed Brantford to sustain economic growth through most of the 20th century.\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, the economy of Brantford was in steady decline due to changes in heavy industry and its restructuring. Numerous companies suffered bankruptcies, such as [[White Farm Equipment]], [[Massey-Ferguson]] (and its successor, Massey Combines Corporation), Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and other manufacturers. The bankruptcies and closures of the businesses left thousands of people unemployed and created one of the most economically depressed areas in the country, and had a particular impact on the once vibrant downtown.\n\nAn economic revival was prompted by the completion of the Brantford-to-[[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]] section of [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway 403]] in 1997, bringing companies easy access to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Toronto]] and completing a direct route from [[Detroit]] to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. In 2004 [[Procter & Gamble]] and [[Ferrero SpA]] chose to locate in the city. Though Wescast Industries, Inc. recently closed their local foundry, their corporate headquarters will remain in Brantford. [[S. C. Johnson & Son|SC Johnson]] Canada has their headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Brantford, connected to the Canadian National network. Other companies that have their headquarters here include [[Gunther Mele]] and [[GreenMantra Technologies]]. On February 16, 2005, Brant, including Brantford, was added to the Greater [[Golden Horseshoe]] along with [[Haldimand]] and [[Northumberland County, Ontario|Northumberland]] counties.\n\nIn February 2019, Brantford's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% \u2013 lower than Ontario's rate of 5.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=2820135&&pattern&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid|title=CANSIM -
