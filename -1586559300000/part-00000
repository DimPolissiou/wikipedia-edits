Simon]] formulated one of the first models of heuristics, known as [[satisficing]]. His more general research program posed the question of how humans make decisions when the conditions for [[rational choice theory]] are not met, that is how people decide under uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|date=1989|title=The Scientist as Problem Solver.|journal=|location=Fort Belvoir, VA|volume=|pages=|doi=10.21236/ada240569}}</ref> Simon is also known as the father of [[bounded rationality]], which he understood as the study of the match (or mismatch) between heuristics and decision environments. This program was later extended into the study of [[ecological rationality]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] took a different approach, linking heuristics to cognitive biases. Their typical experimental setup consisted of a rule of logic or probability, embedded in a verbal description of a judgement problem, and demonstrated that people's intuitive judgement deviated from the rule. The \"Linda problem\" below gives an example. The deviation is then explained by a heuristic. This research, called the heuristics-and-biases program, challenged the idea that human beings are rational actors and first gained worldwide attention in 1974 with the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper \"[[#CITEREFTverskyKahneman1974|Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]]\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|date=1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124\u20131131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T}}</ref>  and although the originally proposed heuristics have been challenged in the further debate,<ref name=\"Gigerenzer1996\">{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=G.|year=1996|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592\u2013596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}</ref> this research program has changed the field by permanently setting the research questions.<ref name=\"FiedlerSydow2015\">{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology: Revising the Classical Studies|last1=Fiedler|first1=Klaus|last2=von Sydow|first2=Momme|date=2015|publisher=Sage, London|isbn=978-1-4462-9447-5|editor-last1=Eysenck|editor-first1=Michael W.|pages=146\u2013161|chapter=Heuristics and Biases: Beyond Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) Judgment under Uncertainty|editor-last2=Groome|editor-first2=David|chapterurl=http://crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de/sites/default/files/vonSydow/Fiedler__von_Sydow_2015_Heuristic_and_biases_Beyond_Tversky__Kahneman_s_1974_In__Eysenck_Groome_Ch_12.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe original ideas by Herbert Simon were taken up in the 1990s by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others.

If one has heard of Roddick but not of Robredo, the recognition heuristic leads to the prediction that Roddick will win. The recognition heuristic exploits partial ignorance, if one has heard of both or no player, a different strategy is needed.

It is called a \u201ctree\u201d because it can be represented like a decision tree in which one asks a sequence of questions. Unlike a full decision tree, however, it is an incomplete tree \u2013 to save time and reduce the danger of overfitting.\n\nFigure 1 shows a fast-and-frugal tree used for screening for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Just like take-the-best, the tree has a search rule, stopping rule, and decision rule:\n\n''Search rule'': Search through cues in a specified order.\n''Stopping rule'': Stop search if an exit is reached.\n''Decision rule'': Classify the person according to the exit (here: No HIV or HIV).\n\nIn the HIV tree, an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test is conducted first. If the outcome is negative, then the testing procedure stops and the client is informed of the good news, that is, \u201cno HIV.\u201d If, however, the result is positive, a second ELISA test is performed, preferably from a different manufacturer. If the second ELISA is negative, then the procedure stops and the client is informed of having \u201cno HIV.\u201d However, if the result is positive, a final test, the Western blot, is conducted.\n\n[[File:Fast-and-frugal-p1.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: Screening for HIV in the general public follows the logic of a fast-and-frugal tree. If the first enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d If not, a second ELISA is performed; if it is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d Otherwise, a Western blot test is performed, which determines the final classification]]\n\nIn general, for n binary cues, a fast-and-frugal tree has exactly n + 1 exits \u2013 one for each cue and two for the final cue. A full decision tree, in contrast, requires 2<sup>n</sup> exits. The order of cues (tests) in a fast-and-frugal tree is determined by the sensitivity and specificity of the cues, or by other considerations such as the costs of the tests. In the case of the HIV tree, the ELISA is ranked first because it produces fewer misses than the Western blot test, and also is less expensive. The Western blot test, in contrast, produces fewer false alarms. In a full tree, in contrast, order does not matter for the accuracy of the classifications.\n\nFast-and-frugal trees are descriptive or prescriptive models of decision making under uncertainty. For instance, an analysis or court decisions reported that the best model of how London magistrates make bail decisions is a fast and frugal tree.<ref>{{Citation|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.01438|pmid=12661681|title=Psychological Models of Professional Decision Making|journal=Psychological Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=175\u2013180|year=2003|last1=Dhami|first1=Mandeep K.}}</ref> The HIV tree is both prescriptive\u2013 physicians are taught the procedure \u2013 and a descriptive model, that is, most physicians actually follow the procedure.\n\n==Informal models of heuristics==\n\nIn their initial research, Tversky and Kahneman proposed three heuristics\u2014availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Subsequent work has identified many more. Heuristics that underlie judgment are called \"judgment heuristics\". Another type, called \"evaluation heuristics\", are used to judge the desirability of possible choices.<ref>{{harvnb| Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=210\u2013211}}</ref>\n\n===Availability===\n{{main|Availability heuristic}}\nIn psychology, ''availability'' is the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic.<ref name=\"tkavail\">{{Citation|last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2= Kahneman |first2=Daniel |year=1973 |title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}</ref> When an infrequent event can be brought easily and vividly to mind, this heuristic overestimates its likelihood. For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a [[tornado]] or [[terrorism]]. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.<ref name=\"suther_avail\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=16\u201317}}</ref> On the other hand, common but mundane events are hard to bring to mind, so their likelihoods tend to be underestimated. These include deaths from [[suicide]]s, [[stroke]]s, and [[diabetes]]. This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.<ref name=\"plous_avail\" /> It may also play a role in the appeal of [[Lottery|lotteries]]: to someone buying a ticket, the well-publicised, jubilant winners are more available than the millions of people who have won nothing.<ref name=\"suther_avail\" />\n\nWhen people judge whether more [[English language|English]] words begin with ''T'' or with ''K'' ,  the availability heuristic gives a quick way to answer the question. Words that begin with ''T'' come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with ''K'' in the first position or with ''K'' in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with ''K'', such as ''kangaroo'', ''kitchen'', or ''kept''. It is harder to think of words with ''K'' as the third letter, such as ''lake'', or ''acknowledge'', although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that ''K'' is more common at the start of words.<ref name=\"tk1974\" >{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}</ref> In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.<ref name=\"tkavail\" />\n\nIn one experiment that occurred before the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. Presidential election]], some participants were asked to imagine [[Gerald Ford]] winning, while others did the same for a [[Jimmy Carter]] victory. Each group subsequently viewed their allocated candidate as significantly more likely to win. The researchers found a similar effect when students imagined a good or a bad season for a [[college football]] team.<ref name=\"Carroll1978\">{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=J.|title=The Effect of Imagining an Event on Expectations for the Event: An Interpretation in Terms of the Availability Heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88\u201396|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}</ref> The effect of imagination on subjective likelihood has been replicated by several other researchers.<ref name=\"plous_avail\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nA concept's availability can be affected by how recently and how frequently it has been brought to mind. In one study, subjects were given partial sentences to complete. The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]''. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect. A greater interval between the initial task and the judgment decreased the effect.<ref name=\"SrullWyer1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Srull|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Wyer|first2=Robert S.|title=The Role of Category Accessibility in the Interpretation of Information About Persons: Some Determinants and Implications|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=10|year=1979|pages=1660\u20131672|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1660|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.4255}}</ref>\n\nTversky and Kahneman offered the availability heuristic as an explanation for [[illusory correlation]]s in which people wrongly judge two events to be associated with each other. They explained that people judge correlation on the basis of the ease of imagining or recalling the two events together.<ref name=\"tkavail\" /><ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\n===Representativeness===\n{{main|Representativeness heuristic}}\n[[File:Generalization_process_using_trees_PNG_version.png|alt=Diagram|right|thumb|243x243px|Snap judgement of whether novel object fits an existing category]]\nThe representativeness heuristic is seen when people use categories, for example when deciding whether or not a person is a criminal. An individual thing has a high ''representativeness'' for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of representativeness, they are using the representativeness heuristic. \"Representative\" is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and representativeness is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref name=\"plous_repres\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=109\u2013120}}</ref> While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the ''base rates''). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the [[base rate fallacy]]. Representativeness explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.<ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\nThe representativeness heuristic is also an explanation of how people judge cause and effect: when they make these judgements on the basis of similarity, they are also said to be using the representativeness heuristic. This can lead to a bias, incorrectly finding causal relationships between things that resemble one another and missing them when the cause and effect are very different. Examples of this include both the belief that \"emotionally relevant events ought to have emotionally relevant causes\", and magical [[associative thinking]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Richard E.|last1= Nisbett |last2= Ross|first2=Lee|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|url=https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=9780134450735|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb/page/115 115\u2013118]}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|title=Like Goes with Like: The Role of Representativeness in Erroneous and Pseudo-Scientific Beliefs|date=2002-07-08|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511808098A046/type/book_part|work=Heuristics and Biases|pages=617\u2013624|editor-last=Gilovich|editor-first=Thomas|edition=1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511808098.036.|isbn=978-0-521-79260-8|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Savitsky|first2=Kenneth|editor2-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Dale|editor3-last=Kahneman|editor3-first=Daniel}}</ref>\n\n====of base rates====\n{{main|Base rate fallacy}}\nA 1973 experiment used a psychological profile of Tom W., a fictional graduate student.<ref name=\"ktprediction\">{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Amos Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237\u2013251 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}</ref> One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (including Law, Engineering and Library Science). Another group had to rate how likely it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e. the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). If people based their judgments on probability, they would say that Tom is more likely to study Humanities than Library Science, because there are many more Humanities students, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.<ref name=\"ktprediction\" />\n\n====Conjunction fallacy====\n{{main|Conjunction fallacy}}\nWhen people rely on representativeness, they can fall into an error which breaks a fundamental law of [[probability]].<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /> Tversky and Kahneman gave subjects a short character sketch of a woman called Linda, describing her as, \"31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations\". People reading this description then ranked the likelihood of different statements about Linda. Amongst others, these included \"Linda is a bank teller\", and, \"Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\". People showed a strong tendency to rate the latter, more specific statement as more likely, even though a conjunction of the form \"Linda is both ''X'' and ''Y''\" can never be more probable than the more general statement \"Linda is ''X''\". The explanation in terms of heuristics is that the judgment was distorted because, for the readers, the character sketch was representative of the sort of person who might be an active feminist but not of someone who works in a bank. A similar exercise concerned Bill, described as \"intelligent but unimaginative\". A great majority of people reading this character sketch rated \"Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby\", as more likely than \"Bill plays jazz for a hobby\".<ref name=\"tkconjunction\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293\u2013315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293}}  reprinted in {{Citation |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=19\u201348  |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}</ref>\n\nWithout success, Tversky and Kahneman used what they described as \"a series of increasingly desperate manipulations\" to get their subjects to recognise the logical error.

Imagining for simplicity that exactly half of the babies born in a hospital are male, the ratio will not be exactly half in every time period. On some days, more girls will be born and on others, more boys. The question was, does the likelihood of deviating from exactly half depend on whether there are many or few births per day? It is a well-established consequence of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling theory]] that proportions will vary much more day-to-day when the typical number of births per day is small. However, people's answers to the problem do not reflect this fact. They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=70\u201371}}</ref>\n\n====Dilution effect====\n[[Richard E. Nisbett]] and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the ''dilution effect'', in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a [[stereotype]]. Subjects in one study were asked whether \"Paul\" or \"Susan\" was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kunda |1999| pp=68\u201370}}</ref> This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make relative information less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.<ref name=\"Zukier1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Zukier|first1=Henry|title=The dilution effect: The role of the correlation and the dispersion of predictor variables in the use of nondiagnostic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|year=1982|pages=1163\u20131174|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1163}}</ref>\n\n====Misperception of randomness====\nRepresentativeness explains systematic errors that people make when judging the probability of random events. For example, in a sequence of coin tosses, each of which comes up heads (H) or tails (T), people reliably tend to judge a clearly patterned sequence such as HHHTTT as less likely than a less patterned sequence such as HTHTTH. These sequences have exactly the same probability, but people tend to see the more clearly patterned sequences as less representative of randomness, and so less likely to result from a random process.<ref name=\"tk1974\"/><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=71\u201372}}</ref> Tversky and Kahneman argued that this effect underlies the [[gambler's fallacy]]; a tendency to expect outcomes to even out over the short run, like expecting a [[roulette]] wheel to come up black because the last several throws came up red.<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /><ref name=\"smallnumbers\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Belief in the law of small numbers.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1971|volume=76|issue=2|pages=105\u2013110|doi=10.1037/h0031322|citeseerx=10.1.1.592.3838}} reprinted in {{cite book|editor1=Daniel Kahneman |editor2=Paul Slovic |editor3=Amos Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521284141|pages=23\u201331}}</ref> They emphasised that even experts in statistics were susceptible to this illusion: in a 1971 survey of professional psychologists, they found that respondents expected samples to be overly representative of the population they were drawn from.

Hence the anchor contaminates the estimate, even if it is clearly irrelevant. In one experiment, subjects watched a number being selected from a spinning \"wheel of fortune\". They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, \"Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the [[United Nations]] larger or smaller than 65%?\" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given.<ref name=baron_anch /><ref name=plous_anch />  Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect.

An example is where people predict the value of a stock market index on a particular day by defining an upper and lower bound so that they are 98% confident the true value will fall in that range. A reliable finding is that people anchor their upper and lower bounds too close to their best estimate.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /> This leads to an [[overconfidence effect]]. One much-replicated finding is that when people are 98% certain that a number is in a particular range, they are wrong about thirty to forty percent of the time.<ref name=tk1974 /><ref name=\"state\">{{citation|last=Lichtenstein |first=Sarah |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischoff|first3= Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman| editor2-first=Paul|editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos|editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn= 9780521284141 |pages=306\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nAnchoring also causes particular difficulty when many numbers are combined into a composite judgment. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this by asking a group of people to rapidly estimate the product 8&nbsp;x&nbsp;7&nbsp;x&nbsp;6&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;x&nbsp;4&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.

Both groups underestimated the answer by a wide margin, but the latter group's average estimate was significantly smaller.<ref name=suther168 /> The explanation in terms of anchoring is that people multiply the first few terms of each product and anchor on that figure.<ref name=suther168 /> A less abstract task is to estimate the probability that an aircraft will crash, given that there are numerous possible faults each with a likelihood of one in a million. A common finding from studies of these tasks is that people anchor on the small component probabilities and so underestimate the total.<ref name=\"suther168\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=168\u2013170}}</ref> A corresponding effect happens when people estimate the probability of multiple events happening in sequence, such as an [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator bet]] in horse racing. For this kind of judgment, anchoring on the individual probabilities results in an overestimation of the combined probability.<ref name=suther168 />\n\n====Examples====\nPeople's valuation of goods, and the quantities they buy, respond to anchoring effects. In one experiment, people wrote down the last two digits of their [[social security number]]s. They were then asked to consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment. They then entered an [[auction]] to bid for these items.

In one experiment, 48 teachers were given bundles of student essays, each of which had to be graded and returned. They were also given a fictional list of the students' previous grades. The mean of these grades affected the grades that teachers awarded for the essay.<ref>{{citation |editor1-first=Jean-Paul |editor1-last=Caverni |editor2-first= Jean-Marc |editor2-last=Fabr\u00e9 |editor3-first=Michel |editor3-last=Gonz\u00e1lez |publisher=Elsevier |title=Cognitive biases |year=1990|chapter=The Anchoring-Adjustment Heuristic in an 'Information-Rich, Real World Setting': Knowledge Assessment by Experts | first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Caverni|first2=Jean-Luc |last2=P\u00e9ris|pages=35\u201345|isbn=9780444884138}}</ref>\n\nOne study showed that anchoring affected the sentences in a fictional rape trial.<ref name=\"mes183\" /> The subjects were trial judges with, on average, more than fifteen years of experience. They read documents including witness testimony, expert statements, the relevant penal code, and the final pleas from the prosecution and defence. The two conditions of this experiment differed in just one respect: the prosecutor demanded a 34-month sentence in one condition and 12 months in the other; there was an eight-month difference between the average sentences handed out in these two conditions.<ref name=\"mes183\">{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=183}}</ref> In a similar mock trial, the subjects took the role of jurors in a civil case.

Although the facts of the case were the same each time, jurors given the higher range decided on an award that was about three times higher. This happened even though the subjects were explicitly warned not to treat the requests as evidence.<ref name=HastieDawes_anch />\n\nAssessments can also be influenced by the stimuli provided.  In one review, researchers found that if a stimulus is perceived to be important or carry \"weight\" to a situation, that people were more likely to attribute that stimulus as heavier physically.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rabelo | first1 = A.

A ''cognitive laziness'' approach argues that heuristics are inevitable shortcuts given the limitations of the human brain. According to the ''natural assessments'' approach, some complex calculations are already done rapidly and automatically by the brain, and other judgments make use of these processes rather than calculating from scratch. This has led to a theory called \"attribute substitution\", which says that people often handle a complicated question by answering a different, related question, without being aware that this is what they are doing.<ref name=revisited /> A third approach argues that heuristics perform just as well as more complicated decision-making procedures, but more quickly and with less information. This perspective emphasises the \"fast and frugal\" nature of heuristics.<ref name=\"Hardman_frugal\">{{harvnb|Hardman|2009|pp=13\u201316}}</ref>\n\n===Cognitive laziness===\n{{See also|Cognitive miser}}\nAn ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K.

Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.<ref name=\"revisited\"/><ref name=\"newell\"/>\n\nIn 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g. the [[Luminance|brightness]] of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded by [[Neuron|brain cell]]s in a way that is independent of [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be very different in nature.<ref name=\"revisited\"/>\n\n{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\" /> |width=30% |align=right}}\nKahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:<ref name=\"revisited\"/>\n# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible.<br />Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory (\"What is your birthday?\") or about current experience (\"Do you feel thirsty now?).\n# An associated attribute is highly accessible.<br />This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life and is then asked how happy they are might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than other areas.\n# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system.<br />For example, when asked \"A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\"/> An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.\n\nKahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though \"death of any kind\" includes \"death in a terrorist attack\", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter. Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.\n\n===Fast and frugal===\n[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and colleagues have argued that heuristics can be used to make judgments that are accurate rather than biased. According to them, heuristics are \"fast and frugal\" alternatives to more complicated procedures, giving answers that are just as good.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M.

He determined how often each heuristic selected alternatives with highest-through-lowest expected value in a series of randomly generated decision situations. He found that most of the simulated heuristics selected alternatives with highest expected value and almost never selected alternatives with lowest expected value. More information about the simulation can be found in his \"Efficient decision heuristics\" article (1980).<ref name=\"Thorngate1980\">{{cite journal|last1=Thorngate|first1=Warren|title=Efficient decision heuristics|journal=Behavioral Science|volume=25|issue=3|year=1980|pages=219\u2013225|doi=10.1002/bs.3830250306}}</ref>\n\n===\"Beautiful-is-familiar\" effect===\nPsychologist Beno\u00eet Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before.

The heuristic attribute in this case is a \"warm glow\"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive.

According to Sunstein, the opinions of trusted political or religious authorities can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405\u2013434 |url= http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf |ssrn=1401432|accessdate=2009-09-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023946/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf|archivedate=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sunstein has been challenged as not providing enough evidence that attribute substitution, rather than other processes, is at work in these cases.<ref name=\"shah2008\">{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author2=Daniel M.

One may conclude that a glass vase is more valuable than a drawing, merely because it may take longer for the vase.

Simon]] formulated one of the first models of heuristics, known as [[satisficing]]. His more general research program posed the question of how humans make decisions when the conditions for [[rational choice theory]] are not met, that is how people decide under uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|date=1989|title=The Scientist as Problem Solver.|journal=|location=Fort Belvoir, VA|volume=|pages=|doi=10.21236/ada240569}}</ref> Simon is also known as the father of [[bounded rationality]], which he understood as the study of the match (or mismatch) between heuristics and decision environments. This program was later extended into the study of [[ecological rationality]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] took a different approach, linking heuristics to cognitive biases. Their typical experimental setup consisted of a rule of logic or probability, embedded in a verbal description of a judgement problem, and demonstrated that people's intuitive judgement deviated from the rule. The \"Linda problem\" below gives an example. The deviation is then explained by a heuristic. This research, called the heuristics-and-biases program, challenged the idea that human beings are rational actors and first gained worldwide attention in 1974 with the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper \"[[#CITEREFTverskyKahneman1974|Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]]\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|date=1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124\u20131131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T}}</ref>  and although the originally proposed heuristics have been challenged in the further debate,<ref name=\"Gigerenzer1996\">{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=G.|year=1996|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592\u2013596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}</ref> this research program has changed the field by permanently setting the research questions.<ref name=\"FiedlerSydow2015\">{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology: Revising the Classical Studies|last1=Fiedler|first1=Klaus|last2=von Sydow|first2=Momme|date=2015|publisher=Sage, London|isbn=978-1-4462-9447-5|editor-last1=Eysenck|editor-first1=Michael W.|pages=146\u2013161|chapter=Heuristics and Biases: Beyond Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) Judgment under Uncertainty|editor-last2=Groome|editor-first2=David|chapterurl=http://crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de/sites/default/files/vonSydow/Fiedler__von_Sydow_2015_Heuristic_and_biases_Beyond_Tversky__Kahneman_s_1974_In__Eysenck_Groome_Ch_12.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe original ideas by Herbert Simon were taken up in the 1990s by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others.

If one has heard of Roddick but not of Robredo, the recognition heuristic leads to the prediction that Roddick will win. The recognition heuristic exploits partial ignorance, if one has heard of both or no player, a different strategy is needed. Studies of Wimbledon 2003 and 2005 have shown that the recognition heuristic applied by semi-ignorant amateur players predicted the outcomes of all gentlemen single games as well and better than the seedings of the Wimbledon experts (who had heard of all players), as well as the ATP rankings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serwe|first=Sascha|last2=Frings|first2=Christian|date=2006|title=Who will win Wimbledon?

It is called a \u201ctree\u201d because it can be represented like a decision tree in which one asks a sequence of questions. Unlike a full decision tree, however, it is an incomplete tree \u2013 to save time and reduce the danger of overfitting.\n\nFigure 1 shows a fast-and-frugal tree used for screening for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Just like take-the-best, the tree has a search rule, stopping rule, and decision rule:\n\n''Search rule'': Search through cues in a specified order.\n''Stopping rule'': Stop search if an exit is reached.\n''Decision rule'': Classify the person according to the exit (here: No HIV or HIV).\n\nIn the HIV tree, an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test is conducted first. If the outcome is negative, then the testing procedure stops and the client is informed of the good news, that is, \u201cno HIV.\u201d If, however, the result is positive, a second ELISA test is performed, preferably from a different manufacturer. If the second ELISA is negative, then the procedure stops and the client is informed of having \u201cno HIV.\u201d However, if the result is positive, a final test, the Western blot, is conducted.\n\n[[File:Fast-and-frugal-p1.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: Screening for HIV in the general public follows the logic of a fast-and-frugal tree. If the first enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d If not, a second ELISA is performed; if it is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d Otherwise, a Western blot test is performed, which determines the final classification]]\n\nIn general, for n binary cues, a fast-and-frugal tree has exactly n + 1 exits \u2013 one for each cue and two for the final cue. A full decision tree, in contrast, requires 2<sup>n</sup> exits. The order of cues (tests) in a fast-and-frugal tree is determined by the sensitivity and specificity of the cues, or by other considerations such as the costs of the tests. In the case of the HIV tree, the ELISA is ranked first because it produces fewer misses than the Western blot test, and also is less expensive. The Western blot test, in contrast, produces fewer false alarms. In a full tree, in contrast, order does not matter for the accuracy of the classifications.\n\nFast-and-frugal trees are descriptive or prescriptive models of decision making under uncertainty. For instance, an analysis or court decisions reported that the best model of how London magistrates make bail decisions is a fast and frugal tree.<ref>{{Citation|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.01438|pmid=12661681|title=Psychological Models of Professional Decision Making|journal=Psychological Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=175\u2013180|year=2003|last1=Dhami|first1=Mandeep K.}}</ref> The HIV tree is both prescriptive\u2013 physicians are taught the procedure \u2013 and a descriptive model, that is, most physicians actually follow the procedure.\n\n==Informal models of heuristics==\n\nIn their initial research, Tversky and Kahneman proposed three heuristics\u2014availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Subsequent work has identified many more. Heuristics that underlie judgment are called \"judgment heuristics\". Another type, called \"evaluation heuristics\", are used to judge the desirability of possible choices.<ref>{{harvnb| Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=210\u2013211}}</ref>\n\n===Availability===\n{{main|Availability heuristic}}\nIn psychology, ''availability'' is the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic.<ref name=\"tkavail\">{{Citation|last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2= Kahneman |first2=Daniel |year=1973 |title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}</ref> When an infrequent event can be brought easily and vividly to mind, this heuristic overestimates its likelihood. For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a [[tornado]] or [[terrorism]]. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.<ref name=\"suther_avail\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=16\u201317}}</ref> On the other hand, common but mundane events are hard to bring to mind, so their likelihoods tend to be underestimated. These include deaths from [[suicide]]s, [[stroke]]s, and [[diabetes]]. This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.<ref name=\"plous_avail\" /> It may also play a role in the appeal of [[Lottery|lotteries]]: to someone buying a ticket, the well-publicised, jubilant winners are more available than the millions of people who have won nothing.<ref name=\"suther_avail\" />\n\nWhen people judge whether more [[English language|English]] words begin with ''T'' or with ''K'' ,  the availability heuristic gives a quick way to answer the question. Words that begin with ''T'' come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with ''K'' in the first position or with ''K'' in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with ''K'', such as ''kangaroo'', ''kitchen'', or ''kept''. It is harder to think of words with ''K'' as the third letter, such as ''lake'', or ''acknowledge'', although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that ''K'' is more common at the start of words.<ref name=\"tk1974\" >{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}</ref> In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.<ref name=\"tkavail\" />\n\nIn one experiment that occurred before the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. Presidential election]], some participants were asked to imagine [[Gerald Ford]] winning, while others did the same for a [[Jimmy Carter]] victory. Each group subsequently viewed their allocated candidate as significantly more likely to win. The researchers found a similar effect when students imagined a good or a bad season for a [[college football]] team.<ref name=\"Carroll1978\">{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=J.|title=The Effect of Imagining an Event on Expectations for the Event: An Interpretation in Terms of the Availability Heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88\u201396|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}</ref> The effect of imagination on subjective likelihood has been replicated by several other researchers.<ref name=\"plous_avail\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nA concept's availability can be affected by how recently and how frequently it has been brought to mind. In one study, subjects were given partial sentences to complete. The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]''. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect. A greater interval between the initial task and the judgment decreased the effect.<ref name=\"SrullWyer1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Srull|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Wyer|first2=Robert S.|title=The Role of Category Accessibility in the Interpretation of Information About Persons: Some Determinants and Implications|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=10|year=1979|pages=1660\u20131672|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1660|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.4255}}</ref>\n\nTversky and Kahneman offered the availability heuristic as an explanation for [[illusory correlation]]s in which people wrongly judge two events to be associated with each other. They explained that people judge correlation on the basis of the ease of imagining or recalling the two events together.<ref name=\"tkavail\" /><ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\n===Representativeness===\n{{main|Representativeness heuristic}}\n[[File:Generalization_process_using_trees_PNG_version.png|alt=Diagram|right|thumb|243x243px|Snap judgement of whether novel object fits an existing category]]\nThe representativeness heuristic is seen when people use categories, for example when deciding whether or not a person is a criminal. An individual thing has a high ''representativeness'' for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of representativeness, they are using the representativeness heuristic. \"Representative\" is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and representativeness is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref name=\"plous_repres\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=109\u2013120}}</ref> While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the ''base rates''). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the [[base rate fallacy]]. Representativeness explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.<ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\nThe representativeness heuristic is also an explanation of how people judge cause and effect: when they make these judgements on the basis of similarity, they are also said to be using the representativeness heuristic. This can lead to a bias, incorrectly finding causal relationships between things that resemble one another and missing them when the cause and effect are very different. Examples of this include both the belief that \"emotionally relevant events ought to have emotionally relevant causes\", and magical [[associative thinking]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Richard E.|last1= Nisbett |last2= Ross|first2=Lee|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|url=https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=9780134450735|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb/page/115 115\u2013118]}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|title=Like Goes with Like: The Role of Representativeness in Erroneous and Pseudo-Scientific Beliefs|date=2002-07-08|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511808098A046/type/book_part|work=Heuristics and Biases|pages=617\u2013624|editor-last=Gilovich|editor-first=Thomas|edition=1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511808098.036.|isbn=978-0-521-79260-8|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Savitsky|first2=Kenneth|editor2-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Dale|editor3-last=Kahneman|editor3-first=Daniel}}</ref>\n\n====of base rates====\n{{main|Base rate fallacy}}\nA 1973 experiment used a psychological profile of Tom W., a fictional graduate student.<ref name=\"ktprediction\">{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Amos Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237\u2013251 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}</ref> One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (including Law, Engineering and Library Science). Another group had to rate how likely it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e. the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). If people based their judgments on probability, they would say that Tom is more likely to study Humanities than Library Science, because there are many more Humanities students, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.<ref name=\"ktprediction\" />\n\n====Conjunction fallacy====\n{{main|Conjunction fallacy}}\nWhen people rely on representativeness, they can fall into an error which breaks a fundamental law of [[probability]].<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /> Tversky and Kahneman gave subjects a short character sketch of a woman called Linda, describing her as, \"31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations\". People reading this description then ranked the likelihood of different statements about Linda. Amongst others, these included \"Linda is a bank teller\", and, \"Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\". People showed a strong tendency to rate the latter, more specific statement as more likely, even though a conjunction of the form \"Linda is both ''X'' and ''Y''\" can never be more probable than the more general statement \"Linda is ''X''\". The explanation in terms of heuristics is that the judgment was distorted because, for the readers, the character sketch was representative of the sort of person who might be an active feminist but not of someone who works in a bank. A similar exercise concerned Bill, described as \"intelligent but unimaginative\". A great majority of people reading this character sketch rated \"Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby\", as more likely than \"Bill plays jazz for a hobby\".<ref name=\"tkconjunction\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293\u2013315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293}}  reprinted in {{Citation |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=19\u201348  |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}</ref>\n\nWithout success, Tversky and Kahneman used what they described as \"a series of increasingly desperate manipulations\" to get their subjects to recognise the logical error.

Imagining for simplicity that exactly half of the babies born in a hospital are male, the ratio will not be exactly half in every time period. On some days, more girls will be born and on others, more boys. The question was, does the likelihood of deviating from exactly half depend on whether there are many or few births per day? It is a well-established consequence of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling theory]] that proportions will vary much more day-to-day when the typical number of births per day is small. However, people's answers to the problem do not reflect this fact. They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=70\u201371}}</ref>\n\n====Dilution effect====\n[[Richard E. Nisbett]] and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the ''dilution effect'', in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a [[stereotype]]. Subjects in one study were asked whether \"Paul\" or \"Susan\" was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kunda |1999| pp=68\u201370}}</ref> This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make relative information less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.<ref name=\"Zukier1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Zukier|first1=Henry|title=The dilution effect: The role of the correlation and the dispersion of predictor variables in the use of nondiagnostic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|year=1982|pages=1163\u20131174|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1163}}</ref>\n\n====Misperception of randomness====\nRepresentativeness explains systematic errors that people make when judging the probability of random events. For example, in a sequence of coin tosses, each of which comes up heads (H) or tails (T), people reliably tend to judge a clearly patterned sequence such as HHHTTT as less likely than a less patterned sequence such as HTHTTH.

Hence the anchor contaminates the estimate, even if it is clearly irrelevant. In one experiment, subjects watched a number being selected from a spinning \"wheel of fortune\". They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, \"Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the [[United Nations]] larger or smaller than 65%?\" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given.<ref name=baron_anch /><ref name=plous_anch />  Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect. An alternative theory is that people form their estimates on evidence which is selectively brought to mind by the anchor.<ref>{{harvnb |Koehler|Harvey|2004|p=99}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cote de Brouilly bottle of Beaujolais wine.jpg|thumb|160px|The amount of money people will pay in an auction for a bottle of wine can be influenced by considering an arbitrary two-digit number.]]\n\nThe anchoring effect has been demonstrated by a wide variety of experiments both in laboratories and in the real world.<ref name=plous_anch /><ref name=mes197 /> It remains when the subjects are offered money as an incentive to be accurate, or when they are explicitly told not to base their judgment on the anchor.<ref name=\"mes197\">{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|pp=185\u2013186, 197}}</ref> The effect is stronger when people have to make their judgments quickly.<ref name=yud_anch /> Subjects in these experiments lack [[introspection|introspective awareness]] of the heuristic, denying that the anchor affected their estimates.<ref name=yud_anch />\n\nEven when the anchor value is obviously random or extreme, it can still contaminate estimates.<ref name=mes197 /> One experiment asked subjects to estimate the year of [[Albert Einstein]]'s first visit to the United States. Anchors of 1215 and 1992 contaminated the answers just as much as more sensible anchor years.<ref name=\"yud_anch\">{{Harvnb |Yudkowsky|2008|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref> Other experiments asked subjects if the average temperature in [[San Francisco]] is more or less than 558 degrees, or whether there had been more or fewer than 100,025 top ten albums by [[The Beatles]]. These deliberately absurd anchors still affected estimates of the true numbers.<ref name=\"plous_anch\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=145\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nAnchoring results in a particularly strong bias when estimates are stated in the form of a [[confidence interval]]. An example is where people predict the value of a stock market index on a particular day by defining an upper and lower bound so that they are 98% confident the true value will fall in that range. A reliable finding is that people anchor their upper and lower bounds too close to their best estimate.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /> This leads to an [[overconfidence effect]]. One much-replicated finding is that when people are 98% certain that a number is in a particular range, they are wrong about thirty to forty percent of the time.<ref name=tk1974 /><ref name=\"state\">{{citation|last=Lichtenstein |first=Sarah |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischoff|first3= Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman| editor2-first=Paul|editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos|editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn= 9780521284141 |pages=306\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nAnchoring also causes particular difficulty when many numbers are combined into a composite judgment. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this by asking a group of people to rapidly estimate the product 8&nbsp;x&nbsp;7&nbsp;x&nbsp;6&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;x&nbsp;4&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.

Both groups underestimated the answer by a wide margin, but the latter group's average estimate was significantly smaller.<ref name=suther168 /> The explanation in terms of anchoring is that people multiply the first few terms of each product and anchor on that figure.<ref name=suther168 /> A less abstract task is to estimate the probability that an aircraft will crash, given that there are numerous possible faults each with a likelihood of one in a million. A common finding from studies of these tasks is that people anchor on the small component probabilities and so underestimate the total.<ref name=\"suther168\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=168\u2013170}}</ref> A corresponding effect happens when people estimate the probability of multiple events happening in sequence, such as an [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator bet]] in horse racing. For this kind of judgment, anchoring on the individual probabilities results in an overestimation of the combined probability.<ref name=suther168 />\n\n====Examples====\nPeople's valuation of goods, and the quantities they buy, respond to anchoring effects. In one experiment, people wrote down the last two digits of their [[social security number]]s. They were then asked to consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment. They then entered an [[auction]] to bid for these items.

In one experiment, 48 teachers were given bundles of student essays, each of which had to be graded and returned. They were also given a fictional list of the students' previous grades. The mean of these grades affected the grades that teachers awarded for the essay.<ref>{{citation |editor1-first=Jean-Paul |editor1-last=Caverni |editor2-first= Jean-Marc |editor2-last=Fabr\u00e9 |editor3-first=Michel |editor3-last=Gonz\u00e1lez |publisher=Elsevier |title=Cognitive biases |year=1990|chapter=The Anchoring-Adjustment Heuristic in an 'Information-Rich, Real World Setting': Knowledge Assessment by Experts | first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Caverni|first2=Jean-Luc |last2=P\u00e9ris|pages=35\u201345|isbn=9780444884138}}</ref>\n\nOne study showed that anchoring affected the sentences in a fictional rape trial.<ref name=\"mes183\" /> The subjects were trial judges with, on average, more than fifteen years of experience. They read documents including witness testimony, expert statements, the relevant penal code, and the final pleas from the prosecution and defence. The two conditions of this experiment differed in just one respect: the prosecutor demanded a 34-month sentence in one condition and 12 months in the other; there was an eight-month difference between the average sentences handed out in these two conditions.<ref name=\"mes183\">{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=183}}</ref> In a similar mock trial, the subjects took the role of jurors in a civil case. They were either asked to award damages \"in the range from $15 million to $50 million\" or \"in the range from $50 million to $150 million\". Although the facts of the case were the same each time, jurors given the higher range decided on an award that was about three times higher. This happened even though the subjects were explicitly warned not to treat the requests as evidence.<ref name=HastieDawes_anch />\n\nAssessments can also be influenced by the stimuli provided.  In one review, researchers found that if a stimulus is perceived to be important or carry \"weight\" to a situation, that people were more likely to attribute that stimulus as heavier physically.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rabelo | first1 = A.

A ''cognitive laziness'' approach argues that heuristics are inevitable shortcuts given the limitations of the human brain. According to the ''natural assessments'' approach, some complex calculations are already done rapidly and automatically by the brain, and other judgments make use of these processes rather than calculating from scratch. This has led to a theory called \"attribute substitution\", which says that people often handle a complicated question by answering a different, related question, without being aware that this is what they are doing.<ref name=revisited /> A third approach argues that heuristics perform just as well as more complicated decision-making procedures, but more quickly and with less information. This perspective emphasises the \"fast and frugal\" nature of heuristics.<ref name=\"Hardman_frugal\">{{harvnb|Hardman|2009|pp=13\u201316}}</ref>\n\n===Cognitive laziness===\n{{See also|Cognitive miser}}\nAn ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K.

Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.<ref name=\"revisited\"/><ref name=\"newell\"/>\n\nIn 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g. the [[Luminance|brightness]] of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded by [[Neuron|brain cell]]s in a way that is independent of [[Stimulus modality|modality]].

For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life and is then asked how happy they are might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than other areas.\n# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system.<br />For example, when asked \"A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\"/> An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.\n\nKahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though \"death of any kind\" includes \"death in a terrorist attack\", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter.

According to Sunstein, the opinions of trusted political or religious authorities can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405\u2013434 |url= http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf |ssrn=1401432|accessdate=2009-09-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023946/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf|archivedate=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sunstein has been challenged as not providing enough evidence that attribute substitution, rather than other processes, is at work in these cases.<ref name=\"shah2008\">{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author2=Daniel M.

This is usually done similar to a quote where there is no tax imposed and then once the externality reaches a certain point there is a very high tax imposed. However, since regulators do not always have all the information on the externality it can be difficult to impose the right tax. Once the externality is internalized through imposing a tax the competitive equilibrium is now Pareto optimal.\n\nFor example, manufacturing activities that cause [[air pollution]] impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of individuals who choose to [[Fireproofing|fire-proof]] their homes may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as [[pollution]], the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of [[externalization]] is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in [[public safety]], less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others.  For the purpose of these statements, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved.<ref>[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|J.J.

Pigou]] (1877\u20131959)  is credited with formalizing the concept of externalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0025694212/student_view0/chapter16/origin_of_the_idea.html |title=Economics (McConnell), 18th Edition Chapter 16: Public Goods, Externalities, and Information Asymmetries}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nA negative externality is any difference between the private cost of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social cost. In simple terms, a negative externality is anything that causes an indirect cost to individuals. An example is the toxic gases that are released from industries or mines, these gases cause harm to individuals within the surrounding area and have to bear a cost (indirect cost) to get rid of that harm.  Conversely, a positive externality is any difference between the private benefit of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social benefit. A positive externality is anything that causes an indirect benefit to individuals. For example, planting trees makes individuals' property look nicer and it also cleans the surrounding areas.\n\n===Formal definition===\nSuppose that there are <math>K</math> different possible allocations and <math>N</math> different agents, where <math>K,N < \\infty </math> and <math>N \\geq 2</math>. Suppose that each agent has a type <math> \\theta_i \\sim F_i[0,1] </math> and that each agent gets payoff <math> v_i(\\theta_i, k) + t_i </math>, where <math> t_i </math> is the transfer paid by the <math>i</math>-th agent. A map <math>f=(\\kappa,t_1,\\ldots,t_N) </math> is a ''social choice function'' if\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^N t_i(\\theta) \\leq 0</math>\n\nfor all <math> \\theta \\in [0,1]^N.</math> An allocation <math> \\kappa \\colon [0,1]^N \\to K</math> is ''ex-post efficient'' if\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\\theta_i, \\kappa(\\theta)) \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\\theta_i, k)</math>\n\nfor all <math>\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_N) \\in [0,1]^N</math> and all <math>k \\in K.</math>\n\nLet <math> \\kappa^* </math> denote an ex-post efficient allocation and let <math>\\tilde{\\kappa}_i</math> denote an ex-post efficient allocation without agent <math>i</math>. Then the ''externality'' imposed by agent <math>i</math> on the other agents is\n\n:<math> \\sum_{j \\neq i} v_j (\\theta_j, \\tilde{\\kappa}_i (\\theta_{-i})) - \\sum_{j \\neq i} v_j (\\theta_j, \\kappa^* (\\theta)), </math><ref>{{Cite book|title=Microeconomic Theory|last=Mas-Colell|first=Andreu|publisher=Oxford|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-507340-9|location=|page=878}}</ref>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta_{-i}</math> is the type vector <math>\\theta</math> without its <math>i</math>-th component. Intuitively, the first term is the hypothetical total payoff for all agents <math>j \\neq i</math> given that agent <math>i</math> does not exist, and the second (subtracted) term is the actual total payoff for all agents <math>j \\neq i</math> given that agent <math>i</math> does exist.\n\n==Implications==\n[[File:externality.svg|450px|thumb|right|External costs and benefits]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n\nVoluntary exchange is by definition mutually beneficial to both business parties involved because the parties would not agree to undertake it if either thought it detrimental to their interests. However, a transaction can cause effects on third parties without their knowledge or consent. From the perspective of those affected, these effects may be negative (pollution from a nearby factory), or positive (honey bees kept for honey that also pollinate neighboring crops). Neoclassical [[welfare economics]] asserts that, under plausible conditions, the existence of externalities will result in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, whereas those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dahlman |first1=Carl |title=The Problem of Externality |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |date=April 1979 |volume=22 |page=141\u2013162 |doi=10.1086/466936 |url=http://cafehayek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Carl-Dahlman.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nA voluntary exchange may reduce societal welfare if external costs exist. The person who is affected by the negative externalities in the case of air pollution will see it as lowered [[utility]]: either subjective displeasure or potentially explicit costs, such as higher medical expenses. The externality may even be seen as a [[trespass]] on their [[lung]]s, violating their property rights. Thus, an external cost may pose an [[ethical]] or [[political]] problem. Negative externalities are [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inefficient]], and since Pareto efficiency underpins the justification for private property, they undermine the whole idea of a market economy. For these reasons, negative externalities are more problematic than positive externalities. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Caplan |first1=Bryan |title=Externalities |url=https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Externalities.html |website=The Library of Economics and Liberty |publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc. |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nPositive externalities, while Pareto efficient, are still market failures that undermine [[allocative efficiency]] because less of the good will be produced than would be optimal for society as a whole in a theoretical model with no government. If those externalities were internalized, the producer would be incentivized to produce more. Goods with positive externalities include education (believed to increase societal productivity and well-being, though some benefits are internalized in the form of higher wages), public health initiatives (which may reduce the health risks and costs for third parties for such things as transmittable diseases) and law enforcement.\n\nPositive externalities are often associated with the [[free rider problem]]. For example, individuals who are vaccinated reduce the risk of contracting the relevant disease for all others around them, and at high levels of vaccination, society may receive large health and welfare benefits ([[herd immunity]]); but any one individual can refuse vaccination, still avoiding the disease by \"free riding\" on the costs borne by others.\n\nThere are a number of theoretical means of improving overall social utility when negative externalities are involved. The market-driven approach to correcting externalities is to \"''internalize''\" third party costs and benefits, for example, by requiring a polluter to repair any damage caused.

In other words, people neither gain nor lose anything at the margin, but benefits and costs do exist for those consumers within the given inframarginal range.\n\n===Technological===\nTechnological externalities directly affect a firm's production and therefore, indirectly influence an individual's consumption; and the overall impact of society; for example [[Open-source software]] or [[free software]] development by corporations.\n\n==Supply and demand diagram==\nThe usual economic analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a standard [[supply and demand]] diagram if the externality can be valued in terms of [[money]]. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the ''private cost'' that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the ''true'' cost that society as a whole pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal [[social cost]]. Similarly, there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as [[effective demand]] in the market.\n\nWhat curve is added depends on the type of externality that is described, but not whether it is positive or negative. Whenever an externality arises on the production side, there will be two supply curves (private and social cost). However, if the externality arises on the consumption side, there will be two demand curves instead (private and social benefit). This distinction is essential when it comes to resolving inefficiencies that are caused by externalities.\n\n===External costs===\n[[File:Negative externality.svg|384px|right|thumb|Demand curve with external costs; if social costs are not accounted for price is too low to cover all costs and hence quantity produced is unnecessarily high (because the producers of the good and their customers are essentially underpaying the total, real [[factors of production]].)]]\nThe graph shows the effects of a negative externality. For example, the [[steel industry]] is assumed to be selling in a competitive market \u2013 before pollution-control laws were imposed and enforced (e.g. under [[laissez-faire]]). The marginal private cost is less than the marginal social or public cost by the amount of the external cost, i.e., the cost of [[air pollution]] and [[water pollution]]. This is represented by the vertical distance between the two supply curves. It is assumed that there are no external benefits, so that social benefit ''equals'' individual benefit.\n\nIf the consumers only take into account their own private cost, they will end up at price '''P<sub>p</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''', instead of the more efficient price '''P<sub>s</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>s</sub>'''. These latter reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased ''only'' as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a [[free market]] is ''[[inefficiency|inefficient]]'' since at the quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''', the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole would be better off if the goods between '''Q<sub>p</sub>''' and '''Q<sub>s</sub>''' had not been produced. The problem is that people are buying and consuming ''too much'' steel.\n\nThis discussion implies that negative externalities (such as pollution) are ''more than'' merely an ethical problem. The problem is one of the disjunctures between marginal private and social costs that are not solved by the [[free market]]. It is a problem of societal communication and coordination to balance costs and benefits. This also implies that pollution is not something solved by competitive markets. Some ''collective'' solution is needed, such as a court system to allow parties affected by the pollution to be compensated, government intervention banning or discouraging pollution, or economic incentives such as [[green tax]]es.\n\n===External benefits===\n[[File:Positive externality.svg|384px|right|thumb|Supply curve with external benefits; when the market does not account for the additional social benefits of a good both the price for the good and the quantity produced are lower than the market could bear.]]\nThe graph shows the effects of a positive or beneficial externality. For example, the industry supplying smallpox vaccinations is assumed to be selling in a competitive market.  The marginal private benefit of getting the vaccination is less than the marginal social or public benefit by the amount of the external benefit (for example, society as a whole is increasingly protected from smallpox by each vaccination, including those who refuse to participate). This marginal external benefit of getting a smallpox shot is represented by the vertical distance between the two demand curves. Assume there are no external costs, so that social cost ''equals'' individual cost.\n\nIf consumers only take into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price '''P<sub>p</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''' as before, instead of the more efficient price '''P<sub>s</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>s</sub>'''. This latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an [[free market|unfettered market]] is ''[[inefficiency|inefficient]]'' since at the quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''', the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying ''too few'' vaccinations.\n\nThe issue of external benefits is related to that of [[public goods]], which are goods where it is difficult if not impossible to exclude people from benefits. The production of a public good has beneficial externalities for all, or almost all, of the public. As with external costs, there is a problem here of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This also implies that vaccination is not something solved by competitive markets. The government may have to step in with a collective solution, such as subsidizing or legally requiring vaccine use. If the government does this, the good is called a [[merit good]].

While property rights to some things, such as objects, land, and money can be easily defined and protected, air, water, and wild animals often flow freely across personal and political borders, making it much more difficult to assign ownership. This incentivizes agents to consume them without paying the full cost, leading to negative externalities. Positive externalities similarly accrue from poorly defined property rights. For example, a person who gets a flu vaccination cannot own part of the [[herd immunity]] this confers on society, so they may choose not to be vaccinated.\n\n==Possible solutions==\n===Solutions in non-market economies===\n\n*In a gift economy, people are expected to consume what they are given. If they consume a gift which they value less than somebody else, that other person who cannot consume it is harmed, an externality. A market system will reduce this kind of externality because the person who values it less is more likely to trade it away and the person who values it more is more likely to trade for it.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Solutions in market economies===\nThere are several general types of solutions to the problem of externalities, including both public- and private-sector resolutions:\n* [[Corporations]] or [[partnerships]] will allow confidential sharing of information among members, reducing the positive externalities that would occur if the information were shared in an economy consisting only of individuals. \n* [[Pigovian tax]]es or [[subsidies]] intended to redress economic injustices or imbalances.\n* [[Regulation]] to limit activity that might cause negative externalities\n* [[Government provision]] of services with positive externalities\n* [[Lawsuit]]s to compensate affected parties for negative externalities\n* [[Mediation]] or negotiation between those affected by externalities and those causing them\n\nA Pigovian tax (also called Pigouvian tax, after economist Arthur C. Pigou) is a tax imposed that is equal in value to the negative externality. The result is that the market outcome would be reduced to the efficient amount. A side effect is that revenue is raised for the government, reducing the amount of [[Distortion (economics)|distortionary]] taxes that the government must impose elsewhere.  Governments justify the use of Pigovian taxes saying that these taxes help the market reach an efficient outcome because this tax bridges the gap between marginal social costs and marginal private costs.<ref>Barthold, Thomas A. (1994). \"Issues in the Design of Excise Tax.\" ''Journal of Economic Perspectives.'' 133\u201351.</ref>\n\nSome arguments against Pigovian taxes say that the tax does not account for all the transfers and regulations involved with an externality. In other words, the tax only considers the amount of externality produced.<ref>Nye, John (2008). \"The Pigou Problem.\" ''The Cato Institute.'' 32\u201336.</ref> Another argument against the tax is that it does not take private property into consideration.  Under the Pigovian system, one firm, for example, can be taxed more than another firm, even though the other firm is actually producing greater amounts of the negative externality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=A. H. |last2=Yandle |first2=Bruce |title=The end of the externality revolution |journal=Social Philosophy and Policy |date=24 June 2009 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=130\u201350 |doi=10.1017/S0265052509090190 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the most common type of solution is a tacit agreement through the political process.  Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests.  Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm.  These laws and regulations can take the form of \"command and control\" regulation (such as setting standards, targets, or [[process requirements]]), or [[environmental pricing reform]] (such as [[ecotax]]es or other [[Pigovian tax]]es, [[pollution market|tradable pollution permits]] or the creation of markets for ecological services). The second type of resolution is a purely private agreement between the parties involved.\n\nGovernment intervention might not always be needed. Traditional ways of life may have evolved as ways to deal with external costs and benefits. Alternatively, democratically run communities can agree to deal with these costs and benefits in an amicable way. Externalities can sometimes be resolved by agreement between the parties involved. This resolution may even come about because of the threat of government action.\n\nThe private-sector may sometimes be able to drive society to the socially optimal resolution. [[Ronald Coase]] argued that an efficient outcome can sometimes be reached without government intervention. Some take this argument further, and make the political claim that government should restrict its role to facilitating bargaining among the affected groups or individuals and to enforcing any contracts that result.\n\nThis result, often known as the [[Coase theorem]], requires that\n* Property rights be well-defined\n* People act rationally\n* [[Transaction costs]] be minimal (costless bargaining)\n* [[Complete information]]\nIf all of these conditions apply, the private parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities. The second part of the [[Coase theorem]] asserts that, when these conditions hold, whoever holds the property rights, a [[Pareto efficient]] outcome will be reached through bargaining.\n\nThis theorem would not apply to the steel industry case discussed above. For example, with a steel factory that trespasses on the lungs of a large number of individuals with pollution, it is difficult if not impossible for any one person to negotiate with the producer, and there are large transaction costs. Hence the most common approach may be to regulate the firm (by imposing limits on the amount of pollution considered \"acceptable\") while paying for the regulation and enforcement with [[taxes]]. The case of the vaccinations would also not satisfy the requirements of the Coase theorem. Since the potential external beneficiaries of vaccination are the people themselves, the people would have to self-organize to pay each other to be vaccinated. But such an organization that involves the entire populace would be indistinguishable from government action.\n\nIn some cases, the Coase theorem is relevant. For example, if a [[logging|logger]] is planning to clear-cut a [[forest]] in a way that has a negative impact on a nearby [[resort]], the resort-owner and the logger could, in theory, get together to agree to a deal. For example, the resort-owner could pay the logger not to clear-cut \u2013 or could buy the forest. The most problematic situation, from Coase's perspective, occurs when the forest literally does not belong to anyone, or in any example in which there are not well-defined and enforceable property rights; the question of \"who\" owns the forest is not important, as any specific owner will have an interest in coming to an agreement with the resort owner (if such an agreement is mutually beneficial).\n\nHowever, the Coase theorem is difficult to implement because Coase does not offer a negotiation method.<ref>Varian, Hal (1994). \"A Solution to the Problem of Externalities When Agents Are Well Informed.\" ''The [[American Economic Review]].'' Vol. 84 No. 5.</ref> Moreover, Coasian solutions are unlikely to be reached due to the possibility of running into the [[assignment problem]], the [[holdout problem]], the [[free-rider problem]], or [[transaction cost]]s.

This is usually done similar to a quote where there is no tax imposed and then once the externality reaches a certain point there is a very high tax imposed. However, since regulators do not always have all the information on the externality it can be difficult to impose the right tax. Once the externality is internalized through imposing a tax the competitive equilibrium is now Pareto optimal.\n\nFor example, manufacturing activities that cause [[air pollution]] impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of individuals who choose to [[Fireproofing|fire-proof]] their homes may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as [[pollution]], the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of [[externalization]] is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in [[public safety]], less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others.  For the purpose of these statements, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved.<ref>[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|J.J.

In simple terms, a negative externality is anything that causes an indirect cost to individuals. An example is the toxic gases that are released from industries or mines, these gases cause harm to individuals within the surrounding area and have to bear a cost (indirect cost) to get rid of that harm.  Conversely, a positive externality is any difference between the private benefit of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social benefit. A positive externality is anything that causes an indirect benefit to individuals. For example, planting trees makes individuals' property look nicer and it also cleans the surrounding areas.\n\n===Formal definition===\nSuppose that there are <math>K</math> different possible allocations and <math>N</math> different agents, where <math>K,N < \\infty </math> and <math>N \\geq 2</math>. Suppose that each agent has a type <math> \\theta_i \\sim F_i[0,1] </math> and that each agent gets payoff <math> v_i(\\theta_i, k) + t_i </math>, where <math> t_i </math> is the transfer paid by the <math>i</math>-th agent. A map <math>f=(\\kappa,t_1,\\ldots,t_N) </math> is a ''social choice function'' if\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^N t_i(\\theta) \\leq 0</math>\n\nfor all <math> \\theta \\in [0,1]^N.</math> An allocation <math> \\kappa \\colon [0,1]^N \\to K</math> is ''ex-post efficient'' if\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\\theta_i, \\kappa(\\theta)) \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\\theta_i, k)</math>\n\nfor all <math>\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_N) \\in [0,1]^N</math> and all <math>k \\in K.</math>\n\nLet <math> \\kappa^* </math> denote an ex-post efficient allocation and let <math>\\tilde{\\kappa}_i</math> denote an ex-post efficient allocation without agent <math>i</math>. Then the ''externality'' imposed by agent <math>i</math> on the other agents is\n\n:<math> \\sum_{j \\neq i} v_j (\\theta_j, \\tilde{\\kappa}_i (\\theta_{-i})) - \\sum_{j \\neq i} v_j (\\theta_j, \\kappa^* (\\theta)), </math><ref>{{Cite book|title=Microeconomic Theory|last=Mas-Colell|first=Andreu|publisher=Oxford|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-507340-9|location=|page=878}}</ref>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta_{-i}</math> is the type vector <math>\\theta</math> without its <math>i</math>-th component. Intuitively, the first term is the hypothetical total payoff for all agents <math>j \\neq i</math> given that agent <math>i</math> does not exist, and the second (subtracted) term is the actual total payoff for all agents <math>j \\neq i</math> given that agent <math>i</math> does exist.\n\n==Implications==\n[[File:externality.svg|450px|thumb|right|External costs and benefits]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n\nVoluntary exchange is by definition mutually beneficial to both business parties involved because the parties would not agree to undertake it if either thought it detrimental to their interests. However, a transaction can cause effects on third parties without their knowledge or consent. From the perspective of those affected, these effects may be negative (pollution from a nearby factory), or positive (honey bees kept for honey that also pollinate neighboring crops). Neoclassical [[welfare economics]] asserts that, under plausible conditions, the existence of externalities will result in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, whereas those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dahlman |first1=Carl |title=The Problem of Externality |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |date=April 1979 |volume=22 |page=141\u2013162 |doi=10.1086/466936 |url=http://cafehayek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Carl-Dahlman.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nA voluntary exchange may reduce societal welfare if external costs exist. The person who is affected by the negative externalities in the case of air pollution will see it as lowered [[utility]]: either subjective displeasure or potentially explicit costs, such as higher medical expenses. The externality may even be seen as a [[trespass]] on their [[lung]]s, violating their property rights. Thus, an external cost may pose an [[ethical]] or [[political]] problem. Negative externalities are [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inefficient]], and since Pareto efficiency underpins the justification for private property, they undermine the whole idea of a market economy. For these reasons, negative externalities are more problematic than positive externalities. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Caplan |first1=Bryan |title=Externalities |url=https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Externalities.html |website=The Library of Economics and Liberty |publisher=Liberty Fund, Inc. |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nPositive externalities, while Pareto efficient, are still market failures that undermine [[allocative efficiency]] because less of the good will be produced than would be optimal for society as a whole in a theoretical model with no government. If those externalities were internalized, the producer would be incentivized to produce more. Goods with positive externalities include education (believed to increase societal productivity and well-being, though some benefits are internalized in the form of higher wages), public health initiatives (which may reduce the health risks and costs for third parties for such things as transmittable diseases) and law enforcement.\n\nPositive externalities are often associated with the [[free rider problem]]. For example, individuals who are vaccinated reduce the risk of contracting the relevant disease for all others around them, and at high levels of vaccination, society may receive large health and welfare benefits ([[herd immunity]]); but any one individual can refuse vaccination, still avoiding the disease by \"free riding\" on the costs borne by others.\n\nThere are a number of theoretical means of improving overall social utility when negative externalities are involved. The market-driven approach to correcting externalities is to \"''internalize''\" third party costs and benefits, for example, by requiring a polluter to repair any damage caused. But in many cases, internalizing costs or benefits is not feasible, especially if the true monetary values cannot be determined.\n\n[[Laissez-faire]] economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] sometimes refer to externalities as \"neighborhood effects\" or \"spillovers\", although externalities are not necessarily minor or localized. Similarly, [[Ludwig von Mises]] argues that externalities arise from lack of \"clear personal property definition.\"\n\n==Examples==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Classification of externalities\n|\n|Consumption\n|Production\n|-\n|Negative\n|Negative externalities in consumption\n|Negative externalities in production\n|-\n|Positive\n|Positive externalities in consumption\n|Positive externalities in production\n|}\n\n===Negative===\n[[File:Empire State Building Night.jpg|thumb|[[Light pollution]] is an example of an externality because the consumption of street lighting has an effect on bystanders that is not compensated for by the consumers of the lighting.]]\n\nA '''negative externality''' (also called \"external cost\" or \"external diseconomy\") is an economic activity that imposes a negative effect on an unrelated third party.

But this outcome may be inefficient since when all spend more, each candidate's probability of success remains unchanged.  All may agree that some form of collective restraint on expenditure would be useful.\"<ref name=\"FrankPositional\"/>\n\nFrank notes that treating positional externalities like other externalities might lead to \"intrusive economic and social regulation.\"<ref name=\"FrankPositional\"/> He argues, however, that less intrusive and more efficient means of \"limiting the costs of [[expenditure cascades]]\"\u2014i.e., the hypothesized increase in spending of middle-income families beyond their means \"because of indirect effects associated with increased spending by top earners\"\u2014exist; one such method is the [[personal income tax]].<ref name=\"FrankPositional\"/>\n\n===Inframarginal===\nInframarginal externalities are externalities in which there is no benefit or loss to the marginal consumer.  In other words, people neither gain nor lose anything at the margin, but benefits and costs do exist for those consumers within the given inframarginal range.\n\n===Technological===\nTechnological externalities directly affect a firm's production and therefore, indirectly influence an individual's consumption; and the overall impact of society; for example [[Open-source software]] or [[free software]] development by corporations.\n\n==Supply and demand diagram==\nThe usual economic analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a standard [[supply and demand]] diagram if the externality can be valued in terms of [[money]]. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the ''private cost'' that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the ''true'' cost that society as a whole pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal [[social cost]]. Similarly, there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as [[effective demand]] in the market.\n\nWhat curve is added depends on the type of externality that is described, but not whether it is positive or negative. Whenever an externality arises on the production side, there will be two supply curves (private and social cost). However, if the externality arises on the consumption side, there will be two demand curves instead (private and social benefit). This distinction is essential when it comes to resolving inefficiencies that are caused by externalities.\n\n===External costs===\n[[File:Negative externality.svg|384px|right|thumb|Demand curve with external costs; if social costs are not accounted for price is too low to cover all costs and hence quantity produced is unnecessarily high (because the producers of the good and their customers are essentially underpaying the total, real [[factors of production]].)]]\nThe graph shows the effects of a negative externality. For example, the [[steel industry]] is assumed to be selling in a competitive market \u2013 before pollution-control laws were imposed and enforced (e.g. under [[laissez-faire]]). The marginal private cost is less than the marginal social or public cost by the amount of the external cost, i.e., the cost of [[air pollution]] and [[water pollution]]. This is represented by the vertical distance between the two supply curves. It is assumed that there are no external benefits, so that social benefit ''equals'' individual benefit.\n\nIf the consumers only take into account their own private cost, they will end up at price '''P<sub>p</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''', instead of the more efficient price '''P<sub>s</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>s</sub>'''. These latter reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased ''only'' as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a [[free market]] is ''[[inefficiency|inefficient]]'' since at the quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''', the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole would be better off if the goods between '''Q<sub>p</sub>''' and '''Q<sub>s</sub>''' had not been produced. The problem is that people are buying and consuming ''too much'' steel.\n\nThis discussion implies that negative externalities (such as pollution) are ''more than'' merely an ethical problem. The problem is one of the disjunctures between marginal private and social costs that are not solved by the [[free market]]. It is a problem of societal communication and coordination to balance costs and benefits. This also implies that pollution is not something solved by competitive markets. Some ''collective'' solution is needed, such as a court system to allow parties affected by the pollution to be compensated, government intervention banning or discouraging pollution, or economic incentives such as [[green tax]]es.\n\n===External benefits===\n[[File:Positive externality.svg|384px|right|thumb|Supply curve with external benefits; when the market does not account for the additional social benefits of a good both the price for the good and the quantity produced are lower than the market could bear.]]\nThe graph shows the effects of a positive or beneficial externality. For example, the industry supplying smallpox vaccinations is assumed to be selling in a competitive market.  The marginal private benefit of getting the vaccination is less than the marginal social or public benefit by the amount of the external benefit (for example, society as a whole is increasingly protected from smallpox by each vaccination, including those who refuse to participate). This marginal external benefit of getting a smallpox shot is represented by the vertical distance between the two demand curves. Assume there are no external costs, so that social cost ''equals'' individual cost.\n\nIf consumers only take into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price '''P<sub>p</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''' as before, instead of the more efficient price '''P<sub>s</sub>''' and quantity '''Q<sub>s</sub>'''. This latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an [[free market|unfettered market]] is ''[[inefficiency|inefficient]]'' since at the quantity '''Q<sub>p</sub>''', the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying ''too few'' vaccinations.\n\nThe issue of external benefits is related to that of [[public goods]], which are goods where it is difficult if not impossible to exclude people from benefits. The production of a public good has beneficial externalities for all, or almost all, of the public. As with external costs, there is a problem here of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This also implies that vaccination is not something solved by competitive markets. The government may have to step in with a collective solution, such as subsidizing or legally requiring vaccine use. If the government does this, the good is called a [[merit good]].

While property rights to some things, such as objects, land, and money can be easily defined and protected, air, water, and wild animals often flow freely across personal and political borders, making it much more difficult to assign ownership. This incentivizes agents to consume them without paying the full cost, leading to negative externalities. Positive externalities similarly accrue from poorly defined property rights. For example, a person who gets a flu vaccination cannot own part of the [[herd immunity]] this confers on society, so they may choose not to be vaccinated.\n\n==Possible solutions==\n===Solutions in non-market economies===\n\n*In a gift economy, people are expected to consume what they are given. If they consume a gift which they value less than somebody else, that other person who cannot consume it is harmed, an externality. A market system will reduce this kind of externality because the person who values it less is more likely to trade it away and the person who values it more is more likely to trade for it.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Solutions in market economies===\nThere are several general types of solutions to the problem of externalities, including both public- and private-sector resolutions:\n* [[Corporations]] or [[partnerships]] will allow confidential sharing of information among members, reducing the positive externalities that would occur if the information were shared in an economy consisting only of individuals. \n* [[Pigovian tax]]es or [[subsidies]] intended to redress economic injustices or imbalances.\n* [[Regulation]] to limit activity that might cause negative externalities\n* [[Government provision]] of services with positive externalities\n* [[Lawsuit]]s to compensate affected parties for negative externalities\n* [[Mediation]] or negotiation between those affected by externalities and those causing them\n\nA Pigovian tax (also called Pigouvian tax, after economist Arthur C. Pigou) is a tax imposed that is equal in value to the negative externality. The result is that the market outcome would be reduced to the efficient amount. A side effect is that revenue is raised for the government, reducing the amount of [[Distortion (economics)|distortionary]] taxes that the government must impose elsewhere.  Governments justify the use of Pigovian taxes saying that these taxes help the market reach an efficient outcome because this tax bridges the gap between marginal social costs and marginal private costs.<ref>Barthold, Thomas A. (1994). \"Issues in the Design of Excise Tax.\" ''Journal of Economic Perspectives.'' 133\u201351.</ref>\n\nSome arguments against Pigovian taxes say that the tax does not account for all the transfers and regulations involved with an externality. In other words, the tax only considers the amount of externality produced.<ref>Nye, John (2008). \"The Pigou Problem.\" ''The Cato Institute.'' 32\u201336.</ref> Another argument against the tax is that it does not take private property into consideration.  Under the Pigovian system, one firm, for example, can be taxed more than another firm, even though the other firm is actually producing greater amounts of the negative externality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=A. H. |last2=Yandle |first2=Bruce |title=The end of the externality revolution |journal=Social Philosophy and Policy |date=24 June 2009 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=130\u201350 |doi=10.1017/S0265052509090190 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the most common type of solution is a tacit agreement through the political process.  Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests.  Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm.  These laws and regulations can take the form of \"command and control\" regulation (such as setting standards, targets, or [[process requirements]]), or [[environmental pricing reform]] (such as [[ecotax]]es or other [[Pigovian tax]]es, [[pollution market|tradable pollution permits]] or the creation of markets for ecological services). The second type of resolution is a purely private agreement between the parties involved.\n\nGovernment intervention might not always be needed. Traditional ways of life may have evolved as ways to deal with external costs and benefits. Alternatively, democratically run communities can agree to deal with these costs and benefits in an amicable way. Externalities can sometimes be resolved by agreement between the parties involved. This resolution may even come about because of the threat of government action.\n\nThe private-sector may sometimes be able to drive society to the socially optimal resolution. [[Ronald Coase]] argued that an efficient outcome can sometimes be reached without government intervention. Some take this argument further, and make the political claim that government should restrict its role to facilitating bargaining among the affected groups or individuals and to enforcing any contracts that result.\n\nThis result, often known as the [[Coase theorem]], requires that\n* Property rights be well-defined\n* People act rationally\n* [[Transaction costs]] be minimal (costless bargaining)\n* [[Complete information]]\nIf all of these conditions apply, the private parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities. The second part of the [[Coase theorem]] asserts that, when these conditions hold, whoever holds the property rights, a [[Pareto efficient]] outcome will be reached through bargaining.\n\nThis theorem would not apply to the steel industry case discussed above. For example, with a steel factory that trespasses on the lungs of a large number of individuals with pollution, it is difficult if not impossible for any one person to negotiate with the producer, and there are large transaction costs. Hence the most common approach may be to regulate the firm (by imposing limits on the amount of pollution considered \"acceptable\") while paying for the regulation and enforcement with [[taxes]]. The case of the vaccinations would also not satisfy the requirements of the Coase theorem. Since the potential external beneficiaries of vaccination are the people themselves, the people would have to self-organize to pay each other to be vaccinated. But such an organization that involves the entire populace would be indistinguishable from government action.\n\nIn some cases, the Coase theorem is relevant. For example, if a [[logging|logger]] is planning to clear-cut a [[forest]] in a way that has a negative impact on a nearby [[resort]], the resort-owner and the logger could, in theory, get together to agree to a deal. For example, the resort-owner could pay the logger not to clear-cut \u2013 or could buy the forest. The most problematic situation, from Coase's perspective, occurs when the forest literally does not belong to anyone, or in any example in which there are not well-defined and enforceable property rights; the question of \"who\" owns the forest is not important, as any specific owner will have an interest in coming to an agreement with the resort owner (if such an agreement is mutually beneficial).\n\nHowever, the Coase theorem is difficult to implement because Coase does not offer a negotiation method.<ref>Varian, Hal (1994). \"A Solution to the Problem of Externalities When Agents Are Well Informed.\" ''The [[American Economic Review]].'' Vol. 84 No. 5.</ref> Moreover, Coasian solutions are unlikely to be reached due to the possibility of running into the [[assignment problem]], the [[holdout problem]], the [[free-rider problem]], or [[transaction cost]]s. Additionally, firms could potentially bribe each other since there is little to no government interaction under the Coase theorem.<ref>Marney, G.A. (1971). \"The \u2018Coase Theorem:' A Reexamination.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Economics.''Vol. 85 No. 4. 718\u201323.</ref> For example, if one oil firm has a high pollution rate and its neighboring firm is bothered by the pollution, then the latter firm may move depending on incentives. Thus, if the oil firm were to bribe the second firm, the first oil firm would suffer no negative consequences because the government would not know about the bribing.\n\nIn a dynamic setup, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have shown that the impossibility to rule out Coasean bargaining tomorrow may actually justify Pigouvian intervention today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2007|title=Can Coasean Bargaining Justify Pigouvian Taxation?|journal=Economica|language=en|volume=74|issue=296|pages=573\u2013585|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x|issn=0013-0427|hdl=10419/22952}}</ref> To see this, note that unrestrained bargaining in the future may lead to an underinvestment problem (the so-called [[hold-up problem]]).
