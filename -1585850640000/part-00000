It is part of [[Loudoun County Public Schools]] and is at 340 North Maple Avenue in the town of Purcellville. Before the opening of Woodgrove High School in 2010, it was the sole high school for the western half of Loudoun County (which includes [[Purcellville]], [[Hamilton, Loudoun County, Virginia|Hamilton]], [[Round Hill, Loudoun County, Virginia|Round Hill]], [[Lovettsville, Virginia|Lovettsville]], [[Hillsboro, Loudoun County, Virginia|Hillsboro]], [[Middleburg, Virginia|Middleburg]], [[Philomont, Virginia|Philomont]] and [[Bluemont, Virginia|Bluemont]]).\n\n==History==\nLoudoun Valley opened in 1962. Throughout its history, Valley has remained a predominantly rural high school, maintained a small enrollment of roughly 800 students, and did not experience much of the sprawl that eastern Loudoun County experienced in the 1980s and 1990s. Until the 1999-2000 school year, Valley was the smallest high school in Loudoun County.\n\nRecently, due to immigration, Valley has begun to experience a high rate of growth similar to eastern Loudoun schools like [[Park View High School (Sterling, Virginia)|Park View]] and [[Broad Run High School|Broad Run]]. In 2002, [[Harmony Intermediate School]] opened as a school for 8th and 9th graders, making Valley a 10th-12th grade school. By the 2005-2006 school year, Valley had become the largest Loudoun County high school with 1,955 students. Valley had extreme overcrowding until a new western Loudoun County high school, [[Woodgrove High School]], opened in September 2010. \n\nAt this time, Loudoun Valley returned to having 9th-12th grades, and [[Harmony Intermediate School]] became Harmony Middle School, with 6th-8th grades. Loudoun Valley graduated its largest class in its \u2014 as well as in the county's \u2014 history in 2011,  graduating 558 students.\n\nThe current principal is Susan Ross. Ross was at the center of controversy in regards to grade tampering and grade inflation during the 2013 - 2014 academic school year after an article was posted in the [[Leesburg Today]], and subsequently picked up by the [[Loudoun Times-Mirror|Loudoun Times Mirror]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/hatrick-too-early-to-say-what-is-fact-and-what/article_497e59c4-da71-59dc-9835-0f872dfbcf7c.html|title=Hatrick: 'Too early to say what is fact and what is fiction'|last=Sharbel|first=Andrew|work=LoudounTimes.com|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}</ref> and [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/loudoun-valley-high-school-administration-under-investigation/2013/10/30/15981f90-4190-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|title=Loudoun Valley High School administration under investigation|last=Gibson|first=Caitlin|date=2013-10-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>, claiming that teachers felt bullied and harassed into inflating grades.\n\nAs of May 2019, the reputation of Ross has seen further decline, with local parents protesting outside of the school and creating an online petition calling for her removal as the principal of Loudoun Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/parents-protest-outside-loudoun-valley-high-school-call-for-principal/article_ba2ea6de-826a-11e9-bd04-fb1f72f81a59.html|title=Parents protest outside Loudoun Valley High School, call for principal's removal|last=kgraham@loudountimes.com|first=Karen Graham|website=LoudounTimes.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Accreditation and test scores==\n\n===Accreditation===\n[[Image:Valley grad 2010.jpg|Graduation|thumb]]\nLoudoun Valley High School is a fully accredited high school under the [[Virginia Department of Education]]'s [[Standards of Learning]] tests.\n\n===SAT scores===\nLoudoun Valley regularly scores above the national average and the statewide average.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Mathematics''' || '''Critical Reading''' || '''Writing''' || '''Total'''\n|-\n| 2000\u20132001 || 533 || 544 || n/a || 1,077\n|-\n| 2001\u20132002 || 529 || 540 || n/a || 1,069\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 537 || 551 || n/a || 1,088\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 549 || 557 || n/a || 1,106\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 553 || 559 || n/a || 1,112\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 535 || 544 || 529 || 1,608 (1,079 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 546 || 553 || 538 || 1,637 (1,099 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 552 || 551 || 539 || 1,642 (1,103 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 542 || 554 || 543 || 1,638 (1,096 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2012\u20132013 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2013\u20132014 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2014\u20132015 || 539 || 546 || 537 || 1,622 (1,085 M & CR)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001233104/http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Enrollment history==\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Number of Students''' \n|-\n| 1995\u20131996 || 1,012\n|- \n| 1996\u20131997 || 1,076\n|- \n| 1997\u20131998 || 1,147\n|- \n| 1998\u20131999 || 1,214\n|- \n| 1999\u20132000 || 1,320\n|- \n| 2000\u20132001 || 1,402\n|- \n| 2001\u20132002 || 1,503\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 1,588 (1,172 HS)\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 1,682 (1,225 HS)\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 1,817 (1,322 HS)\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 1,955 (1,440 HS)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 2,043 (1,513 HS)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 2,163 (1,637 HS)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 2,175\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || 1,331\n|}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LVathleticlogo.jpg|left|100px|Loudoun Valley's athletic logo. |thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 15 July 2007}}]] -->\nThe [[mascot]] is a [[Viking]], and the sports teams play in the [[Dulles District]] during regular season play, and [[4A Conference 21B]] and 4A West Region post-season.\n\n===District and region affiliations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The percussion and color guard also compete in AIA Indoor Percussion during the winter and spring months.\n\nThe Loudoun Valley High School  cross country team was ranked #1 in the country coming into the 2017 cross country season. They were undefeated all season and won their state meet with a perfect 15 points. They went on eventually to win the Nike Cross Nationals XC Meet with an all time low of 89 points.

Fellow Loudoun County school Stone Bridge also joined Group AAA in 2005, however, and rivalries have intensified between the two schools in many sports \u2014 such as football, volleyball, and softball \u2014 where both schools have strong programs.\n\nWith the opening of Woodgrove High School as the second Western Loudoun school in the 2010-2011 year, Valley and Woodgrove will play annually for the Western Cup.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification controversy (2005-2007 playing cycle)===\nBefore the 2005-2006 to 2006-2007 redistricting cycle, Valley was determined to be in Group AAA and was expected to join the Northern Region with fellow district member Stone Bridge. They met very strong resistance with member schools. After several heated debates, Stone Bridge joined the [[AAA Liberty District|Liberty District]] and Valley to the National District as a tournament-only member. The move was highly controversial among the National District's membership, because they were on an average of 50 miles or more from Valley. This was remedied with Valley's reassignment to the Cedar Run District and Northwest Region in 2007, which was welcomed by most Northern Region members.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification (2013-2015 playing cycle)===\nBefore 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] assigned teams to local districts, regions, and one of three state groups: A for small schools, AA for medium schools, and AAA for large schools. The districts were used for regular season play and the first round of post-season playoffs. In 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] reclassified the system so that there were six state groups, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A, with the smallest being 1A and the largest being 6A.\n\nThey switched from geographically located districts to school size based conferences for post-season playoffs, keeping the districts for regular season play. As part of this transition, Loudoun Valley was moved from state group AAA to 3A, remained in the [[Dulles District]], and joined Conference 28. Loudoun Valley was later bumped up to state group 4A and joined Conference 21B in 2015.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Mark Herring]], 48th Attorney General of Virginia<ref>{{cite news |url=https://loudounnow.com/2018/02/01/the-real-deal-as-herrings-profile-rises-loudouns-homegrown-ag-stays-in-touch-with-his-roots/ |title=As Herring's Profile Rises, Loudoun's Homegrown AG Stays in Touch with His Roots |first=Jan |last=Mercker |date=February 1, 2018 |newspaper=Loudoun Now}}</ref>\n*[[Drew Hunter]] (Class of 2016), signed a 10 year contract with Adidas to run professional track, high school record holder for the indoor mile, 1500m run and 3000m run, Footlocker National Cross Country Champion - 2015  <ref>{{cite web |title=Loudoun Valley's Drew Hunter named Gatorade National Cross-Country Runner of the Year |website=AllMetSports |publisher=Washington Post |first=Jacob |last=Emert |date=February 24, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2016/02/24/loudoun-valleys-drew-hunter-named-gatorade-national-cross-country-runner-of-the-year/}}</ref>\n*[[Rob Jones (Marine)|Rob Jones]] (Class of 2003), United States Marine and athlete<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/10/19/31-marathons-31-days-31-cities-after-losing-both-legs-in-afghanistan-hes-running-to-inspire/ |title=31 marathons, 31 days, 31 cities: After losing both legs in Afghanistan, he\u2019s running to inspire |website=D.C.

Ross was at the center of controversy in regards to grade tampering and grade inflation during the 2013 - 2014 academic school year after an article was posted in the [[Leesburg Today]], and subsequently picked up by the [[Loudoun Times-Mirror|Loudoun Times Mirror]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/hatrick-too-early-to-say-what-is-fact-and-what/article_497e59c4-da71-59dc-9835-0f872dfbcf7c.html|title=Hatrick: 'Too early to say what is fact and what is fiction'|last=Sharbel|first=Andrew|work=LoudounTimes.com|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}</ref> and [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/loudoun-valley-high-school-administration-under-investigation/2013/10/30/15981f90-4190-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html|title=Loudoun Valley High School administration under investigation|last=Gibson|first=Caitlin|date=2013-10-30|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>, claiming that teachers felt bullied and harassed into inflating grades.\n\nAs of May 2019, the reputation of Ross has seen further decline, with local parents protesting outside of the school and creating an online petition calling for her removal as the principal of Loudoun Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudountimes.com/news/parents-protest-outside-loudoun-valley-high-school-call-for-principal/article_ba2ea6de-826a-11e9-bd04-fb1f72f81a59.html|title=Parents protest outside Loudoun Valley High School, call for principal's removal|last=kgraham@loudountimes.com|first=Karen Graham|website=LoudounTimes.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Accreditation and test scores==\n\n===Accreditation===\n[[Image:Valley grad 2010.jpg|Graduation|thumb]]\nLoudoun Valley High School is a fully accredited high school under the [[Virginia Department of Education]]'s [[Standards of Learning]] tests.\n\n===SAT scores===\nLoudoun Valley regularly scores above the national average and the statewide average.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Mathematics''' || '''Critical Reading''' || '''Writing''' || '''Total'''\n|-\n| 2000\u20132001 || 533 || 544 || n/a || 1,077\n|-\n| 2001\u20132002 || 529 || 540 || n/a || 1,069\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 537 || 551 || n/a || 1,088\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 549 || 557 || n/a || 1,106\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 553 || 559 || n/a || 1,112\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 535 || 544 || 529 || 1,608 (1,079 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 546 || 553 || 538 || 1,637 (1,099 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 552 || 551 || 539 || 1,642 (1,103 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 542 || 554 || 543 || 1,638 (1,096 M & CR)\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2012\u20132013 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2013\u20132014 || n/a || n/a || n/a || n/a\n|-\n| 2014\u20132015 || 539 || 546 || 537 || 1,622 (1,085 M & CR)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001233104/http://www.vivaloudoun.com/lcps-hold-steady-on-sat-scores/ |archivedate=2016-10-01 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Enrollment history==\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n| '''School Year''' || '''Number of Students''' \n|-\n| 1995\u20131996 || 1,012\n|- \n| 1996\u20131997 || 1,076\n|- \n| 1997\u20131998 || 1,147\n|- \n| 1998\u20131999 || 1,214\n|- \n| 1999\u20132000 || 1,320\n|- \n| 2000\u20132001 || 1,402\n|- \n| 2001\u20132002 || 1,503\n|- \n| 2002\u20132003 || 1,588 (1,172 HS)\n|-  \n| 2003\u20132004 || 1,682 (1,225 HS)\n|- \n| 2004\u20132005 || 1,817 (1,322 HS)\n|- \n| 2005\u20132006 || 1,955 (1,440 HS)\n|-\n| 2006\u20132007 || 2,043 (1,513 HS)\n|-\n| 2007\u20132008 || 2,163 (1,637 HS)\n|-\n| 2008\u20132009 || 2,175\n|-\n| 2009\u20132010 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2010\u20132011 || 1,659\n|-\n| 2011\u20132012 || 1,331\n|}\n\n==Athletics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LVathleticlogo.jpg|left|100px|Loudoun Valley's athletic logo. |thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 15 July 2007}}]] -->\nThe [[mascot]] is a [[Viking]], and the sports teams play in the [[Dulles District]] during regular season play, and [[4A Conference 21B]] and 4A West Region post-season.\n\n===District and region affiliations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Fellow Loudoun County school Stone Bridge also joined Group AAA in 2005, however, and rivalries have intensified between the two schools in many sports \u2014 such as football, volleyball, and softball \u2014 where both schools have strong programs.\n\nWith the opening of Woodgrove High School as the second Western Loudoun school in the 2010-2011 year, Valley and Woodgrove will play annually for the Western Cup.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification controversy (2005-2007 playing cycle)===\nBefore the 2005-2006 to 2006-2007 redistricting cycle, Valley was determined to be in Group AAA and was expected to join the Northern Region with fellow district member Stone Bridge. They met very strong resistance with member schools. After several heated debates, Stone Bridge joined the [[AAA Liberty District|Liberty District]] and Valley to the National District as a tournament-only member. The move was highly controversial among the National District's membership, because they were on an average of 50 miles or more from Valley. This was remedied with Valley's reassignment to the Cedar Run District and Northwest Region in 2007, which was welcomed by most Northern Region members.\n\n===Redistricting and reclassification (2013-2015 playing cycle)===\nBefore 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] assigned teams to local districts, regions, and one of three state groups: A for small schools, AA for medium schools, and AAA for large schools. The districts were used for regular season play and the first round of post-season playoffs. In 2013, the [[Virginia High School League]] reclassified the system so that there were six state groups, 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A, with the smallest being 1A and the largest being 6A.\n\nThey switched from geographically located districts to school size based conferences for post-season playoffs, keeping the districts for regular season play. As part of this transition, Loudoun Valley was moved from state group AAA to 3A, remained in the [[Dulles District]], and joined Conference 28. Loudoun Valley was later bumped up to state group 4A and joined Conference 21B in 2015.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Blair Brown Lipsit]], volleyball player for Penn State who won four consecutive NCAA National Championships  [[2007 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2007]], [[2008 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2008]], [[2009 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2009]], and [[2010 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2010]].\n*[[Mark Herring]], 48th Attorney General of Virginia<ref>{{cite news |url=https://loudounnow.com/2018/02/01/the-real-deal-as-herrings-profile-rises-loudouns-homegrown-ag-stays-in-touch-with-his-roots/ |title=As Herring's Profile Rises, Loudoun's Homegrown AG Stays in Touch with His Roots |first=Jan |last=Mercker |date=February 1, 2018 |newspaper=Loudoun Now}}</ref>\n*[[Drew Hunter]] (Class of 2016), signed a 10 year contract with Adidas to run professional track, high school record holder for the indoor mile, 1500m run and 3000m run, Footlocker National Cross Country Champion - 2015  <ref>{{cite web |title=Loudoun Valley's Drew Hunter named Gatorade National Cross-Country Runner of the Year |website=AllMetSports |publisher=Washington Post |first=Jacob |last=Emert |date=February 24, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2016/02/24/loudoun-valleys-drew-hunter-named-gatorade-national-cross-country-runner-of-the-year/}}</ref>\n*[[Rob Jones (Marine)|Rob Jones]] (Class of 2003), United States Marine and athlete<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/10/19/31-marathons-31-days-31-cities-after-losing-both-legs-in-afghanistan-hes-running-to-inspire/ |title=31 marathons, 31 days, 31 cities: After losing both legs in Afghanistan, he\u2019s running to inspire |website=D.C.

She originally had black hair, though when [[Papa Smurf]] made her good, her hair became blond. Before the smurflings created Sassette, Smurfette was the only female smurf in the Smurf village. Most of the time Smurfette is portrayed as an object of admiration of many other Smurfs, since she is the only female Smurf constantly in the village. She is usually hopeless in times of danger and sometimes thinks she knows it all, yet has a caring side as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2.

The Smurfs turn to Papa Smurf when things go wrong. Papa Smurf is skilled in making magical spells and potions. He is much older than the other Smurfs (except for Grandpa and Nanny, who are older than Papa). Papa Smurf often serves the other Smurfs with his knowledge and wisdom and usually devises a plan for how to get out of trouble or to save the Smurf village from attacks by Gargamel. Unlike the other male Smurfs, Papa Smurf's trousers and hat are red instead of white.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3.

He also has a tattoo on his right arm (or sometimes both of his arms) of a red heart with an arrow through it. His favorite activity is lifting weights and doing other forms of exercise, and is often the one to kick Brainy out of the village whenever he is boasting. Hefty takes pride in being tough, sometimes doing it just for attention.\n\nPapa appoints Hefty as the leader of the Smurfs in season 3: Handy's Kite. In several episodes, Papa selects Hefty and Handy as leaders of separate teams in dangerous missions (season 1: Smurfette's Dancing Shoes; season 4: Hopping Cough Smurfs).\n\nIn ''The Lost Village'', he is one of the four main Smurf protagonists and is in love with Smurfette. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4.

He can be distinguished from the others by the large glasses he wears. He also has archived his self-perceived wit and wisdom in several volumes of books entitled \"The Quotations of Brainy Smurf\". The Smurfs most often respond to his self-righteous preaching by either tossing him out of the village, clobbering him with a club (usually off screen) or simply ignoring him. His vices aside, Brainy is a good, loyal Smurf who can be counted on when the need arises, and more than once \u2013 without thinking about it \u2013 ends up doing the right thing. His original name translates to \"Smurf with Glasses\".\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 5. '''''Grouchy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Grognon\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] (Cartoon)<br>[[George Lopez]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Jake Johnson]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Grouchy Smurf is the [[misanthrope|misanthropic]] grouch of the Smurf village. His catchphrase is \"I hate (something somebody else mentions)\" yet it is shown during the show that he is a good observer and notices kindness in others even if he is not playing active role in an event. Even though Grouchy Smurf portrays a role of a moaner within the group, he mostly wishes others to be happy and successful in order to get out of a problematic situation. Grouchy usually has a scowl on his face. In the comics version he was originally a normal Smurf, changed only when bitten by a Bzz fly in the comic story \"The Black Smurfs\" (adapted into English as \"The Purple Smurfs\").\n\nIn the cartoon version, he seems to have always have been a grouch. Despite his grouchiness, he has a soft spot for Baby Smurf and the Smurflings.\n\nIn the movie, his grouchiness is implied to be from insecurity.\n\nIn Movie 2, he tries to become Positive Smurf, but bad things keep happening to him.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6.

He has an exceptional interest in eating cakes and other pastry.

In Volume 23, ''Schtroumpf Gourmand'' is shown wearing the normal Smurf outfit (like he has in all other volumes) and ''Schtroumpf Cuisinier'' again wearing the chef outfit, so Volume 12 may have just been a mistake.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.

Azrael shares Gargamel's distinctive laugh. Azrael was originally female in the comic books, but was changed to a male in the cartoon show and returned as a male in later comics and in the movies. In one episode of the series, Azrael got so tired of Gargamel treating him cruelly that he turned against his master.\nHowever, in the movies, he still remains loyal to Gargamel, although he laughs at his master whenever he gets humiliated or hurt.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Hogatha Griffin The Evil Witch'''''\n| Hogatha\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| [[Janet Waldo]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Hogatha is a character who was created for the television cartoon series, but has appeared in at least one of the comics for the magazine, which has often borrowed stories from episodes of the show. She is an evil, ugly [[Witchcraft|witch]] who uses her magic to lure unsuspecting suitors and occasionally cause trouble for the Smurfs. Hogatha snorts loudly with her large wart-covered nose. She thinks she is beautiful, although she is actually quite ugly and wears a red wig to cover her baldness. She rides on a long-suffering vulture whose name tends to vary from one episode to another, but the most frequent one is Harold. She and Gargamel dislike each other, and she often refers to him as \"Garglesmell\". Hogatha used a spell to disguise herself as a Smurf who constantly snorts and causes trouble, under the name '''Snorty Smurf''', in the first-season episode of the TV series \"The Fake Smurf\" (in the book version of the story, Gargamel is the one who changes himself into a Smurf). Regardless of being somehow vain at times during the show, Hogatha seeks to achieve acceptance from others and actively seeks love, showing a good side of her nature.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Lord Balthazar'''''\n| Lord Balthazar\n| Cartoon\n| [[Keene Curtis]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Lord Balthazar is Gargamel's [[godparent|godfather]].

A nasty, irredeemable woman as ugly as she is evil, she lives in a gloomy castle all alone, except for an unnamed talking pet toucan and a manservant named Reeves who also drives her carriage. Her backstory was revealed in a number of episodes. In season 3's \"The Tears of a Smurf,\" it is revealed she once married a nobleman, by whom she had a daughter named Priscilla. Chlorhydris then became insanely jealous over her husband loving her daughter more than he loved her. She caused her husband's disappearance and Priscilla, who was just a toddler at that time, grew up in a castle without love. Enraged when a young prince fell in love with her daughter, Chlorhydris used her malignant magic to cause the young man to also disappear and put a curse of ugliness on Priscilla to keep anyone else from falling in love with her. In the season 7 episode \"Chlorhydris' Lost Love,\" it is revealed that she was once kind and caring, but became hateful when her true love was stolen away from her.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Nemesis'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n|[[Frank Welker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Nemesis is a sinister, hiccupping creature shrouded in a purple robe. He is an evil wizard like Gargamel, only much more powerful. He is constantly trying to steal the Long-Life Stone, which is the magical artifact that grants the Smurfs their extremely long lifespans. He was once a human but after a magical accident, he became so grotesque that people were horrified at the sight of his face, so he kept his hood over it.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Scruple'''''\n| Scrupule\n| Cartoon\n| [[Brenda Vaccaro]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Scruple is Gargamel's nephew and apprentice. Scruple was expelled from a school for wizards and lives with his uncle Gargamel as kind of an indentured servant, even though neither one enjoys being with the other.

He shows his uncle little respect, often calling him \"Gargie\" to his face.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Count Gregorian'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Paul Winchell]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Count Gregorian is an evil wizard who only appeared in the Season 2 episode \"The Raven Wizard\". He was originally thought to be Princess Sabina's new [[tutor]], but it was revealed that he was the legendary Raven Wizard, cursed with the head of a [[raven]] when the temporary spell to restore his human head wore off. He kidnapped Sabina, whose beauty he needed to restore his human face with the aid of a magical gem called the Heart Diamond, even though she would be drained of her life's energy as a result. He failed when Johan and Peewit entered his castle, the latter causing the Heart Diamond to explode, turning the wizard completely into a ravenr. He is similar in trait to Gargamel in that they are both evil wizards and were voiced by Paul Winchell.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Mordain'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Paul Winchell]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Mordain is an evil court wizard who solely appears in the Season 2 episode \"The Good, The Bad and The Smurfy\". He captured Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Clumsy Smurf and Brainy Smurf to entertain his master King Argon and his knights on the king's birthday. He then turned them into frogs so that he could steal the king's gold. When the other Smurfs entered the castle to free the captured Smurfs, Papa Smurf turned him into a frog, where he now spends his days eating flies, and turned King Argon and the knights back to normal. He is similar in trait to Gargamel and Count Gregorian in that they are evil wizards and voiced by Paul Winchell (though Count Gregorian and Mordain are not actually related to Gargamel).\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Lady Imperia'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" |The evil aunt and guardian of the boy Prince/King Gerard, Lady Imperia appears only in the Season 1 cartoon episode \"The Clockwork Smurf\", in which she and her henchman Thorick have locked her nephew up in a dungeon cell, pretending to his subjects that he is ill and has to be isolated, giving her the excuse to rule in his place as [[regent]]. She plans to eventually give the false news that Gerard is dead so that she can rule permanently, leaving her nephew to rot in his cell. The Smurfs and Clockwork Smurf help Gerard to escape and expose her and she is banished from the kingdom, never to return. Although other equally evil relatives of Gerard, namely his uncle Sir Leopold in \"Return of the Clockwork Smurf\" and his cousin Malcolm the Mean in \"The Noble Stag\", have tried to take the boy king's throne instead.\n|-\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''The Wartmongers'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Will Ryan]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The Wartmongers are little [[toad]]-like creatures who live in the muck and slime of Creepy Deepy Swamp and often cause the Smurfs problems. They consider having more warts than others as a source of pride. They like ripping the wings off of the Pussiwillow Pixies, and, like the Pixies, at first think that Smurfs are hairy, red-eyed monsters. The leader of the Wartmongers is '''King Bullrush''' (voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]) who commands his minions to do his bidding.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Evelyn'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Ruta Lee]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Evelyn is a glamorous but evil [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]] who only appears in the Smurfs television cartoon show episode \"Gargamel's Sweetheart\". She rides around in a carriage with her pet black [[weasel]] Satin, which she keeps draped around her shoulders like a fur stole, and she extorts people with her magic wand to surrender all their money or valuables. Gargamel falls in love with her and tries unsuccessfully to catch her interest by pretending to be a powerful, rich sorcerer. She does feign a mutual attraction to him when he claims he knows how to make gold, and agrees to help him catch Smurfs to do so. The Smurfs outsmart them though, and she ends up dropping both her pretense and Gargamel like a hot potato.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''\"Mummy\" (a.k.a.

She occasionally makes unannounced visits to her son, usually to berate him over his inability to catch the Smurfs. Also when she visits, she insists on doing the cooking at which she is terrible as both her son and Azrael can attest. She also hates cats and always throws Azrael out of Gargamel's hovel when she arrives to visit. On one occasion, she and Madame Lavinia tried to get Gargamel to be a suitor to a baron's daughter named Andiria. Due to the interference of the Smurfs as Gargamel keeps claiming, the baron called the wedding off. This caused Gargamel to be dealt with by his mother when they get home. When Madame Lavinia states that she still would like to be paid her commission for this involvement, Gargame's mother states that her son \"will pay.\"\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Corbelius'''''\n|\n| Comics\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Corbelius is a black crow who is Gargamel's other pet in the comics, appearing far less frequently than Azrael. He serves Gargamel primarily in delivering letters, usually threats or ransom demands to the Smurfs. Unlike Azrael, Corbelius does not seem to take any malicious pleasure in what he does; if anything, he seems indifferent.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Monty'''''\n|\n| Movie ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]''\n|| [[Dee Bradley Baker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Monty is a vulture-like bird who is Gargamel's other pet in the ''Lost Village'' movie. Monty seems to be Gargamel's favorite, even though he seems like a lesser intellect, which irritates Azrael to no end. Monty does have a mean streak and can get quite angry, but seems more content with being dopey. Monty bears an uncanny resemblance to the titular creature from the episode The Howlibird.\n|}\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Original French name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Appears in\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Voiced by\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''[[Johan and Peewit]]'''''\n| Johan et Pirlouit\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| Sir Johan: [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>Pewitt: [[Frank Welker]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Johan is a young human [[squire]] and [[Page (servant)|page boy]] of an unnamed king near the Smurf village.

It was in a ''Johan and Peewit'' adventure published in 1958 that the Smurfs were first introduced. The Smurfs would appear in some of the later adventures of Johan and Peewit, as well as their own series. In the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series during the second season, Johan and Peewit were occasionally featured in stories which focused on the pair and the kingdom they protected. Johan rides a white horse named Bayard, and Peewit rides a goat named Biquette (Nanny in ''The Smurfs and the Magic Flute''). In the cartoon, Peewit sings in an off-key voice and is always hungry.

He also frequently breaks into Gargamel's hovel and eats his food and also eats rocks (which he likes dipped in slime). He is friends with whoever may be offering him something in exchange. In other words, he will either help Gargamel or help the Smurfs, depending on who is offering more in return (usually food).

After being convinced that Smurfs are not actually hairy, red-eyed monsters as they had always believed, they befriended the Smurfs. They became friends because the Smurfs saved them from being turned into the Wartmongers' slaves and getting their wings ripped off. There are at least six that appear in the series: \n\n* Elderberry - The leader \n* Pansy - A clumsy pixie, who is good friends with Clumsy Smurf. \n* Lilac - A vain pixie with a Southern accent \n* Acorn - The youngest and the smallest, who was very jealous of Baby Smurf. \n* Bramble - The green pixie \n* Holly - The red-headed pixie, also sporting green. \n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''King Gerard'''''\n| Roi J\u00e9arard\n| Cartoon\n| [[Philip Proctor]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Gerard is a child prince who befriends the Smurfs before becoming king.

They are good friends with Papa Smurf, Homnibus, and Peewit. In one episode (\"Memory Melons\"), the Quarrels celebrate their 200th wedding anniversary, but their tendency to fight almost ruins the party, their home and the forest; however the Smurfs help them reconcile.

Flowerbell initially agrees, but grows to regret the deal, especially when Papa Smurf falls so seriously in love with her that he actually proposes marriage, despite misgivings from the other Smurfs. In the end, although Flowerbell does go through with the deal, she ends up rescuing Papa Smurf from Lord Balthazar with the help of the other Smurfs. Flowerbell also makes a cameo appearance in ''Smurfily Ever After'', as a guest at Woody and Laconia's wedding.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Melina'''''\n| Melina\n| Cartoon\n| N/A\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Like Brenda, Melina is a good little child witch who appears in a Season 7 episode of the cartoon series, \"Sassette's Bewitching Friendship\".

She originally had black hair, though when [[Papa Smurf]] made her good, her hair became blond. Before the smurflings created Sassette, Smurfette was the only female smurf in the Smurf village. Most of the time Smurfette is portrayed as an object of admiration of many other Smurfs, since she is the only female Smurf constantly in the village. She is usually hopeless in times of danger and sometimes thinks she knows it all, yet has a caring side as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2.

The Smurfs turn to Papa Smurf when things go wrong. Papa Smurf is skilled in making magical spells and potions. He is much older than the other Smurfs (except for Grandpa and Nanny, who are older than Papa). Papa Smurf often serves the other Smurfs with his knowledge and wisdom and usually devises a plan for how to get out of trouble or to save the Smurf village from attacks by Gargamel. Unlike the other male Smurfs, Papa Smurf's trousers and hat are red instead of white.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3.

He also has a tattoo on his right arm (or sometimes both of his arms) of a red heart with an arrow through it. His favorite activity is lifting weights and doing other forms of exercise, and is often the one to kick Brainy out of the village whenever he is boasting. Hefty takes pride in being tough, sometimes doing it just for attention.\n\nPapa appoints Hefty as the leader of the Smurfs in season 3: Handy's Kite. In several episodes, Papa selects Hefty and Handy as leaders of separate teams in dangerous missions (season 1: Smurfette's Dancing Shoes; season 4: Hopping Cough Smurfs).\n\nIn ''The Lost Village'', he is one of the four main Smurf protagonists and is in love with Smurfette. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4.

He can be distinguished from the others by the large glasses he wears. He also has archived his self-perceived wit and wisdom in several volumes of books entitled \"The Quotations of Brainy Smurf\". The Smurfs most often respond to his self-righteous preaching by either tossing him out of the village, clobbering him with a club (usually off screen) or simply ignoring him. His vices aside, Brainy is a good, loyal Smurf who can be counted on when the need arises, and more than once \u2013 without thinking about it \u2013 ends up doing the right thing. His original name translates to \"Smurf with Glasses\".\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 5.

His catchphrase is \"I hate (something somebody else mentions)\" yet it is shown during the show that he is a good observer and notices kindness in others even if he is not playing active role in an event. Even though Grouchy Smurf portrays a role of a moaner within the group, he mostly wishes others to be happy and successful in order to get out of a problematic situation. Grouchy usually has a scowl on his face. In the comics version he was originally a normal Smurf, changed only when bitten by a Bzz fly in the comic story \"The Black Smurfs\" (adapted into English as \"The Purple Smurfs\").\n\nIn the cartoon version, he seems to have always have been a grouch. Despite his grouchiness, he has a soft spot for Baby Smurf and the Smurflings.\n\nIn the movie, his grouchiness is implied to be from insecurity.\n\nIn Movie 2, he tries to become Positive Smurf, but bad things keep happening to him.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6. '''''Clumsy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Maladroit\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[William Callaway]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Anton Yelchin]] (Movie 1 and 2, CGI short films)<br>[[Jack McBrayer]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Clumsy Smurf is a somewhat dimwitted yet amiable Smurf. In some dangerous situations he is also revealed to be quite brave too. He is distinguished in the cartoon series by his baggy clothing (hat hanging over his eyebrows) which adds to his clumsy appearance (his clothing is normal in the comics).\n\nIn the animated series, Clumsy speaks in a variety of [[Southern American English]].\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 7. '''''Greedy Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Gourmand\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies 1 and 2\n| [[Hamilton Camp]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Kenan Thompson]] (Movie 1 and 2)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Greedy is an exceptionally gluttonous Smurf. He has an exceptional interest in eating cakes and other pastry. Greedy usually cannot seem to help himself and he is often chased by Chef Smurf for stealing snacks and food.\n\nIn the cartoon series, this character was combined with that of Chef Smurf, where he enjoys baking and cooking, but eventually ends up eating his own creations, hence the name. He wears a [[Chef's uniform|chef's toque and apron]] in the comics.\n\nIn the cartoon, instead of an apron he often wears a napkin around his neck.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8. '''''Jokey Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Farceur\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[June Foray]] (Cartoon)<br>[[Paul Reubens]] (Movies)<br>[[Gabriel Iglesias]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Jokey is the village prankster. In the TV cartoon series, Jokey Smurf almost always used the same form of \"joke\"; yellow- and red-wrapped present boxes that he offers to his victims, saying that it is a \"surprise\". When opened, the \"present\" box explodes with a sizable quantity of black smoke which blackens the receiver's face (or entire body depending on the explosion's size). Gargamel is naturally a favorite target, and Brainy is as well. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9. '''''Chef Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Cuisinier\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies 1 and 2\n| [[Wolfgang Puck]] (Movie)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Chef Smurf is the Smurf village's [[chef]]. He knows dozens of recipes and cooks many dishes. He always wears his toque blanche (white chef's hat). In the cartoon series, Chef Smurf and Greedy Smurf are combined into the same character. In Volume 11, a Smurf is called ''Schtroumpf Gourmand'', who looks just like ''Schtroumpf cuisinier'' (wearing a toque blanche, neckerchief and apron). In Volume 23, ''Schtroumpf Gourmand'' is shown wearing the normal Smurf outfit (like he has in all other volumes) and ''Schtroumpf Cuisinier'' again wearing the chef outfit, so Volume 12 may have just been a mistake.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10. '''''Vanity Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Coquet\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movies\n| [[Alan Oppenheimer]] (Cartoon)<br>[[John Oliver (entertainer)|John Oliver]] (Movie)<br>[[Tituss Burgess]] (''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Vanity Smurf is the epitome of a [[Narcissism|narcissist]]. He has a flower in his hat, and he often holds a hand mirror, staring into his own reflection, which he kisses often. He thinks he is the best-looking of all of the Smurfs.\n\nIn Movie 2, Vanity becomes Commando Smurf.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 11.

'''''Tracker Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Traqueur\n| Cartoon\n| [[Henry Polic II]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Tracker Smurf is a Smurf who is exclusive to the cartoon. He wears a small red feather in his cap and sometimes carries a walking stick. He is an excellent outdoorsman and [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]]. He also possesses an excellent sense of smell capable of locating [[truffles]] growing underground. In season 2: A Mere Truffle, he receives the Brainy treatment (thrown away or kicked away and lands on his head).\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 14.

His face is perpetually grimy, his hat is grubby and disheveled, and one of his loose stockings is perpetually torn, revealing his toes. Sloppy owns a pet fly named Fly, whom he sometimes walks on a leash and has taught to do tricks like a dog.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 15. '''''Harmony Smurf'''''\n| Schtroumpf Musicien\n| Comics + Cartoon\n|[[Hamilton Camp]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Harmony Smurf is a [[musician]] who especially loves to play the trumpet, although his musical ability shows a total lack of harmony (somewhat like the singing of a certain [[List of Asterix characters#Cacofonix|fictional Armorican bard]], or [[Johan and Peewit#Characters|Johan's blonde-haired, diminutive sidekick]]). Harmony is usually asked to stop playing his trumpet as soon as he gets started. Some English editions name him as Rocker Smurf.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 16.

Gargamel is absolutely obsessed with the Smurfs, and his main goal vacillates from trying to eat them to trying to capture them for use in a potion to [[Chrysopoeia|make gold]] to simply getting revenge.\n\nIn the cartoon TV shows, he attempts to eat The Smurfs and in the movies, his motive is to draw off their blue energy which will give him unlimited sorcerous powers.\n\nHis head is balding, his nose is protuberant, his black robe is worn and patched, and his teeth are rotten.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Azrael'''''\n| Azrael\n| Comics + Cartoon + Movie 1 and 2 + Spin-off Movie\n| [[Don Messick]] (Cartoon)<br>Mr. Krinkles the Cat (Movies 1 and 2)<br>[[Frank Welker]] (voice, Movies 1 and 2, CGI short films, ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Gargamel's pet cat.

Azrael tends to realize beforehand that Gargamel's schemes will go awry, but reluctantly goes along with them anyway in hopes of possibly capturing a Smurf to eat. Azrael shares Gargamel's distinctive laugh. Azrael was originally female in the comic books, but was changed to a male in the cartoon show and returned as a male in later comics and in the movies. In one episode of the series, Azrael got so tired of Gargamel treating him cruelly that he turned against his master.\nHowever, in the movies, he still remains loyal to Gargamel, although he laughs at his master whenever he gets humiliated or hurt.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Hogatha Griffin The Evil Witch'''''\n| Hogatha\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| [[Janet Waldo]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Hogatha is a character who was created for the television cartoon series, but has appeared in at least one of the comics for the magazine, which has often borrowed stories from episodes of the show. She is an evil, ugly [[Witchcraft|witch]] who uses her magic to lure unsuspecting suitors and occasionally cause trouble for the Smurfs. Hogatha snorts loudly with her large wart-covered nose. She thinks she is beautiful, although she is actually quite ugly and wears a red wig to cover her baldness. She rides on a long-suffering vulture whose name tends to vary from one episode to another, but the most frequent one is Harold. She and Gargamel dislike each other, and she often refers to him as \"Garglesmell\". Hogatha used a spell to disguise herself as a Smurf who constantly snorts and causes trouble, under the name '''Snorty Smurf''', in the first-season episode of the TV series \"The Fake Smurf\" (in the book version of the story, Gargamel is the one who changes himself into a Smurf). Regardless of being somehow vain at times during the show, Hogatha seeks to achieve acceptance from others and actively seeks love, showing a good side of her nature.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Lord Balthazar'''''\n| Lord Balthazar\n| Cartoon\n| [[Keene Curtis]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Lord Balthazar is Gargamel's [[godparent|godfather]].

A nasty, irredeemable woman as ugly as she is evil, she lives in a gloomy castle all alone, except for an unnamed talking pet toucan and a manservant named Reeves who also drives her carriage. Her backstory was revealed in a number of episodes. In season 3's \"The Tears of a Smurf,\" it is revealed she once married a nobleman, by whom she had a daughter named Priscilla. Chlorhydris then became insanely jealous over her husband loving her daughter more than he loved her. She caused her husband's disappearance and Priscilla, who was just a toddler at that time, grew up in a castle without love. Enraged when a young prince fell in love with her daughter, Chlorhydris used her malignant magic to cause the young man to also disappear and put a curse of ugliness on Priscilla to keep anyone else from falling in love with her. In the season 7 episode \"Chlorhydris' Lost Love,\" it is revealed that she was once kind and caring, but became hateful when her true love was stolen away from her.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Nemesis'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n|[[Frank Welker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Nemesis is a sinister, hiccupping creature shrouded in a purple robe. He is an evil wizard like Gargamel, only much more powerful. He is constantly trying to steal the Long-Life Stone, which is the magical artifact that grants the Smurfs their extremely long lifespans. He was once a human but after a magical accident, he became so grotesque that people were horrified at the sight of his face, so he kept his hood over it.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Scruple'''''\n| Scrupule\n| Cartoon\n| [[Brenda Vaccaro]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Scruple is Gargamel's nephew and apprentice. Scruple was expelled from a school for wizards and lives with his uncle Gargamel as kind of an indentured servant, even though neither one enjoys being with the other. Like Azrael, Scruple often sees the flaws in Gargamel's schemes and whenever he offers a suggestion, his uncle often accepts it as his own idea. He shows his uncle little respect, often calling him \"Gargie\" to his face.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Count Gregorian'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Paul Winchell]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Count Gregorian is an evil wizard who only appeared in the Season 2 episode \"The Raven Wizard\". He was originally thought to be Princess Sabina's new [[tutor]], but it was revealed that he was the legendary Raven Wizard, cursed with the head of a [[raven]] when the temporary spell to restore his human head wore off. He kidnapped Sabina, whose beauty he needed to restore his human face with the aid of a magical gem called the Heart Diamond, even though she would be drained of her life's energy as a result. He failed when Johan and Peewit entered his castle, the latter causing the Heart Diamond to explode, turning the wizard completely into a ravenr.

He captured Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Clumsy Smurf and Brainy Smurf to entertain his master King Argon and his knights on the king's birthday. He then turned them into frogs so that he could steal the king's gold. When the other Smurfs entered the castle to free the captured Smurfs, Papa Smurf turned him into a frog, where he now spends his days eating flies, and turned King Argon and the knights back to normal. He is similar in trait to Gargamel and Count Gregorian in that they are evil wizards and voiced by Paul Winchell (though Count Gregorian and Mordain are not actually related to Gargamel).\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Lady Imperia'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" |The evil aunt and guardian of the boy Prince/King Gerard, Lady Imperia appears only in the Season 1 cartoon episode \"The Clockwork Smurf\", in which she and her henchman Thorick have locked her nephew up in a dungeon cell, pretending to his subjects that he is ill and has to be isolated, giving her the excuse to rule in his place as [[regent]]. She plans to eventually give the false news that Gerard is dead so that she can rule permanently, leaving her nephew to rot in his cell. The Smurfs and Clockwork Smurf help Gerard to escape and expose her and she is banished from the kingdom, never to return. Although other equally evil relatives of Gerard, namely his uncle Sir Leopold in \"Return of the Clockwork Smurf\" and his cousin Malcolm the Mean in \"The Noble Stag\", have tried to take the boy king's throne instead.\n|-\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''The Wartmongers'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Will Ryan]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | The Wartmongers are little [[toad]]-like creatures who live in the muck and slime of Creepy Deepy Swamp and often cause the Smurfs problems. They consider having more warts than others as a source of pride. They like ripping the wings off of the Pussiwillow Pixies, and, like the Pixies, at first think that Smurfs are hairy, red-eyed monsters. The leader of the Wartmongers is '''King Bullrush''' (voiced by [[Kenneth Mars]]) who commands his minions to do his bidding.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Evelyn'''''\n|\n| Cartoon\n| [[Ruta Lee]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Evelyn is a glamorous but evil [[Magician (paranormal)|enchantress]] who only appears in the Smurfs television cartoon show episode \"Gargamel's Sweetheart\". She rides around in a carriage with her pet black [[weasel]] Satin, which she keeps draped around her shoulders like a fur stole, and she extorts people with her magic wand to surrender all their money or valuables. Gargamel falls in love with her and tries unsuccessfully to catch her interest by pretending to be a powerful, rich sorcerer. She does feign a mutual attraction to him when he claims he knows how to make gold, and agrees to help him catch Smurfs to do so. The Smurfs outsmart them though, and she ends up dropping both her pretense and Gargamel like a hot potato.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''\"Mummy\" (a.k.a.

She occasionally makes unannounced visits to her son, usually to berate him over his inability to catch the Smurfs. Also when she visits, she insists on doing the cooking at which she is terrible as both her son and Azrael can attest. She also hates cats and always throws Azrael out of Gargamel's hovel when she arrives to visit. On one occasion, she and Madame Lavinia tried to get Gargamel to be a suitor to a baron's daughter named Andiria. Due to the interference of the Smurfs as Gargamel keeps claiming, the baron called the wedding off. This caused Gargamel to be dealt with by his mother when they get home. When Madame Lavinia states that she still would like to be paid her commission for this involvement, Gargame's mother states that her son \"will pay.\"\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Corbelius'''''\n|\n| Comics\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Corbelius is a black crow who is Gargamel's other pet in the comics, appearing far less frequently than Azrael. He serves Gargamel primarily in delivering letters, usually threats or ransom demands to the Smurfs. Unlike Azrael, Corbelius does not seem to take any malicious pleasure in what he does; if anything, he seems indifferent.\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''Monty'''''\n|\n| Movie ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]''\n|| [[Dee Bradley Baker]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Monty is a vulture-like bird who is Gargamel's other pet in the ''Lost Village'' movie. Monty seems to be Gargamel's favorite, even though he seems like a lesser intellect, which irritates Azrael to no end. Monty does have a mean streak and can get quite angry, but seems more content with being dopey. Monty bears an uncanny resemblance to the titular creature from the episode The Howlibird.\n|}\n\n==Supporting characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Original French name\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Appears in\n! style=\"background-color: #C5E4E1\" | Voiced by\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''[[Johan and Peewit]]'''''\n| Johan et Pirlouit\n| Comics + Cartoon\n| Sir Johan: [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')<br>Pewitt: [[Frank Welker]] and [[Cam Clarke]] (in ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'')\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" | Johan is a young human [[squire]] and [[Page (servant)|page boy]] of an unnamed king near the Smurf village.

It was in a ''Johan and Peewit'' adventure published in 1958 that the Smurfs were first introduced. The Smurfs would appear in some of the later adventures of Johan and Peewit, as well as their own series. In the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series during the second season, Johan and Peewit were occasionally featured in stories which focused on the pair and the kingdom they protected. Johan rides a white horse named Bayard, and Peewit rides a goat named Biquette (Nanny in ''The Smurfs and the Magic Flute''). In the cartoon, Peewit sings in an off-key voice and is always hungry.

He also frequently breaks into Gargamel's hovel and eats his food and also eats rocks (which he likes dipped in slime). He is friends with whoever may be offering him something in exchange.

The location of the Manor Ground was unsuitable for conversion into an all-seater stadium, so the club decided to move to a purpose-built all-seater stadium (later to be named the [[Kassam Stadium]]) on the outskirts of the city, on land near the [[Blackbird Leys]] housing estate. Construction work began in the early part of 1997, but was suspended later that year due to the club's financial problems.
