She married Marco Arese Lucini, sixth count of Barlassina of the [[House of Arese|Arese family]], son of Benedetto Arese Lucini and Margherita Lucini of the Marquis of Besate, on the 20th of February 1798 in the church of [[Santa Maria alla Porta, Milan|Santa Maria alla Porta]].

The poet dedicated his ode ''All'amica risanata'' ('To the healed friend') to her, stating \"Oh how beautiful you were that evening! How many times I retracted my eyes full of fear! Yes, my fantasy and my heart began to create of you a divinity,\" (\"''E com'eri tu bella questa sera! Quante volte ho ritirati i miei occhi pieni di spavento!

His ''[[The American Crisis]]'' (1776\u20131783) was a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series.

He wrote ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791), in part a defense of the French Revolution against its critics. His attacks on Anglo-Irish [[Conservatism|conservative]] writer [[Edmund Burke]] led to [[Trial of Thomas Paine|a trial and conviction]] [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] in England in 1792 for the crime of [[seditious libel]].\n\nThe British government of [[William Pitt the Younger]], worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a [[writ]] for his arrest issued in early 1792. Paine fled to France in September where, despite not being able to speak French, he was quickly elected to the French [[National Convention]]. The [[Girondist]]s regarded him as an ally. Consequently, the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]], especially [[Maximilien Robespierre]], regarded him as an enemy.\n\nIn December 1793, he was arrested and was taken to Luxembourg Prison in Paris. While in prison, he continued to work on ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1793\u20131794). [[James Monroe]], a future President of the [[United States]], used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794. Paine became notorious because of his pamphlets. ''The Age of Reason'', in which he advocated [[deism]], promoted reason and free thought and argued against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. He published the pamphlet ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'' (1797), discussing the origins of [[property]] and introduced the concept of a [[guaranteed minimum income]] through a one-time [[inheritance tax]] on landowners. In 1802, he returned to the U.S. When he died on June 8, 1809 only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity.<ref name=\"Conway2\">[[Moncure D.

It was passed around and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the idea of republicanism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the [[Continental Army]]. Paine provided a new and convincing argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice.

Whereas colonial resentments were originally directed primarily against the king's ministers and Parliament, Paine laid the responsibility firmly at the king's door. ''Common Sense'' was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution. It was a clarion call for unity against the corrupt British court, so as to realize America's providential role in providing an asylum for liberty. Written in a direct and lively style, it denounced the decaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an absurdity. At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with Britain, ''Common Sense'' demonstrated to many the inevitability of separation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas Paine|author=Philp, Mark|author-link=Mark Philp|editor=Edward N.

To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with ''Common Sense'' serving as a primary example. Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries.<ref>Merrill Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763\u20131776'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 668.</ref> Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the historic moment, Paine's easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.<ref>David C.

He synthesized various philosophical and political uses of the term in a way that permanently impacted American political thought. He used two ideas from [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]: that ordinary people can indeed make sound judgments on major political issues, and that there exists a body of popular wisdom that is readily apparent to anyone. Paine also used a notion of \"common sense\" favored by [[philosophe]]s in the Continental Enlightenment. They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions. Thus, Paine used \"common sense\" as a weapon to delegitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom. Rosenfeld concludes that the phenomenal appeal of his pamphlet resulted from his synthesis of popular and elite elements in the independence movement.<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Sophia Rosenfeld|jstor=40212021|title=Tom Paine's Common Sense and Ours|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=65|issue=4|pages=633\u2013668|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian [[Robert Middlekauff]], ''Common Sense'' became immensely popular mainly because Paine appealed to widespread convictions. Monarchy, he said, was preposterous and it had a heathenish origin. It was an institution of the devil. Paine pointed to the [[Old Testament]], where almost all kings had seduced the Israelites to worship idols instead of God. Paine also denounced aristocracy, which together with monarchy were \"two ancient tyrannies.\" They violated the laws of nature, human reason, and the \"universal order of things,\" which began with God. That was, Middlekauff says, exactly what most Americans wanted to hear. He calls the Revolutionary generation \"the children of the twice-born\".<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, NY; {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 30\u201353.</ref> because in their childhood they had experienced the [[Great Awakening]], which, for the first time, had tied Americans together, transcending denominational and ethnic boundaries and giving them a sense of patriotism.<ref>Robert Middlekauff, ''The Glorious Cause'', pp. 4\u20135, 324\u201326.</ref><ref>Cf.

The following year, he alluded to secret negotiation underway with France in his pamphlets. His enemies denounced his indiscretions.

During the Revolutionary War, Paine served as an aide-de-camp to the important general, [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crisis in representation: Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Helen Maria Williams, and the rewriting of the French Revolution|last=Blakemore|first=Steve|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n====Silas Deane affair====\nIn what may have been an error, and perhaps even contributed to his resignation as the secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was openly critical of [[Silas Deane]], an American diplomat who had been appointed in March 1776 by the Congress to travel to France in secret. Deane's goal was to influence the French government to finance the colonists in their fight for independence. Paine largely saw Deane as a war profiteer who had little respect for principle, having been under the employ of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], one of the primary financiers of the American Revolution and working with [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a French royal agent sent to the colonies by King Louis to investigate the Anglo-American conflict. Paine uncovered the financial connection between Morris, who was Superintendent for Finance of the Continental Congress, and Deane.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 89</ref> Paine labeled Deane as unpatriotic, and demanded that there be a public investigation into Morris' financing of the Revolution, as he had contracted with his own company for around $500,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nWealthy men, such as Robert Morris, [[John Jay]] and powerful [[merchant bank]]ers, were leaders of the Continental Congress and defended holding public positions while at the same time profiting off their own personal financial dealings with governments.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 89</ref> Amongst Paine's criticisms, he had written in the ''[[Pennsylvania Packet]]'' that France had \"'' prefaced [their] alliance by an early and generous friendship'',\" referring to aid that had been provided to American colonies prior to the recognition of the Franco-American treaties. This was alleged to be effectively an embarrassment to France, which potentially could have jeopardized the alliance. John Jay, the President of the Congress, who had been a fervent supporter of Deane, immediately spoke out against Paine's comments. The controversy eventually became public, and Paine was then denounced as unpatriotic for criticizing an American revolutionary. He was even physically assaulted twice in the street by Deane supporters.  This much-added stress took a large toll on Paine, who was generally of a sensitive character and he resigned as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs in 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/134 134\u201338]|isbn=978-0-670-03788-9|year=2006|url=https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/134|publisher=New York : Viking}}</ref> Paine left the Committee without even having enough money to buy food for himself.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 93</ref>\n\nMuch later, when Paine returned from his mission to France, Deane's corruption had become more widely acknowledged. Many, including Robert Morris, apologized to Paine and Paine's reputation in Philadelphia was restored.\n<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 102-103</ref>\n\n===Public Good===\n\nIn 1780, Paine published a pamphlet entitled \"Public Good,\" in which he made the case that territories west of the 13 colonies that had been part of the British Empire belonged after the Declaration of Independence to the American government, and did not belong to any of the 13 states or to any individual [[land speculation | speculators]]. A [[royal charter]] of 1609 had granted to the [[Virginia Company]] land stretching to the Pacific Ocean. A small group of wealthy Virginia land speculators, including the Washington, Lee, and Randolph families, had taken advantage of this royal charter to survey and to claim title to huge swaths of land, including much land west of the 13 colonies. In \"Public Good,\" Paine argued that these lands belonged to the American government as represented by the Continental Congress. This angered many of Paine's wealthy Virginia friends, including [[Richard Henry Lee]] of the powerful Lee family, who had been Paine's closest ally in Congress, [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], all of whom had claimed to huge wild tracts that Paine was advocating should be government owned. The view that Paine had advocated eventually prevailed when the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 was passed.\n\nThe animosity Paine felt as a result of the publication of \"Public Good\" fueled his decision to embark with [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Laurens]] on a mission to travel to Paris to obtain funding for the American war effort.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 100-101</ref>\n\n===Funding the Revolution===\nPaine accompanied Col.

The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col. Laurens, \"positively objected\" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting \"a bad precedent and an improper mode\". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the [[Bank of North America]] to raise money to supply the army.<ref>Daniel Wheeler, ''Life and Writings of Thomas Paine'' Vol. 1 (1908), pg. 314.</ref> In 1785, he was given $3,000 by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in recognition of his service to the nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Common Sense and Other Writings|author=Paine, Thomas|year=2005|publisher=Barnes & Noble Classics|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonsenseother0000pain/page/ xiii]|isbn=978-0-672-60004-3|url=https://archive.org/details/commonsenseother0000pain/page/}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Laurens]] (father of Col. [[John Laurens]]) had been the ambassador to the [[Netherlands]], but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner [[Lord Cornwallis]] in late 1781, Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Thomas Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate Thomas Willing who became the first president of the Bank of North America in January 1782. They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to \"organize\" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris.<ref name=\"Paine1824\"/>\n\n[[File:Fashion-before-Ease-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Fashion before Ease; \u2014or,\u2014 A good Constitution sacrificed for a Fantastick Form'' (1793), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Paine tightening the [[corset]] of [[Britannia]] and protruding from his coat pocket is a measuring tape inscribed \"Rights of Man\"]]\nPaine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown City]], New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809.

He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called ''Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament''. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Man Of Reason: The Life Of Thomas Paine|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred|publisher=J.

Meanwhile, conservative intellectual [[Edmund Burke]] launched a counterrevolutionary blast against the French Revolution, entitled ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which strongly appealed to the landed class, and sold 30,000 copies. Paine set out to refute it in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791). He wrote it not as a quick pamphlet, but as a long, abstract political tract of 90,000 words which tore apart monarchies and traditional social institutions. On January 31, 1791, he gave the manuscript to publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]]. A visit by government agents dissuaded Johnson, so Paine gave the book to publisher J.&nbsp;S. Jordan, then went to Paris, per [[William Blake]]'s advice. He charged three good friends, [[William Godwin]], [[Thomas Brand Hollis]], and [[Thomas Holcroft]], with handling publication details. The book appeared on March 13, 1791 and sold nearly a million copies.

However, Paine's speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who claimed that as a Quaker, Paine's religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment and thus he should be ineligible to vote.

A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was due to the fact that the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors.

Having received no response, Paine contacted his lifelong publisher [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Bache]], the [[Jeffersonian Democrat]], to publish his ''Letter to George Washington'' of 1796 in which he derided Washington's reputation by describing him as a treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero.

Paine returned to the United States in the early stages of the [[Second Great Awakening]] and a time of great political partisanship. The ''Age of Reason'' gave ample excuse for the religiously devout to dislike him and the Federalists attacked him for his ideas of government stated in ''Common Sense,'' for his association with the French Revolution and for his friendship with President Jefferson. Also still fresh in the minds of the public was his ''Letter to Washington'' published six years before his return. This was compounded when his right to vote was denied in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] on the grounds that Gouverneur Morris did not recognize him as an American and Washington had not aided him.<ref>Claeys, Gregory, 1989.

In his will, Paine left the bulk of his estate to Marguerite, including 100 acres (40.5 ha) of his farm so she could maintain and educate Benjamin and his brother Thomas.

Paine's birth date, therefore, would have been before New Year, 1737. In the new style, his birth date advances by eleven days and his year increases by one to February 9, 1737.

His ''[[The American Crisis]]'' (1776\u20131783) was a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series.

He wrote ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791), in part a defense of the French Revolution against its critics. His attacks on Anglo-Irish [[Conservatism|conservative]] writer [[Edmund Burke]] led to [[Trial of Thomas Paine|a trial and conviction]] [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] in England in 1792 for the crime of [[seditious libel]].\n\nThe British government of [[William Pitt the Younger]], worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a [[writ]] for his arrest issued in early 1792. Paine fled to France in September where, despite not being able to speak French, he was quickly elected to the French [[National Convention]]. The [[Girondist]]s regarded him as an ally. Consequently, the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]], especially [[Maximilien Robespierre]], regarded him as an enemy.\n\nIn December 1793, he was arrested and was taken to Luxembourg Prison in Paris. While in prison, he continued to work on ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1793\u20131794). [[James Monroe]], a future President of the [[United States]], used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794. Paine became notorious because of his pamphlets. ''The Age of Reason'', in which he advocated [[deism]], promoted reason and free thought and argued against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. He published the pamphlet ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'' (1797), discussing the origins of [[property]] and introduced the concept of a [[guaranteed minimum income]] through a one-time [[inheritance tax]] on landowners. In 1802, he returned to the U.S. When he died on June 8, 1809 only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity.<ref name=\"Conway2\">[[Moncure D.

It was passed around and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the idea of republicanism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the [[Continental Army]]. Paine provided a new and convincing argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offers a solution for Americans disgusted with and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Commonalities of Common Sense|author=Robert A.

Whereas colonial resentments were originally directed primarily against the king's ministers and Parliament, Paine laid the responsibility firmly at the king's door. ''Common Sense'' was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution. It was a clarion call for unity against the corrupt British court, so as to realize America's providential role in providing an asylum for liberty. Written in a direct and lively style, it denounced the decaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an absurdity. At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with Britain, ''Common Sense'' demonstrated to many the inevitability of separation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Thomas Paine|author=Philp, Mark|author-link=Mark Philp|editor=Edward N.

To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with ''Common Sense'' serving as a primary example. Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries.<ref>Merrill Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763\u20131776'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 668.</ref> Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the historic moment, Paine's easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.<ref>David C.

He synthesized various philosophical and political uses of the term in a way that permanently impacted American political thought. He used two ideas from [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]: that ordinary people can indeed make sound judgments on major political issues, and that there exists a body of popular wisdom that is readily apparent to anyone. Paine also used a notion of \"common sense\" favored by [[philosophe]]s in the Continental Enlightenment. They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions. Thus, Paine used \"common sense\" as a weapon to delegitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom. Rosenfeld concludes that the phenomenal appeal of his pamphlet resulted from his synthesis of popular and elite elements in the independence movement.<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Sophia Rosenfeld|jstor=40212021|title=Tom Paine's Common Sense and Ours|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=65|issue=4|pages=633\u2013668|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historian [[Robert Middlekauff]], ''Common Sense'' became immensely popular mainly because Paine appealed to widespread convictions. Monarchy, he said, was preposterous and it had a heathenish origin. It was an institution of the devil. Paine pointed to the [[Old Testament]], where almost all kings had seduced the Israelites to worship idols instead of God. Paine also denounced aristocracy, which together with monarchy were \"two ancient tyrannies.\" They violated the laws of nature, human reason, and the \"universal order of things,\" which began with God. That was, Middlekauff says, exactly what most Americans wanted to hear. He calls the Revolutionary generation \"the children of the twice-born\".<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, NY; {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 30\u201353.</ref> because in their childhood they had experienced the [[Great Awakening]], which, for the first time, had tied Americans together, transcending denominational and ethnic boundaries and giving them a sense of patriotism.<ref>Robert Middlekauff, ''The Glorious Cause'', pp. 4\u20135, 324\u201326.</ref><ref>Cf.

The following year, he alluded to secret negotiation underway with France in his pamphlets. His enemies denounced his indiscretions. There was scandal; together with Paine's conflict with [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Silas Deane]] it led to Paine's expulsion from the Committee in 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine: Enlightenment, Revolution, and the Birth of Modern Nations|last=Nelson|first=Craig|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|pages=174\u201375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRFql6S6jKgC&pg=PT174|isbn=9781101201787}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1781, he accompanied [[John Laurens]] on his mission to France.

During the Revolutionary War, Paine served as an aide-de-camp to the important general, [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crisis in representation: Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Helen Maria Williams, and the rewriting of the French Revolution|last=Blakemore|first=Steve|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n====Silas Deane affair====\nIn what may have been an error, and perhaps even contributed to his resignation as the secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was openly critical of [[Silas Deane]], an American diplomat who had been appointed in March 1776 by the Congress to travel to France in secret. Deane's goal was to influence the French government to finance the colonists in their fight for independence. Paine largely saw Deane as a war profiteer who had little respect for principle, having been under the employ of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], one of the primary financiers of the American Revolution and working with [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a French royal agent sent to the colonies by King Louis to investigate the Anglo-American conflict. Paine uncovered the financial connection between Morris, who was Superintendent for Finance of the Continental Congress, and Deane.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 89</ref> Paine labeled Deane as unpatriotic, and demanded that there be a public investigation into Morris' financing of the Revolution, as he had contracted with his own company for around $500,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nWealthy men, such as Robert Morris, [[John Jay]] and powerful [[merchant bank]]ers, were leaders of the Continental Congress and defended holding public positions while at the same time profiting off their own personal financial dealings with governments.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 89</ref> Amongst Paine's criticisms, he had written in the ''[[Pennsylvania Packet]]'' that France had \"'' prefaced [their] alliance by an early and generous friendship'',\" referring to aid that had been provided to American colonies prior to the recognition of the Franco-American treaties. This was alleged to be effectively an embarrassment to France, which potentially could have jeopardized the alliance. John Jay, the President of the Congress, who had been a fervent supporter of Deane, immediately spoke out against Paine's comments. The controversy eventually became public, and Paine was then denounced as unpatriotic for criticizing an American revolutionary. He was even physically assaulted twice in the street by Deane supporters.  This much-added stress took a large toll on Paine, who was generally of a sensitive character and he resigned as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs in 1779.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/134 134\u201338]|isbn=978-0-670-03788-9|year=2006|url=https://archive.org/details/thomaspaineenlig0000nels/page/134|publisher=New York : Viking}}</ref> Paine left the Committee without even having enough money to buy food for himself.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 93</ref>\n\nMuch later, when Paine returned from his mission to France, Deane's corruption had become more widely acknowledged.

A [[royal charter]] of 1609 had granted to the [[Virginia Company]] land stretching to the Pacific Ocean. A small group of wealthy Virginia land speculators, including the Washington, Lee, and Randolph families, had taken advantage of this royal charter to survey and to claim title to huge swaths of land, including much land west of the 13 colonies. In \"Public Good,\" Paine argued that these lands belonged to the American government as represented by the Continental Congress. This angered many of Paine's wealthy Virginia friends, including [[Richard Henry Lee]] of the powerful Lee family, who had been Paine's closest ally in Congress, [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], all of whom had claimed to huge wild tracts that Paine was advocating should be government owned. The view that Paine had advocated eventually prevailed when the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 was passed.\n\nThe animosity Paine felt as a result of the publication of \"Public Good\" fueled his decision to embark with [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Laurens]] on a mission to travel to Paris to obtain funding for the American war effort.<ref>Harlow Giles Unger, \"Thomas Paine and the Clarion Call for American Independence,\" (New York: Da Capo Press, 2019), p. 100-101</ref>\n\n===Funding the Revolution===\nPaine accompanied Col.

The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col. Laurens, \"positively objected\" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting \"a bad precedent and an improper mode\". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the [[Bank of North America]] to raise money to supply the army.<ref>Daniel Wheeler, ''Life and Writings of Thomas Paine'' Vol. 1 (1908), pg. 314.</ref> In 1785, he was given $3,000 by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in recognition of his service to the nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Common Sense and Other Writings|author=Paine, Thomas|year=2005|publisher=Barnes & Noble Classics|page=[https://archive.org/details/commonsenseother0000pain/page/ xiii]|isbn=978-0-672-60004-3|url=https://archive.org/details/commonsenseother0000pain/page/}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Laurens]] (father of Col. [[John Laurens]]) had been the ambassador to the [[Netherlands]], but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner [[Lord Cornwallis]] in late 1781, Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Thomas Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate Thomas Willing who became the first president of the Bank of North America in January 1782. They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to \"organize\" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris.<ref name=\"Paine1824\"/>\n\n[[File:Fashion-before-Ease-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Fashion before Ease; \u2014or,\u2014 A good Constitution sacrificed for a Fantastick Form'' (1793), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Paine tightening the [[corset]] of [[Britannia]] and protruding from his coat pocket is a measuring tape inscribed \"Rights of Man\"]]\nPaine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown City]], New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809.

Meanwhile, conservative intellectual [[Edmund Burke]] launched a counterrevolutionary blast against the French Revolution, entitled ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which strongly appealed to the landed class, and sold 30,000 copies. Paine set out to refute it in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791). He wrote it not as a quick pamphlet, but as a long, abstract political tract of 90,000 words which tore apart monarchies and traditional social institutions. On January 31, 1791, he gave the manuscript to publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]]. A visit by government agents dissuaded Johnson, so Paine gave the book to publisher J.&nbsp;S. Jordan, then went to Paris, per [[William Blake]]'s advice. He charged three good friends, [[William Godwin]], [[Thomas Brand Hollis]], and [[Thomas Holcroft]], with handling publication details. The book appeared on March 13, 1791 and sold nearly a million copies. It was \"eagerly read by reformers, Protestant dissenters, democrats, London craftsmen, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north\".<ref>George Rud\u00e9, ''Revolutionary Europe: 1783\u20131815'' (1964), pg. 183.<!--publisher; ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n[[File:Thomas Paine's Nightly Pest.jpg|thumb|left|English satirist [[James Gillray]] ridicules Paine in Paris awaiting sentence of execution from three hanging judges.]]\n\nUndeterred by the government campaign to discredit him, Paine issued his ''Rights of Man, Part the Second, Combining Principle and Practice'' in February 1792. It detailed a representative government with enumerated social programs to remedy the numbing poverty of commoners through [[progressive tax]] measures. Radically reduced in price to ensure unprecedented circulation, it was sensational in its impact and gave birth to reform societies. An indictment for [[seditious libel]] followed, for both publisher and author, while government agents followed Paine and instigated mobs, hate meetings, and burnings in effigy.

However, Paine's speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who claimed that as a Quaker, Paine's religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment and thus he should be ineligible to vote.

However, [[Gouverneur Morris]], the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was due to the fact that the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning.

A physician turned international [[espionage|spy]], he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery and was accidentally doused with a chemical that turned his hair and skin purple. Though he was caught and questioned, offering a weak alibi, he was released. Several more incidents like this demonstrated that the nerve gas had given Killgrave the ability to command the wills of other people. Calling himself the Purple Man, Killgrave embarked on a criminal career. \n\nEarly in his criminal career, he used his mind-control powers to force a woman to become his wife. Before she recovered and left him, she became pregnant with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #41. Marvel Comics</ref>  Kara inherited his discoloration and powers and became the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the Purple Girl,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]] in ''Alpha Flight'' issue #41.\n\nThe character largely disappeared from comic books during the 1980s although he did face Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Power Man and Iron Fist in ''Marvel Team-Up'' Annual #4. He also appeared in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel|graphic novel]] ''Emperor Doom'' in which [[Doctor Doom]] uses Killgrave to power a machine called the \"psycho-prism\" that allowed Doom to control the minds of everyone on Earth. During the process, Purple Man finds out that he cannot control Doctor Doom's mind even at close range, as Doom's mental fortitude is too great.\n\nHe later reappeared in the pages of ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'', as the mastermind behind Nate Grey's rise to super-celebrity status as a miracle worker in New York City.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He had been subtly manipulating both the population of Manhattan and Nate himself into accepting and embracing the young exile from the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline as a modern [[messiah|messianic figure]], who would then become so psychologically empowered by hero worship that he could and would literally change the reality of the world, using the full potential of his mutant power. The plan ultimately failed when Nate learns the truth and loses his confidence, thus reducing his power.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Killgrave goes once more into hiding.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nAs detailed in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', the Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]].<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Alias|issue=#24-28|date=2004}}</ref> When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind-control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while psychologically torturing her for several months. He ultimately sends her off to kill Daredevil. The incident with Purple Man leaves her so traumatized that she leaves her life as a superhero behind and becomes a private investigator.<ref>''Alias'' #26-28</ref> Later, the Purple Man escapes again and tries controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she is able to resist and knocks him out. Daredevil later has the Purple Man imprisoned in the Raft, a jail designed for super-powered criminals.<ref>''Alias'' #28</ref>\n\nHe escapes briefly, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] creates a riot at the Raft. Purple Man then attempts to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatens Jones, who is pregnant with Cage's child. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he is unable to control Cage, who subsequently beats him to a pulp in response to his demands.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01-03 (Jan-Mar 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nLater, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the \"[[House of M]]\" storyline and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to free Kilgrave from prison, leaving an illusion in his place so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. With his pheromones distributed through the New York City water system and Zemo's moonstones used to project his voice wherever necessary the Purple Man enslaved the entire city. Under Zemo's direction he used the city's superhumans as his personal army to attack the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]], after which Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10-12|date=2005}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Scared Straight'' crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3.

A physician turned international [[espionage|spy]], he was sent to infiltrate a chemical refinery and was accidentally doused with a chemical that turned his hair and skin purple. Though he was caught and questioned, offering a weak alibi, he was released. Several more incidents like this demonstrated that the nerve gas had given Killgrave the ability to command the wills of other people. Calling himself the Purple Man, Killgrave embarked on a criminal career. \n\nEarly in his criminal career, he used his mind-control powers to force a woman to become his wife. Before she recovered and left him, she became pregnant with his daughter, Kara Killgrave.<ref>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #41. Marvel Comics</ref>  Kara inherited his discoloration and powers and became the [[Alpha Flight]]-affiliated superhero called the Purple Girl,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later [[Persuasion (comics)|Persuasion]] in ''Alpha Flight'' issue #41.\n\nThe character largely disappeared from comic books during the 1980s although he did face Spider-Man, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Power Man and Iron Fist in ''Marvel Team-Up'' Annual #4. He also appeared in the [[Marvel Graphic Novel|graphic novel]] ''Emperor Doom'' in which [[Doctor Doom]] uses Killgrave to power a machine called the \"psycho-prism\" that allowed Doom to control the minds of everyone on Earth. During the process, Purple Man finds out that he cannot control Doctor Doom's mind even at close range, as Doom's mental fortitude is too great.\n\nHe later reappeared in the pages of ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'', as the mastermind behind Nate Grey's rise to super-celebrity status as a miracle worker in New York City.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He had been subtly manipulating both the population of Manhattan and Nate himself into accepting and embracing the young exile from the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline as a modern [[messiah|messianic figure]], who would then become so psychologically empowered by hero worship that he could and would literally change the reality of the world, using the full potential of his mutant power. The plan ultimately failed when Nate learns the truth and loses his confidence, thus reducing his power.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Killgrave goes once more into hiding.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nAs detailed in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', the Purple Man has since been revealed to be linked to the history of [[Jessica Jones]].<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Alias|issue=#24-28|date=2004}}</ref> When she was the superhero Jewel, he used his mind-control powers to subdue her, forcing her to live with him while psychologically torturing her for several months. He ultimately sends her off to kill Daredevil. The incident with Purple Man leaves her so traumatized that she leaves her life as a superhero behind and becomes a private investigator.<ref>''Alias'' #26-28</ref> Later, the Purple Man escapes again and tries controlling Jessica to kill the Avengers, but she is able to resist and knocks him out. Daredevil later has the Purple Man imprisoned in the Raft, a jail designed for super-powered criminals.<ref>''Alias'' #28</ref>\n\nHe escapes briefly, when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] creates a riot at the Raft. Purple Man then attempts to use the opportunity to mind control [[Luke Cage]] into killing the then soon-to-be-Avengers, and threatens Jones, who is pregnant with Cage's child. Unknown to the Purple Man, drugs had been put into his food to negate his powers during his imprisonment, so he is unable to control Cage, who subsequently beats him to a pulp in response to his demands.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #01-03 (Jan-Mar 2005). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nLater, the Purple Man returned shortly before (and during) the \"[[House of M]]\" storyline and manipulated the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], while being manipulated himself by [[Baron Zemo]], who used the moonstones he had recently acquired to free Kilgrave from prison, leaving an illusion in his place so that the authorities would not be aware of his escape. With his pheromones distributed through the New York City water system and Zemo's moonstones used to project his voice wherever necessary the Purple Man enslaved the entire city. Under Zemo's direction he used the city's superhumans as his personal army to attack the Thunderbolts, whom he had worked to turn against each other. Eventually, he was defeated by the Thunderbolts member [[Genis-Vell]], after which Zemo [[Teleportation|teleport]]ed the Purple Man back and [[torture]]d him for his failure before sending him back to prison once more.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10-12|date=2005}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Scared Straight'' crossover between ''Thunderbolts'' and ''Avengers Academy'', the Purple Man is revealed to be incarcerated in the Raft Maximum Security Penitentiary, as [[Tigra]] warns her Academy students not to look at his face or read his lips.<ref>''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #3.

The term comes from the French word ''sans'', meaning \"without\" and \"serif\" of uncertain origin, possibly from the Dutch word ''schreef'' meaning \"line\" or pen-stroke. In printed media, they are more commonly used for [[Display typeface|display use]] and less for [[body text]].\n\nBefore the term \"sans-serif\" became common in English typography, a number of other terms had been used. One of these outmoded terms for sans serif was [[East Asian gothic typeface|gothic]], which is still used in East Asian typography and sometimes seen in font names like [[News Gothic]], [[Highway Gothic]], or [[Trade Gothic]].\n\nSans-serif fonts are sometimes, especially in older documents, used as a device for [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], due to their typically blacker [[type color]].\n\n=={{anchor|Classification}} Classification==<!-- This section is linked from [[Serif]] -->\n\n{{Details|Vox-ATypI classification#Lineal}} \nFor the purposes of type classification, sans-serif designs are usually divided into three or four major groups, the fourth being the result of splitting the ''grotesque'' category into grotesque and neo-grotesque.<ref name=PJIM /><ref name=BS_2961 />\n\n===Grotesque===\n[[File:Akzidenz Grotesk Regular & Italic.svg|thumb|Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk, pangram specimen|[[Akzidenz Grotesk]], originally released by [[Berthold Type Foundry|H.

The early sans-serif typefaces often did not feature a lower case or [[Italic type|italics]], since they were not needed for such uses.

A typical neo-grotesque.]]\nAs the name implies, these modern designs consist of a direct evolution of grotesque types. They are relatively straightforward in appearance with limited width variation. Unlike earlier grotesque designs, many were issued in extremely large and versatile families from the time of release, making them easier to use for body text. Similar to grotesque typefaces, neo grotesques often feature capitals of uniform width and a quite 'folded-up' design, in which strokes (for example on the 'c') are curved all the way round to end on a perfect horizontal or vertical. [[Helvetica]] is an example of this. Others such as [[Univers]] are less regular.\n\nNeo-grotesque type began in the 1950s with the emergence of the [[International Typographic Style]], or Swiss style. Its members looked at the clear lines of [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] (1898) as an inspiration to create rational, almost neutral typefaces. In 1957 the release of [[Helvetica]], [[Univers]], and [[Folio (typeface)|Folio]], the first typefaces categorized as neo-grotesque, had a strong impact internationally: Helvetica came to be the most used typeface for the following decades.{{sfn|Meggs|2011|pp=376-377}}{{efn|Digital publishing expert Florian Hardwig describes the main features of neo-grotesques as being \"consistent details and even text colour.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |user=hardwig |number=1140368448482172928 |date=16 June 2019 |title=The mid-20th century saw a reappraisal of these classic sans serif forms.

However, [[Roman square capitals]], the inspiration for much Latin-alphabet lettering throughout history, had prominent serifs. While simple sans-serif letters have always been common in \"uncultured\" writing and sometimes even in epigraphy, such as basic handwriting, most artistically created letters in the Latin alphabet, both sculpted and printed, since the Middle Ages have been inspired by fine calligraphy, [[blackletter]] writing and [[Roman square capitals]].

Perhaps the first use of the term was due to the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry, which in 1837 published a set of non-serifed typefaces under that name. It is believed that those were the first sans serif designs to be introduced in America.{{sfn|Lawson|1990|p=295}} The term probably derived from the architectural definition, which is neither Greek nor Roman,<ref>[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/gothic/oed.html OED Definition of Gothic]</ref> and from the extended adjective term of \"Germany\", which was the place where sans-serif typefaces became popular in the 19th to 20th centuries.<ref>[http://www.linotype.com/en/795/thesansseriftypefaces.html The Sans Serif Typefaces]</ref> Early adopters for the term includes Miller & Richard (1863), J.&nbsp;&&nbsp;R.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Wood (1865), Lothian, Conner, Bruce McKellar. Although the usage is now rare in the English-speaking world, the term is commonly used in Japan and South Korea; in China they are known by the term '''[[East Asian gothic typeface|heiti]]''' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u9ad4}}), literally meaning \"black type\", which is probably derived from the mistranslation of Gothic as blackletter typeface, even though actual blackletter fonts have serifs.\n\n===Recents===\n*'''Lineale''', or '''linear''': The term was defined by [[Maximilien Vox]] in the [[VOX-ATypI classification]] to describe sans-serif types.

There is some contrast in thickness of strokes. They have squareness of curve, and curling close-set jaws. The R usually has a curled leg and the G is spurred. The ends of the curved strokes are usually oblique. Examples include the [[Grotesque (Stephenson Blake typefaces)|Stephenson Blake Grotesques]], Condensed Sans No. 7, Monotype Headline Bold.\n<br/>\n'''Neo-grotesque''': Lineale typefaces derived from the grotesque. They have less stroke contrast and are more regular in design. The jaws are more open than in the true grotesque and the g is often open-tailed. The ends of the curved strokes are usually horizontal. Examples include Edel/Wotan, [[Univers]], [[Helvetica]].\n<br/>\n'''Humanist''': Lineale typefaces based on the proportions of inscriptional Roman capitals and Humanist or Garalde lower-case, rather than on early grotesques. They have some stroke contrast, with two-storey a and g. Examples include [[Optima]], [[Gill Sans]], Pascal.\n<br/>\n'''Geometric''': Lineale typefaces constructed on simple geometric shapes, circle or rectangle. Usually monoline, and often with single-storey a. Examples include [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]], [[Erbar]], [[Eurostile]].\n</ref>\n<ref name=PJIM>{{cite journal |last= Childers|first= |last2= Griscti|first2= |last3= Leben|first3= |date= January 2013 |title= 25 Systems for Classifying Typography: A Study in Naming Frequency\n|url= http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/issues/2013/01/pdfs/ParsonsJournalForInformationMapping_Childers_Griscti_Leben.pdf\n|journal= The Parsons Journal for Information Mapping|publisher= The Parsons Institute for Information Mapping |volume= V |issue= 1|pages= |doi= |accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=behrens>{{citation\n | title=Feste des Lebens und der Kunst: eine Betrachtung des Theaters als h\u00f6chsten Kultursymbols\n | last1 = Behrens | first1= Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Behrens\n | url=https://archive.org/details/festedeslebensun00behr\n | year=1900\n | language=German\n | publisher=Eugen Diederichs\n}}</ref><ref name=nymphgrot>James Mosley, ''The Nymph and the Grot: the revival of the sanserif letter'', London: Friends of the St Bride Printing Library, 1999</ref><ref name=nymphgrot_update>{{Citation\n| url   = http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html\n| title = The Nymph and the Grot, an update\n| last1 = Mosley | first1= James\n| date   = January 6, 2007\n| accessdate = June 10, 2014\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140610132607/http://typefoundry.blogspot.it/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html\n|archivedate= June 10, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n<!-- unused reference\n<ref name=lupton>{{citation|first1=Ellen |last1= Lupton|title=Thinking with Type|url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=oz1FAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2010|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|isbn=978-1-61689-045-2|edition=2nd|page=46}}</ref>\n-->\n\n}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n| title= The Elements of Typographic Style\n| authorlink1= Robert Bringhurst \n| last1 = Bringhurst \n| first1= Robert \n| isbn=9780881792065\n| url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=940sAAAAYAAJ\n| year=2004\n| publisher=[[Hartley & Marks Publishers]]\n| edition  = 3rd}}\n\n* {{citation|last=Haralambous|first=Yannis|title=Fonts & Encodings|url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC&lpg=PA237&pg=PA411#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=28 November 2007|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|isbn=9780596102425}}\n* {{citation |last1=Lawson |first1=Alexander|year=1990 |title=Anatomy of a Typeface|publisher= [[David R.

They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.\n\nSans-serif fonts have become the most prevalent for display of text on computer screens. On lower-resolution digital displays, fine details like serifs may disappear or appear too large. The term comes from the French word ''sans'', meaning \"without\" and \"serif\" of uncertain origin, possibly from the Dutch word ''schreef'' meaning \"line\" or pen-stroke. In printed media, they are more commonly used for [[Display typeface|display use]] and less for [[body text]].\n\nBefore the term \"sans-serif\" became common in English typography, a number of other terms had been used. One of these outmoded terms for sans serif was [[East Asian gothic typeface|gothic]], which is still used in East Asian typography and sometimes seen in font names like [[News Gothic]], [[Highway Gothic]], or [[Trade Gothic]].\n\nSans-serif fonts are sometimes, especially in older documents, used as a device for [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], due to their typically blacker [[type color]].\n\n=={{anchor|Classification}} Classification==<!-- This section is linked from [[Serif]] -->\n\n{{Details|Vox-ATypI classification#Lineal}} \nFor the purposes of type classification, sans-serif designs are usually divided into three or four major groups, the fourth being the result of splitting the ''grotesque'' category into grotesque and neo-grotesque.<ref name=PJIM /><ref name=BS_2961 />\n\n===Grotesque===\n[[File:Akzidenz Grotesk Regular & Italic.svg|thumb|Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk, pangram specimen|[[Akzidenz Grotesk]], originally released by [[Berthold Type Foundry|H.

A typical neo-grotesque.]]\nAs the name implies, these modern designs consist of a direct evolution of grotesque types. They are relatively straightforward in appearance with limited width variation. Unlike earlier grotesque designs, many were issued in extremely large and versatile families from the time of release, making them easier to use for body text. Similar to grotesque typefaces, neo grotesques often feature capitals of uniform width and a quite 'folded-up' design, in which strokes (for example on the 'c') are curved all the way round to end on a perfect horizontal or vertical. [[Helvetica]] is an example of this. Others such as [[Univers]] are less regular.\n\nNeo-grotesque type began in the 1950s with the emergence of the [[International Typographic Style]], or Swiss style. Its members looked at the clear lines of [[Akzidenz Grotesk]] (1898) as an inspiration to create rational, almost neutral typefaces. In 1957 the release of [[Helvetica]], [[Univers]], and [[Folio (typeface)|Folio]], the first typefaces categorized as neo-grotesque, had a strong impact internationally: Helvetica came to be the most used typeface for the following decades.{{sfn|Meggs|2011|pp=376-377}}{{efn|Digital publishing expert Florian Hardwig describes the main features of neo-grotesques as being \"consistent details and even text colour.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |user=hardwig |number=1140368448482172928 |date=16 June 2019 |title=The mid-20th century saw a reappraisal of these classic sans serif forms.

However, [[Roman square capitals]], the inspiration for much Latin-alphabet lettering throughout history, had prominent serifs. While simple sans-serif letters have always been common in \"uncultured\" writing and sometimes even in epigraphy, such as basic handwriting, most artistically created letters in the Latin alphabet, both sculpted and printed, since the Middle Ages have been inspired by fine calligraphy, [[blackletter]] writing and [[Roman square capitals]].

Perhaps the first use of the term was due to the Boston Type and Stereotype Foundry, which in 1837 published a set of non-serifed typefaces under that name. It is believed that those were the first sans serif designs to be introduced in America.{{sfn|Lawson|1990|p=295}} The term probably derived from the architectural definition, which is neither Greek nor Roman,<ref>[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/gothic/oed.html OED Definition of Gothic]</ref> and from the extended adjective term of \"Germany\", which was the place where sans-serif typefaces became popular in the 19th to 20th centuries.<ref>[http://www.linotype.com/en/795/thesansseriftypefaces.html The Sans Serif Typefaces]</ref> Early adopters for the term includes Miller & Richard (1863), J.&nbsp;&&nbsp;R.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Wood (1865), Lothian, Conner, Bruce McKellar. Although the usage is now rare in the English-speaking world, the term is commonly used in Japan and South Korea; in China they are known by the term '''[[East Asian gothic typeface|heiti]]''' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u9ad4}}), literally meaning \"black type\", which is probably derived from the mistranslation of Gothic as blackletter typeface, even though actual blackletter fonts have serifs.\n\n===Recents===\n*'''Lineale''', or '''linear''': The term was defined by [[Maximilien Vox]] in the [[VOX-ATypI classification]] to describe sans-serif types. Later, in [[British Standards]] Classification of Typefaces ([[BS 2961]]:1967), lineale replaced sans-serif as classification name.\n*'''Simplices''': In Jean Alessandrini's ''d\u00e9signations pr\u00e9liminaries'' (preliminary designations), ''simplices'' (plain typefaces) is used to describe sans-serif on the basis that the name 'lineal' refers to lines, whereas, in reality, all typefaces are made of lines, including those that are not lineals.{{sfn|Haralambous|2007|p=411}}\n*'''Swiss''': It is used as a synonym to sans-serif, as opposed to ''roman'' (serif).

There is some contrast in thickness of strokes. They have squareness of curve, and curling close-set jaws. The R usually has a curled leg and the G is spurred. The ends of the curved strokes are usually oblique. Examples include the [[Grotesque (Stephenson Blake typefaces)|Stephenson Blake Grotesques]], Condensed Sans No. 7, Monotype Headline Bold.\n<br/>\n'''Neo-grotesque''': Lineale typefaces derived from the grotesque. They have less stroke contrast and are more regular in design. The jaws are more open than in the true grotesque and the g is often open-tailed. The ends of the curved strokes are usually horizontal. Examples include Edel/Wotan, [[Univers]], [[Helvetica]].\n<br/>\n'''Humanist''': Lineale typefaces based on the proportions of inscriptional Roman capitals and Humanist or Garalde lower-case, rather than on early grotesques. They have some stroke contrast, with two-storey a and g. Examples include [[Optima]], [[Gill Sans]], Pascal.\n<br/>\n'''Geometric''': Lineale typefaces constructed on simple geometric shapes, circle or rectangle. Usually monoline, and often with single-storey a. Examples include [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]], [[Erbar]], [[Eurostile]].\n</ref>\n<ref name=PJIM>{{cite journal |last= Childers|first= |last2= Griscti|first2= |last3= Leben|first3= |date= January 2013 |title= 25 Systems for Classifying Typography: A Study in Naming Frequency\n|url= http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/issues/2013/01/pdfs/ParsonsJournalForInformationMapping_Childers_Griscti_Leben.pdf\n|journal= The Parsons Journal for Information Mapping|publisher= The Parsons Institute for Information Mapping |volume= V |issue= 1|pages= |doi= |accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=behrens>{{citation\n | title=Feste des Lebens und der Kunst: eine Betrachtung des Theaters als h\u00f6chsten Kultursymbols\n | last1 = Behrens | first1= Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Behrens\n | url=https://archive.org/details/festedeslebensun00behr\n | year=1900\n | language=German\n | publisher=Eugen Diederichs\n}}</ref><ref name=nymphgrot>James Mosley, ''The Nymph and the Grot: the revival of the sanserif letter'', London: Friends of the St Bride Printing Library, 1999</ref><ref name=nymphgrot_update>{{Citation\n| url   = http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html\n| title = The Nymph and the Grot, an update\n| last1 = Mosley | first1= James\n| date   = January 6, 2007\n| accessdate = June 10, 2014\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140610132607/http://typefoundry.blogspot.it/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html\n|archivedate= June 10, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n<!-- unused reference\n<ref name=lupton>{{citation|first1=Ellen |last1= Lupton|title=Thinking with Type|url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=oz1FAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2010|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|isbn=978-1-61689-045-2|edition=2nd|page=46}}</ref>\n-->\n\n}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n| title= The Elements of Typographic Style\n| authorlink1= Robert Bringhurst \n| last1 = Bringhurst \n| first1= Robert \n| isbn=9780881792065\n| url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=940sAAAAYAAJ\n| year=2004\n| publisher=[[Hartley & Marks Publishers]]\n| edition  = 3rd}}\n\n* {{citation|last=Haralambous|first=Yannis|title=Fonts & Encodings|url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC&lpg=PA237&pg=PA411#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=28 November 2007|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|isbn=9780596102425}}\n* {{citation |last1=Lawson |first1=Alexander|year=1990 |title=Anatomy of a Typeface|publisher= [[David R.

'''5000-metre run''' (approximately 3.1&nbsp;mi or 16,404&nbsp;ft) is a common [[long-distance running]] event in [[track and field]]. It is one of the track events in the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[World Championships in Athletics]], run over 12.5 laps of a standard track. The same distance in [[road running]] is called a [[5K run]].\nThe 5000&nbsp;m has been present on the Olympic programme since 1912 for men and since 1996 for women. Prior to 1996, women had competed in an Olympic [[3000 metres]] race since 1984. The 5000&nbsp;m has been held at each of the [[World Championships in Athletics]] in men's competition and since 1995 in women's.\n\nThe event is almost the same length as the [[Dolichos (running race)|dolichos race]] held at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], introduced in 720 BCE. While mainly run as an outdoor event, the 5000&nbsp;m is sometimes run on an indoor track. The [[IAAF]] keeps official records for both outdoor and indoor 5000-metre track events.<ref name=\"iaaf_5000out\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/inout=O/discType=5/disc=5000/detail.html |title=\u2013 5000 Metre Records \u2013 Outdoor |publisher=Iaaf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/records/inout=I/discType=5/disc=5000/detail.html |title=\u2013 5000 Metre Records \u2013 Indoor |publisher=Iaaf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-25}}</ref>\n\n==3 miles==\n5000 metres is the slightly longer metric derivative of the 3-mile run, an event common in countries when they were using the [[Imperial units|imperial measurement system]]. 3 miles was used in the [[Athletics at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] until 1966 and was a [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|championship in the United States]] in non-Olympic years from 1953 to 1973.
