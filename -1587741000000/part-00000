To win a bet, Cartman convinces the reenactors to try and alter history and leads them throughout the southern United States.

He also takes the time to remind everyone that the primary [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] sponsor of their event is [[Jagermeister|Jagerminz]] [[S'mores|S'more]]-flavored [[Schnapps]], \"the [[schnapps]] with the delightful taste of [[s'mores]].\" In addition, the special guest will be [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s grandpa, [[Recurring South Park characters#Randall \"Randy\" and Sharon Marsh, Shelley and Grandpa|Marvin Marsh]]. Meanwhile, [[Cartman]] comes dressed as [[Robert E. Lee|General Robert E. Lee]], and the boys are outraged by his dressing as a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] officer. Evidently under the impression that the reenactment is a competition of some sort, Cartman bets that the South will win the Civil War, and if it does, [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] will be his [[slavery|slaves]] for a month, or vice versa. Knowing that the outcome is supposed to be historical victory for the North as planned, Stan and Kyle eagerly accept the challenge.\n\nCartman manipulates the drunken Confederate reenactors into actually striving to win the reenactment. At the after party, all of the reenactors, Confederate and Unionist, are now drunk on the Schnapps, Cartman rallies them to attack [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], which is presumed by the reenactors to have been the next battle. The next day, Topeka is assaulted by the drunken South Park Confederates and the entire town falls. As the invasion continues town by town, their ranks are continually bolstered by either Confederate supporters or men who would simply choose to avoid fighting them. Stan, Kyle, and Grampa Marsh travel to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] which is under attack by the Confederates. The National Guard also arrives on the scene and shoots a warning flare into the air which kills [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] (who had joined the Confederates under Cartman's promise of \"lots of plunder and womens\").\n\nThe boys hatch a plan to rid the army of their primary fuel, the S'More Schnapps. The army soon wakes up with raging hangovers and quickly disbands, but Cartman calls the J\u00e4germinz company, who deliver to the entire army truckloads of alcohol. With the men drunk again, the next target of the Confederates is [[Fort Sumter]]. Though they easily overrun and secure the fort, they are then faced with the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. The latter is defeated with help from Confederate reinforcements made up of the entire population of [[South Carolina]].\n\nFinally the Confederate Army reaches [[Washington, D.C.]]. The army demands the Confederate States of America to be a separate country and blackmail [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] by threatening to release a (bluff) video of him with [[Marisa Tomei]]. Grandpa, realizing that the drunken men still think that the entire campaign is a reenactment, gets Stan and Kyle dressed up as [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], just in time to prevent [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] from signing the surrender, with the added condition that the South receive a free year's supply of Schnapps. The entire army breaks up happily and leaves upon surrender to Cartman's dismay.\n\nStan and Kyle are deciding what to make Cartman do, having won the bet, but their triumph is short-lived. Cartman is saved from the terms of the bet after remembering the North still won the war, and that slavery was abolished because of it. President Clinton makes this clear by pointing out that the abolition of slavery was one of the significant outcomes of the Civil War, making slavery illegal and the bet nullified. Angered by this, Stan and Kyle insult Clinton before walking away, embittered.\n\n==Production==\nAfter the production of the previous episode, the voice actor of many female ''South Park'' roles, [[Mary Kay Bergman]], committed suicide. Parker and Stone, still in shock from her death, did not feel like auditioning people right away, which is why this episode features no female voices (Trey Parker voices the S'mores Schnapps Lady and the schoolteacher in Topeka, and Kenny's mother appears with no speaking parts).<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2012 |title=South Park: The Complete Fifteenth Season: \"The Red Badge of Gayness\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nThe episode parodies the film ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' which Parker and Stone disliked.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn 2013, fans voted \"The Red Badge of Gayness\" as the best episode of [[South Park (season 3)|Season 3]].<ref>[http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer-of-south-park/season-3 \"Summer of South Park Season 3\"].

Caesar and Antony must balance that which is expedient with how their actions will appear to the people. Atia's jealousy of Servilia will lead to actions that spell humiliation for Caesar, and despair for Servilia. A sudden reversal of fortune forces Vorenus to choose whether it is to the Legions or the underworld of Rome that he will sell his integrity. Servilia's rage turns her into dark paths of revenge. Niobe faces the possibility of having to lose her son, and has her secret fall into the hands of those who do not know what to do with it. Pullo is retained to educate Octavian, but it is questionable as to who will teach and who will learn.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Pompey]] receives [[Julius Caesar]]'s offer of a truce. To general surprise, he accepts. This presents Caesar with a dilemma, since he confidently expected Pompey to refuse, but now needs a suitable pretext to reject a truce. Caesar uses Pompey's refusal to meet with him face-to-face, calling it a mortal insult.\n\n[[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] announces that she has retained [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]] to tutor her son [[Octavian]] in the \"masculine arts\" \u2014 how to fight, copulate, skin animals and so forth. Octavian proves to be an indifferent swordsman, but takes a liking to Pullo, and the soldier takes the boy into his confidence, confessing that he has suspicions about [[Niobe of the Voreni|Niobe]] and her brother-in-law, Evander. The two make a pact to find out the truth, without telling [[Lucius Vorenus]].\n\nMeanwhile, Vorenus's financial difficulties are mounting. He inspects his share of the slaves taken in Gaul, and finds that nearly all of them have died of disease, on top of which he still has to pay the bill for their transport and feeding. He asks [[Erastes Fulmen]] for a loan, but the crafty gangster demurs, and instead maneuvers Lucius into accepting a lucrative position as his enforcer.\n\nHaving captured the city, Caesar seems to be in no hurry to pursue Pompey to the coast, instead spending his evenings dallying with [[Servilia of the Junii|Servilia]]. Jealous of her influence over Caesar, Atia hires [[Timon (Rome character)|Timon]] to paint rude graffiti depicting Caesar and Servilia's relationship all over the city. Mortified, Caesar's wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]] threatens to divorce him unless he breaks off relations with Servilia. Since he still needs her family's political and financial support, Caesar does so, and Servilia is livid. Caesar prepares to march on Pompey without further ado, and appoints [[Mark Antony]] prefect of the city in his absence, despite the latter's protests (\"I'm a soldier, not a peacekeeper\").\n\nLate at night, Pullo kidnaps Evander, with Octavian tagging along, and they interrogate him in an underground walkway beside one of the sewers. Octavian, to Pullo's surprise, directs Pullo to torture Evander when he refuses to talk with surprising blood lust and cruelty. After losing both thumbs and being beaten severely, Evander admits that he and Niobe had become lovers after Vorenus was mistakenly pronounced dead in Gaul, and that Niobe's \"grandson\" is in fact her son by him. Outraged, Pullo kills Evander and dumps his body into the sewer. Octavian warns him that Vorenus can never learn what has happened.\n\nVorenus reports for duty as Erastes's \"bodyguard,\" but quits as soon as he sees what is expected of him: torturing, and then killing, a business client of Fulmen's who considered himself cheated in a recent deal.\n\nDespite his political opposition to Caesar, Vorenus has no choice but to approach Antony, pleading for a renewal of Antony's prior offer. Antony does not usually believe in second chances, but he needs good men around him in his new, unfamiliar role as city protector. Vorenus is reinstated into the army as [[Evocati]] prefect (with a cut in his promised signing bonus).\n\nIn the most solemn terms, Servilia inscribes [[curse tablet]]s against both Caesar and Atia, and a slave deposits them in their respective houses. She is now committed to destroying both of them.\n\nCaesar and his army reach the coast to find that they are too late: Pompey has escaped to [[Greece]], no doubt to raise a new army against Caesar.\n\n==Historical and cultural background==\n* The title of the episode is a phrase used by [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] advocating \"no mercy\" toward [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus (Rome character)|Pompey]] and the [[Optimates]]. The phrase is English translation of the [[Latin]] \"''Murum aries attigit''\" (see ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Caes.+Gal.+2.32 Book II, Chapter XXXII]). It refers to the policy of not allowing any mercy or surrender to the occupants of a [[fortification]] once the [[battering ram]] begins the assault on the gates. This policy was to act as a deterrent against resistance to those about to be besieged. It was an incentive for anyone who was not ''absolutely sure'' that they could withstand the assault to surrender immediately, rather than face the possibility of total destruction.\n* [[Posca (Rome character)|Posca]] mentions that [[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Caesar]] ''cannot'' allow his wife to divorce him\u2014her family's influence is critical. [[Calpurnia (Rome character)|Calpurnia]] was ''[[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]]'', daughter of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]]. That would make her father an ex-[[consul]] of Rome, as well as an ex-[[proconsul]] of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]\u2014clearly a man of political experience and influence. [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]] was instrumental in having [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] exiled from Rome for a period in 58 BC and 57 BC. This fact may explain part of the animosity [[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] bears towards Caesar and his family.\n* Towards the end of the episode, [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]] re-enlists with the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]], and is inducted into the ranks of the evocati, who were \"career\" soldiers who had re-enlisted in the legions after their original \"term of service\" was up\u2014usually at the request of their commander. The [[evocati]] tended to occupy the higher-ranking positions within the Legion, were released from some of the more menial duties, and were awarded a certain level of respect and higher pay.\n* A displeased Mark Antony reduces [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus's]] [[signing bonus]] to 9,000 [[Sestertius|sestertii]]\u2014or 2,250 [[Denarius|denarii]]\u2014when Vorenus returns to him. The value of the [[Denarius]] is discussed in ''[[How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Republic#Historical and cultural background|How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Republic]]'', but 2,250 denarii would be roughly equal to [[United States Dollar|USD]] $225,000. (The significance of the reduction may be that this is Antony's final offer\u2014Vorenus's last chance.)\n* Mark Antony promotes Lucius Vorenus to the rank of \"Prefect, of the first grade\". It is not clear what rank is being awarded here. The rank of [[Prefect]] within the legion was roughly that of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]]\u2014they occupied positions of authority over a particular aspect of the entire Legion (''Praefectus castrorum'' = camp commandant, ''Praefectus fabrum'' = officer in charge of engineers and artisans, ''Praefectus legionis'' = equestrian legionary commander, etc.). Regardless of his specific area of responsibility upon re-enlisting in the 13th, Vorenus's new rank is a ''three-grade'' promotion.\n* As part of his induction into the ''evocati'', Vorenus\u2014in full dress armor\u2014sits a [[vigil]] in the temple of [[Mars (god)|Mars]], Roman god of [[War]].\n\n==Episode characters==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]] ([[Kevin McKidd]])\n* [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]] ([[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]])\n* [[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Gaius Julius Caesar]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]])\n* [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus (Rome character)|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] ([[Kenneth Cranham]])\n* [[Atia of the Julii]] ([[Polly Walker]])\n* [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Marcus Antonius]] ([[James Purefoy]])\n* [[Marcus Junius Brutus (Rome character)|Marcus Junius Brutus]] ([[Tobias Menzies]])\n* [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] ([[Lindsay Duncan]])\n* [[Niobe of the Voreni|Niobe]] ([[Indira Varma]])\n* [[Gaius Octavian (Rome character)|Gaius Octavian]] ([[Max Pirkis]])\n* [[Octavia of the Julii]] ([[Kerry Condon]])\n* Quintus Pompeius ([[Rick Warden]])\n* [[Cato the Younger (Rome character)|Marcus Porcius Cato]] ([[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]])\n* [[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] ([[David Bamber]])\n* [[Timon (Rome character)|Timon]] ([[Lee Boardman]])\n* [[Eirene (Rome character)|Eirene]] ([[Chiara Mastalli]])\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|episode=The Ram Has Touched the Wall|id=0688356}}\n\n{{Rome (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ram Has Touched the Wall, The}}\n[[Category:2005 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:2005 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Rome (TV series) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = The Ram Has Touched the Wall\n| series       = [[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 1\n| episode      = 5\n| writer       = [[Bruno Heller]]\n| director     = [[Allen Coulter]]\n| airdate      = September 25, 2005 ([[HBO]])<br />November 23, 2005 ([[BBC]])<!--\n-->{{Infobox|child=yes\n| label1 = Setting\n| data1  = [[Rome]] and [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]]\n| label2 = Time frame\n| data2  = Between January 10 \u2013 February 30, 49 BC\n}}\n| length       = \n| season_list  = \n| prev         = [[Stealing from Saturn]]\n| next         = [[Egeria (Rome)|Egeria]]\n| episode_list = List of Rome episodes\n}}\n\"'''The Ram Has Touched the Wall'''\" is the fifth [[episode]] of the first season of the television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.\n\nPompey must stall for time, and his supporters urge for peace with Caesar.

Caesar uses Pompey's refusal to meet with him face-to-face, calling it a mortal insult.\n\n[[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] announces that she has retained [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]] to tutor her son [[Octavian]] in the \"masculine arts\" \u2014 how to fight, copulate, skin animals and so forth. Octavian proves to be an indifferent swordsman, but takes a liking to Pullo, and the soldier takes the boy into his confidence, confessing that he has suspicions about [[Niobe of the Voreni|Niobe]] and her brother-in-law, Evander. The two make a pact to find out the truth, without telling [[Lucius Vorenus]].\n\nMeanwhile, Vorenus's financial difficulties are mounting. He inspects his share of the slaves taken in Gaul, and finds that nearly all of them have died of disease, on top of which he still has to pay the bill for their transport and feeding. He asks [[Erastes Fulmen]] for a loan, but the crafty gangster demurs, and instead maneuvers Lucius into accepting a lucrative position as his enforcer.\n\nHaving captured the city, Caesar seems to be in no hurry to pursue Pompey to the coast, instead spending his evenings dallying with [[Servilia of the Junii|Servilia]]. Jealous of her influence over Caesar, Atia hires [[Timon (Rome character)|Timon]] to paint rude graffiti depicting Caesar and Servilia's relationship all over the city. Mortified, Caesar's wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]] threatens to divorce him unless he breaks off relations with Servilia. Since he still needs her family's political and financial support, Caesar does so, and Servilia is livid. Caesar prepares to march on Pompey without further ado, and appoints [[Mark Antony]] prefect of the city in his absence, despite the latter's protests (\"I'm a soldier, not a peacekeeper\").\n\nLate at night, Pullo kidnaps Evander, with Octavian tagging along, and they interrogate him in an underground walkway beside one of the sewers. Octavian, to Pullo's surprise, directs Pullo to torture Evander when he refuses to talk with surprising blood lust and cruelty. After losing both thumbs and being beaten severely, Evander admits that he and Niobe had become lovers after Vorenus was mistakenly pronounced dead in Gaul, and that Niobe's \"grandson\" is in fact her son by him. Outraged, Pullo kills Evander and dumps his body into the sewer. Octavian warns him that Vorenus can never learn what has happened.\n\nVorenus reports for duty as Erastes's \"bodyguard,\" but quits as soon as he sees what is expected of him: torturing, and then killing, a business client of Fulmen's who considered himself cheated in a recent deal.\n\nDespite his political opposition to Caesar, Vorenus has no choice but to approach Antony, pleading for a renewal of Antony's prior offer. Antony does not usually believe in second chances, but he needs good men around him in his new, unfamiliar role as city protector. Vorenus is reinstated into the army as [[Evocati]] prefect (with a cut in his promised signing bonus).\n\nIn the most solemn terms, Servilia inscribes [[curse tablet]]s against both Caesar and Atia, and a slave deposits them in their respective houses. She is now committed to destroying both of them.\n\nCaesar and his army reach the coast to find that they are too late: Pompey has escaped to [[Greece]], no doubt to raise a new army against Caesar.\n\n==Historical and cultural background==\n* The title of the episode is a phrase used by [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] advocating \"no mercy\" toward [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus (Rome character)|Pompey]] and the [[Optimates]]. The phrase is English translation of the [[Latin]] \"''Murum aries attigit''\" (see ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Caes.+Gal.+2.32 Book II, Chapter XXXII]). It refers to the policy of not allowing any mercy or surrender to the occupants of a [[fortification]] once the [[battering ram]] begins the assault on the gates. This policy was to act as a deterrent against resistance to those about to be besieged. It was an incentive for anyone who was not ''absolutely sure'' that they could withstand the assault to surrender immediately, rather than face the possibility of total destruction.\n* [[Posca (Rome character)|Posca]] mentions that [[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Caesar]] ''cannot'' allow his wife to divorce him\u2014her family's influence is critical. [[Calpurnia (Rome character)|Calpurnia]] was ''[[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]]'', daughter of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]]. That would make her father an ex-[[consul]] of Rome, as well as an ex-[[proconsul]] of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]\u2014clearly a man of political experience and influence. [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]] was instrumental in having [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] exiled from Rome for a period in 58 BC and 57 BC. This fact may explain part of the animosity [[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] bears towards Caesar and his family.\n* Towards the end of the episode, [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]] re-enlists with the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]], and is inducted into the ranks of the evocati, who were \"career\" soldiers who had re-enlisted in the legions after their original \"term of service\" was up\u2014usually at the request of their commander. The [[evocati]] tended to occupy the higher-ranking positions within the Legion, were released from some of the more menial duties, and were awarded a certain level of respect and higher pay.\n* A displeased Mark Antony reduces [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus's]] [[signing bonus]] to 9,000 [[Sestertius|sestertii]]\u2014or 2,250 [[Denarius|denarii]]\u2014when Vorenus returns to him. The value of the [[Denarius]] is discussed in ''[[How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Republic#Historical and cultural background|How Titus Pullo Brought Down the Republic]]'', but 2,250 denarii would be roughly equal to [[United States Dollar|USD]] $225,000. (The significance of the reduction may be that this is Antony's final offer\u2014Vorenus's last chance.)\n* Mark Antony promotes Lucius Vorenus to the rank of \"Prefect, of the first grade\". It is not clear what rank is being awarded here. The rank of [[Prefect]] within the legion was roughly that of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]]\u2014they occupied positions of authority over a particular aspect of the entire Legion (''Praefectus castrorum'' = camp commandant, ''Praefectus fabrum'' = officer in charge of engineers and artisans, ''Praefectus legionis'' = equestrian legionary commander, etc.). Regardless of his specific area of responsibility upon re-enlisting in the 13th, Vorenus's new rank is a ''three-grade'' promotion.\n* As part of his induction into the ''evocati'', Vorenus\u2014in full dress armor\u2014sits a [[vigil]] in the temple of [[Mars (god)|Mars]], Roman god of [[War]].\n\n==Episode characters==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]] ([[Kevin McKidd]])\n* [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]] ([[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]])\n* [[Gaius Julius Caesar (Rome character)|Gaius Julius Caesar]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]])\n* [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus (Rome character)|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] ([[Kenneth Cranham]])\n* [[Atia of the Julii]] ([[Polly Walker]])\n* [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Marcus Antonius]] ([[James Purefoy]])\n* [[Marcus Junius Brutus (Rome character)|Marcus Junius Brutus]] ([[Tobias Menzies]])\n* [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] ([[Lindsay Duncan]])\n* [[Niobe of the Voreni|Niobe]] ([[Indira Varma]])\n* [[Gaius Octavian (Rome character)|Gaius Octavian]] ([[Max Pirkis]])\n* [[Octavia of the Julii]] ([[Kerry Condon]])\n* Quintus Pompeius ([[Rick Warden]])\n* [[Cato the Younger (Rome character)|Marcus Porcius Cato]] ([[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]])\n* [[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] ([[David Bamber]])\n* [[Timon (Rome character)|Timon]] ([[Lee Boardman]])\n* [[Eirene (Rome character)|Eirene]] ([[Chiara Mastalli]])\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|episode=The Ram Has Touched the Wall|id=0688356}}\n\n{{Rome (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ram Has Touched the Wall, The}}\n[[Category:2005 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:2005 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Rome (TV series) episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ram_has_Touched_the_Wall"}

Written by [[Tim Minear]] and directed by [[Bruce Seth Green]], it was originally broadcast on February 22, 2000 on the [[Warner Brothers Network|WB]] [[television network|network]]. In this episode, [[Kate Lockley|Detective Kate Lockely]] learns her father has been spending his retirement as a mule for a syndicate of demon drug-runners. In response to investigative pressure from [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], the demon drug lord orders Kate's father killed. Flashbacks show the human Angel struggling with his own father in 1753, incorporating scenes first shown in the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' episode \"[[Becoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Becoming (Part 1)]]\", and remind viewers that Angel killed his family after being turned into a vampire by [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a flashback to [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], 1753, Angel - at that point, still human and known as \"Liam\"  - is fighting with his father. Enraged by his son's chronic recklessness and current mocking demeanor, Liam's father slaps his son in the face, shouting that he'll always be a layabout and a scoundrel. In the present, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] is fighting a demon that is dressed like a homeless person on the train tracks in an L.A. subway tunnel. As [[Kate Lockley|Detective Kate Lockley]] arrives on the scene, the demon clutches its chest, sinks to the ground and expires. Forced again to deal with L.A.'s dark side and Angel's place in it, Kate ironically wonders whether she should call the coroner or Hazardous Materials, while Angel tries to convince her not to report the supernatural aspects of this case. Later, as an officer interviews the Blue Circle courier who pulled the emergency cord after allegedly being attacked by \"your average Joe-stink homeless guy,\" Angel's instincts are immediately aroused when he spots Kate's dad, retired police detective Trevor Lockley, take a package from the crime scene.\n\nAt [[Angel Investigations]], Angel identifies the demon in one of [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]]'s reference books as a Kwaini demon, an inherently non-violent race. Angel visits Kate at the precinct, but as he explains that something must have set off the Kwaini demon in the subway, Kate interrupts, preferring that he say \"evil thing\" instead of \"demon.\" He is unable to convince Kate that the demon she saw dead in the subway is not an ''evil'' evil thing. Kate  is reluctant to admit that his news means that this case is not as routine as they initially believed. The [[Angel Investigations|AI]] team splits up to pursue their two leads. Angel, suspicious that the Blue Circle courier was on a train during his shift, follows him to an apartment building, where Trevor Lockley opens the door to the courier's knock and shoves a brown-wrapped package into the man's hands. Once the courier leaves, Angel confronts Trevor about the exchange, theorizing Trevor was returning the parcel he removed from the crime scene that morning. Intending to discover who Trevor is working for, Angel gives Kate's father a chance to come clean so they can take care of the problem without further police involvement. Taking umbrage at Angel's angry implication that he cares nothing for his daughter, Trevor tells Angel that he can't possibly interpret a father's actions, and slams the door in his face. After locating the Kwaini's body in the subway tunnel, Wesley performs an autopsy which reveals the demon was on drugs, and attacked the train because someone on board had more of the drug.\n\nIn Galway, Liam tearfully bids goodbye to his mother and younger sister, and exchanges more harsh words with his father. Making his way back to the pub, Liam spends the remainder of the day carousing wildly. An elegantly dressed [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] watches in fascination as a very drunk Liam brawls with beautiful abandon, besting several men in quick succession. That night, luring the vulnerable young man into a dark alley with promises of exotic experiences and places, Darla sires Liam, first biting him, then drawing her own blood for him to drink in turn. That night, Liam rises from his grave and is greeted by Darla. She watches as he morphs and kills his first human. Liam adopts the vampiric name 'Angelus' when his younger sister sees him coming home and mistakes him for an angel. Angelus subsequently kills nearly the entire population of his village, including his sister, mother, and father, but leaving a few alive so that they will spread the vampire's reputation.\n\nTwo men in suits visit Trevor Lockley to make sure he hasn't said anything to his daughter. Angel arrives to warn Trevor of the danger in which he's involved, but before he can convince Mr. Lockley to invite him inside, the men in suits reveal themselves as vampires and kill Trevor. Kate arrives and finds her father dead. She trails the vampires to the demon drug lord's base, then stakes the vampire who killed her father. Angel shows up and helps her fight and kill the remaining vampires and finally chops off the head of the lead demon. Kate walks away, saying that Angel doesn't know anything about losing a human father. Back in Angel's past, Darla finds that Angelus has killed all of his family. She reminds him that even though his father is dead, his memory will always haunt him. Kate visits her father's grave while Angel watches from the safety of the shadows.\n\n==Production details==\nWhen Liam rises from the grave, his breath (and Darla's) is clearly visible. Because vampires have no body heat, they are always at air temperature. Without a temperature differential, vapor cannot condense. Producer [[Tim Minear]] explains it was cold while they filmed this scene, shot on location at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] behind [[Paramount Pictures]], and there wasn't a large enough budget to remove the actors' breath digitally.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000042.html\n|title=ANGEL: Season One, Episode By Episode with Tim Minear, Part 4 |first=Edward |last=Gross |date=August 14, 2000  |accessdate=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Arc significance===\n* This is the first appearance of [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] ([[Julie Benz]]) on ''Angel''.

Ojeda was accompanied by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Juan de la Cosa]]. De La Cosa's [[Mappa Mundi]] of 1500 shows Bonaire and calls it ''Isla do Palo Brasil'' or \"Island of [[Brazilwood]]\". The Spanish conquerors decided that the three [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] were useless, and in 1515 the natives were forcibly deported to work as slaves in the copper mines of [[Santo Domingo]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]].<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n===Spanish period===\n{{Main|Spanish West Indies}}\n\nIn 1526, [[Juan de Ampies]] was appointed Spanish commander of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]]. He brought back some of the original Caquetio Indian inhabitants to Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao. Ampies also imported domesticated animals from [[Spain]], including cows, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs and sheep. The Spaniards thought that Bonaire could be used as a cattle plantation worked by natives. The cattle were raised for hides rather than meat. The Spanish inhabitants lived mostly in the inland town of [[Rincon, Bonaire|Rincon]] which was safe from pirate attack.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n===Dutch period===\n{{Main|Dutch Caribbean}}\nThe [[Dutch West India Company]] was founded in 1621. Starting in 1623, ships of the West India Company called at Bonaire to obtain meat, water and wood. The Dutch also abandoned some Spanish and Portuguese prisoners there, and these people founded the town of [[Antriol]], which is a contraction of Spanish ''al interior'' (English: ''inside''). The Dutch and the Spanish fought from 1568 to 1648 in what is now known as the [[Eighty Years War]]. In 1633, the Dutch{{Snd}} having lost the island of [[St. Maarten]] to the Spanish{{Snd}} retaliated by attacking Cura\u00e7ao, Bonaire and Aruba. Bonaire was conquered in March 1636. The Dutch built Fort Oranje in 1639.<ref>[[:nl:Fort Oranje (Bonaire)]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile Cura\u00e7ao emerged as a center of the [[slave trade]], Bonaire became a plantation of the Dutch West India Company. A small number of African slaves were put to work alongside Indians and convicts, cultivating dyewood and maize and harvesting solar [[edible salt|salt]] around Blue Pan. Slave quarters, built entirely of stone and too short for a man to stand upright in, still stand in the area around Rincon and along the saltpans. Historically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration; its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=Putte>''Dede piki\u00f1a ku su bisi\u00f1a: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd''. van Putte, Florimon., 1999.

The [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] were returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]]. During the period of British rule, a large number of white traders settled on Bonaire, and they built the settlement of Playa ([[Kralendijk]]) in 1810.\n\n===Emancipation===\nFrom 1816 until 1868, Bonaire remained a government plantation. In 1825, there were about 300 government-owned slaves on the island. Gradually many of the slaves were freed and became freemen with an obligation to render some services to the government. The remaining slaves were freed on 30 September 1862 under the Emancipation Regulation. A total of 607 government slaves and 151 private slaves were freed at that time.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the German occupation of the Netherlands during [[World War II]], Bonaire was a protectorate of Britain and the United States.

As the nearby continental shelf (now located near Montserrat, and the cause of the volcanic activity on that island) moved through the area, it forced a large mass of rock to the ocean surface and created the islands of the Lesser and Greater Antilles, including Bonaire. As the seabed rose a vast coral reef grew on what is now dry land. These corals were eventually exposed to air and perished, becoming surface limestone deposits over the millennia.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\"/>\n\nVast amounts of coral skeletons may be seen along the shoreline and across the interior of Bonaire. The island is essentially a coral reef that has been geologically pushed up and out of the sea. This also resulted in the natural fringing reef system seen today, in which the coral formations start at the shoreline. Tidal variations are only about {{convert|1.8|-|2.0|ft|cm}}, so the corals start at the low tide line and continue on, following the underwater topology of the island's base. Bonaire's tides are more affected by a combination of wind and low/ high-pressure systems than by the moon.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infobonaire.com/maps.html |title=Bonaire's Maps |publisher=InfoBonaire |date=2017-06-03 |accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nThe northern end of the island is relatively mountainous, although its highest peak ([[Brandaris, Bonaire|Brandaris]]) is only {{convert|240|m|abbr=off}}. The southern part of the island is nearly flat and barely rises above sea level. A significant portion of this southern region is covered with sea water in process of evaporation for salt production. This area also contains Lac Bay with its large mangrove forest. The shoreline of Bonaire is dotted with lagoons and inlets, the largest of which is Goto Lake in the north. These lagoons and wetlands provide an excellent habitat for a wide variety of shorebirds.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\"/>\n\nBonaire has a warm, dry (though humid) and windy climate. The average temperature is {{convert|81.5|F|C}} with a {{convert|2.5|F-change}} seasonal variation and {{convert|10|F-change}} daily variation. The ocean temperature around the island fluctuates between {{convert|78|and|86|F|C}}. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|96.4|F|C}} and the lowest, {{convert|67.6|F|C}}. Nearly constant winds blow from the east with an average speed of {{convert|12|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infobonaire.com/weather.html |title=Bonaire's Weather, provided by KNMI |publisher=InfoBonaire |date=2017-06-03 |accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nThe humidity is very constant, averaging 76% and fluctuating between 85% and 66% on a daily basis. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|20.5|in|mm}}, most of which occurs in October through January.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Bonaire lies outside the [[hurricane belt]], though its weather and oceanic conditions are occasionally affected by hurricanes and tropical storms. This semi-arid climate is conducive to a variety of cacti and other desert plants.\n\n[[Klein Bonaire]], the small island in the sheltered lee of Bonaire, has the same geological history. While Bonaire has some hills and variations in altitude, Klein Bonaire's surface is quite level and just a few feet above high tide. Because the island is as-yet undeveloped, the fringing reef system surrounding Klein Bonaire is truly pristine. The smaller island is entirely ringed with dive sites.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\"/>\n\nBonaire has a land area of {{convert|288|km2}}, while Klein Bonaire is an additional {{convert|6|km2|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[Washington Slagbaai National Park]] is an ecological preserve on the north side of the island.

Flamingos are drawn to the brackish water of the island's lagoons, which harbors the shrimp upon which they feed. Bonaire is home to one of only four nesting grounds for the Caribbean flamingo. Located in the Pekelmeer in the southern part of the island, no human entry is permitted in this sanctuary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcnanature.org/caribbean-flamingo-2/|title=Caribbean Flamingo|publisher=}}</ref> In the 16th century, Europeans introduced [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, pigs, [[horse]]s and donkeys on Bonaire, and the descendants of the donkeys, goats and pigs roam the island today.\n\nBonaire is also home to the ecologically vulnerable [[yellow-shouldered amazon]] parrot, ''Amazona barbadensis''.\n\n===Environmental initiatives===\nThe island of Bonaire has long been a leader in nature conservation and ecological responsibility. The national park foundation, Stichting Nationale Parken (STINAPA), was founded in 1962 for the purpose of actively protecting nature on the island. In 1969 STINAPA succeeded in establishing both the flamingo nesting sanctuary and Washington National Park, the first such nature preserves in the Caribbean. In 1979, the Slagbaai plantation was added to the park, now known as [[Washington Slagbaai National Park]] (WSNP). The [[Bonaire National Marine Park]] (BNMP) was also established in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stinapa.org/history.html|title=STINAPA Bonaire{{Snd}} National Parks Foundation|publisher=}}</ref> The Marine Park consists of the whole coastline of Bonaire from the high-water mark down to a depth of {{convert|200|ft}} and includes a large mangrove forest in Lac Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmp.org/index.html|title=STINAPA{{Snd}} Bonaire National Marine Park|publisher=}}</ref> Lac Bay, Klein Bonaire, Pekelmeer, Slagbaii and Gotomeer are recognized as wetlands of international significance under the [[Ramsar Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmp.org/ramsar.html|title=STINAPA{{Snd}} Bonaire National Marine Park|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDue to a public-private sector partnership, programs are being developed to advance the local awareness and attitudes toward conservation and habitat preservation in order to proactively protect Bonaire's ecosystem. A new sewage treatment plant will contribute to protecting the reefs and the seawater quality. In March 2013 Selibon NV,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilovebonaire.com/bonaire/en/services/other/selibon-nv|title=Page not found|website=I Love Bonaire}}</ref> the national garbage-processing plant, opened an environmental court where the general public can bring glass, cans, paper, scrap metal, cardboard, batteries, motor oil, cooking oil, electronics, mobile phones and textiles.\n\nBonRecycling BV<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilovebonaire.com/bonaire/en/services/other/bonrecycling|title=Page not found|website=I Love Bonaire}}</ref> is committed to recycling waste products in Bonaire and to create awareness among the people of Bonaire about the importance and benefits of recycling. Dive Friends Bonaire<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilovebonaire.com/bonaire/en/activities/diving/dive-friends-bonaire|title=Page not found|website=I Love Bonaire}}</ref> started a Debris Free Bonaire program that emphasises collecting debris washed ashore and delivering it to the dive shop for separation in preparation for handling by BonRecycling.\n\nBonaire gets a significant amount of its electricity from an array of twelve wind generators along its northeastern coastline which began operating in 2010. This renewable source now fills 40-45% of the island's electricity needs. Work continues in developing additional renewable sources of energy, including bio-diesel and solar, with the goal of becoming 100% reliant on renewables.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bunker|first1=Kaitlyn|title=Caribbean Island Says Goodbye Fossil Fuels, Hello 100% Renewable Electricity|url=http://ecowatch.com/2015/01/07/bonaire-goodbye-diesel-hello-renewable-energy/|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=2015-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://curacaochronicle.com/region/solar-pilot-project-at-barcadera-bonaire/|title=Solar pilot project at Barcadera Bonaire{{Snd}} Cura\u00e7ao Chronicle|website=curacaochronicle.com|date=2014-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n[[File:GOVERNMENT HOUSE, KRALENDIJK, BONAIRE.jpg|thumb|The local parliament and Council House in [[Kralendijk]]]]\n\n===2010 referendum===\n\nPrior to the 2010 referendum, the Netherlands Antilles (comprising the islands of Cura\u00e7ao, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten and Saba) were governed as a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the Dutch system of government with free elections held every four years.

As a result, the government of the Netherlands assumed the task of public administration of the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] or BES Islands comprising Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. The three islands acquired new status as \"special municipalities\" (''bijzondere gemeenten''), making them part of the Netherlands itself, a form of \"public body\" (''openbaar lichaam'') as outlined in article 134 of the Dutch Constitution. Special municipalities do not constitute part of a province.\n\nAs a special municipality, Bonaire is very much like ordinary Dutch municipalities in that it has a mayor, [[aldermen]] and a [[municipal council]], and is governed according to most Dutch laws. Antillean legislation remained in force after 10 October 2010, with the exception of those cases where Antillean law was replaced by Bonaire's municipal law. It was believed best for the island to not introduce the entire body of Dutch legislation at one time as it would cause confusion. Therefore, Dutch legislation is being introduced in stages. Bonaire retained its own unique culture while residents enjoy the same rights as Dutch citizens, including the right to vote in Dutch parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. Residents also have access to new or improved facilities and government benefits including, but not limited to, [[universal health care]]; improved health care facilities; better educational facilities with additional training for teachers, new teaching methods and new school buildings; social housing for low-income individuals and families; a centrally dispatched single police force, fire department and ambulance service.<ref name=\"GovernmentNL\">{{cite web | url=https://www.government.nl/issues/caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom/new-constitutional-order | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729042752/https://www.government.nl/issues/caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom/new-constitutional-order | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 29, 2012 | title=New Constitutional Order | publisher=Government of the Netherlands | work=Caribbean Parts of the Kingdom | date=April 22, 2013 | accessdate=December 7, 2014}}</ref> While the three islands are considered to be land of the Netherlands, they are not a part of the [[European Union]], therefore not subject to European Union Law.

With reference to Bonaire's 2004 referendum, the organization is of the opinion that such an arrangement was never the choice of the people. The Dutch Minister of Home Affairs and Kingdom Relations, [[Ronald Plasterk]], replied to the organization confirming that only the \"Island Councils in the Caribbean Netherlands have the authority to decide on holding a constitutional referendum, not the Dutch government.\" In response, the organization gathered more than 3,500 signatures in 2013 favoring a new referendum. In a letter to minister Plasterk, James Finies, chairman of Nos Ke Boneiru B\u00e8k, requested a \"new referendum under the right of self-determination\". Plasterk responded by advising Finies that preparations for the evaluation of the public entity structure had begun for 2015, but a \"possible change of the constitutional relations is not part of that evaluation\".<ref name=\"BP\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bearingpointcaribbean.com/dutch-minister-plasterk-consitutional-referendum-bes-island-affair/ | title=Dutch Minister Plasterk: Constitutional Referendum BES is Island Affair | publisher=Bearing Point Caribbean | work=Government News | date=August 18, 2014 | accessdate=December 7, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211024150/http://www.bearingpointcaribbean.com/dutch-minister-plasterk-consitutional-referendum-bes-island-affair/ | archive-date=2014-12-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Bonaire status referendum, 2015|new referendum]] took place on 18 December 2015.<ref>[http://www.bonairegov.nl/sites/default/files/uploads/2015010717.pdf Referendum bill], government of Bonaire, 9 October 2015</ref> 65% of the turnout voted that they were not happy with the current relationship between Bonaire and the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Posthumus|first1=Niels|title=Bonaire stemt tegen huidige band met Nederland|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/12/19/bonaire-stemt-tegen-huidige-band-met-nederland|publisher=NRC|accessdate=13 March 2016|date=19 December 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.smn-news.com/st-maarten-st-martin-news/24458-the-conference-on-the-political-future-of-the-dutch-administered-caribbean-having-met-at-bonaire-west-indies-on-1st-december-2016.html The Conference on the Political Future of the Dutch-Administered Caribbean, Having met at Bonaire, West Indies on 1st December 2016], St. Martin News Network, 15 December 2016</ref>\n\n===Currency===\n\nIn 2011 the BES Islands replaced their currency, the [[Netherlands Antillean guilder]] ({{Iso4217}}: ANG, symbol: \u0192), with the US dollar rather than replacing it with the [[euro]] which is used in the European Netherlands. The decision was based primarily on the needs for tourism and trade. Most countries and territories in the Caribbean use the dollar as their currency or have a currency linked to the dollar as legal tender. The guilder was [[currency peg|pegged]] to the US dollar for decades with an exchange rate of \u01921.79 = US$1.00.

In an effort to remove the risk, two plans were introduced. One plan prevents double taxation between the Netherlands (Europe) and the BES Islands while the other prevents double taxation between the BES Islands and third countries. The new regime will generate a total annual tax revenue estimated at $52 million which is equal to the current tax revenues on the three islands. The combined population of the three Islands is approximately 20,000 with about half that many being income-taxpayers.<ref name=\"GovernmentNL\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Economy of the Netherlands}}\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nBonaire's economy is mainly based on tourism, taking advantage of its warm, dry climate and natural environment. The island caters to scuba divers and snorkelers, as the surrounding coral reefs are well preserved and easily accessible from the shore.

The shallow Bay is on the windward side of the island, so trade winds are strong and constant. A barrier reef across the mouth of the bay allows windsurfers of all skill levels to select wave conditions they like. Lac Bay is one of the stops in the PWA Windsurfing Freestyle World Cup and has hosted the Prokids IFCA Championship.

Presently operated by [[Cargill]], Bonaire's solar salt works produces 400,000 tons of industrial grade salt per year. After collection, the salt is then washed and stored in pyramid-shaped piles roughly 50 feet in height, each containing approximately 10,000 metric tons of 99.6 percent pure salt. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Micallef |first1=Joseph |title=The Surprising Story of Bonaire's Salt Pyramids |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2019/04/18/the-surprising-story-of-bonaires-salt-pyramids/#7ba89f366adf |accessdate=28 November 2019 |agency=Forbes |date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> The salt facility operates its own pier where ships are loaded with salt destined for North American, European and Western Pacific markets.

The airport proved to be too small when American soldiers arrived on Bonaire in the second half of 1943. The commander stated that a new airport had to be built. Construction began in December 1943, with the new \"Flamingo Airport\" opening in 1945. A small terminal was built that was suitable for the number of passengers at the time. This building was used until mid-1976. The airport had received many extensions of both the runway and the terminal itself.\n\nToday the airport is known as [[Flamingo International Airport]] and is served by a variety of both domestic and international airlines. Services from the US include Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines. Airlines providing European service include TUI Netherlands and KLM. Consistent air service from Cura\u00e7ao is available through Divi Divi Air and EZ Air.\n\nThe airport is equipped with a fire station, control tower and hangar.

Ojeda was accompanied by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Juan de la Cosa]]. De La Cosa's [[Mappa Mundi]] of 1500 shows Bonaire and calls it ''Isla do Palo Brasil'' or \"Island of [[Brazilwood]]\". The Spanish conquerors decided that the three [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] were useless, and in 1515 the natives were forcibly deported to work as slaves in the copper mines of [[Santo Domingo]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]].<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n===Spanish period===\n{{Main|Spanish West Indies}}\n\nIn 1526, [[Juan de Ampies]] was appointed Spanish commander of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]]. He brought back some of the original Caquetio Indian inhabitants to Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao. Ampies also imported domesticated animals from [[Spain]], including cows, donkeys, goats, horses, pigs and sheep. The Spaniards thought that Bonaire could be used as a cattle plantation worked by natives. The cattle were raised for hides rather than meat. The Spanish inhabitants lived mostly in the inland town of [[Rincon, Bonaire|Rincon]] which was safe from pirate attack.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n===Dutch period===\n{{Main|Dutch Caribbean}}\nThe [[Dutch West India Company]] was founded in 1621. Starting in 1623, ships of the West India Company called at Bonaire to obtain meat, water and wood. The Dutch also abandoned some Spanish and Portuguese prisoners there, and these people founded the town of [[Antriol]], which is a contraction of Spanish ''al interior'' (English: ''inside''). The Dutch and the Spanish fought from 1568 to 1648 in what is now known as the [[Eighty Years War]]. In 1633, the Dutch{{Snd}} having lost the island of [[St. Maarten]] to the Spanish{{Snd}} retaliated by attacking Cura\u00e7ao, Bonaire and Aruba. Bonaire was conquered in March 1636. The Dutch built Fort Oranje in 1639.<ref>[[:nl:Fort Oranje (Bonaire)]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile Cura\u00e7ao emerged as a center of the [[slave trade]], Bonaire became a plantation of the Dutch West India Company. A small number of African slaves were put to work alongside Indians and convicts, cultivating dyewood and maize and harvesting solar [[edible salt|salt]] around Blue Pan. Slave quarters, built entirely of stone and too short for a man to stand upright in, still stand in the area around Rincon and along the saltpans.

During the period of British rule, a large number of white traders settled on Bonaire, and they built the settlement of Playa ([[Kralendijk]]) in 1810.\n\n===Emancipation===\nFrom 1816 until 1868, Bonaire remained a government plantation. In 1825, there were about 300 government-owned slaves on the island. Gradually many of the slaves were freed and became freemen with an obligation to render some services to the government. The remaining slaves were freed on 30 September 1862 under the Emancipation Regulation. A total of 607 government slaves and 151 private slaves were freed at that time.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\n===World War II===\nDuring the German occupation of the Netherlands during [[World War II]], Bonaire was a protectorate of Britain and the United States.

As the nearby continental shelf (now located near Montserrat, and the cause of the volcanic activity on that island) moved through the area, it forced a large mass of rock to the ocean surface and created the islands of the Lesser and Greater Antilles, including Bonaire. As the seabed rose a vast coral reef grew on what is now dry land. These corals were eventually exposed to air and perished, becoming surface limestone deposits over the millennia.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\"/>\n\nVast amounts of coral skeletons may be seen along the shoreline and across the interior of Bonaire. The island is essentially a coral reef that has been geologically pushed up and out of the sea. This also resulted in the natural fringing reef system seen today, in which the coral formations start at the shoreline. Tidal variations are only about {{convert|1.8|-|2.0|ft|cm}}, so the corals start at the low tide line and continue on, following the underwater topology of the island's base. Bonaire's tides are more affected by a combination of wind and low/ high-pressure systems than by the moon.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infobonaire.com/maps.html |title=Bonaire's Maps |publisher=InfoBonaire |date=2017-06-03 |accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nThe northern end of the island is relatively mountainous, although its highest peak ([[Brandaris, Bonaire|Brandaris]]) is only {{convert|240|m|abbr=off}}. The southern part of the island is nearly flat and barely rises above sea level. A significant portion of this southern region is covered with sea water in process of evaporation for salt production. This area also contains Lac Bay with its large mangrove forest. The shoreline of Bonaire is dotted with lagoons and inlets, the largest of which is Goto Lake in the north. These lagoons and wetlands provide an excellent habitat for a wide variety of shorebirds.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\"/>\n\nBonaire has a warm, dry (though humid) and windy climate. The average temperature is {{convert|81.5|F|C}} with a {{convert|2.5|F-change}} seasonal variation and {{convert|10|F-change}} daily variation. The ocean temperature around the island fluctuates between {{convert|78|and|86|F|C}}. The highest recorded temperature is {{convert|96.4|F|C}} and the lowest, {{convert|67.6|F|C}}.

Average annual rainfall is {{convert|20.5|in|mm}}, most of which occurs in October through January.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Bonaire lies outside the [[hurricane belt]], though its weather and oceanic conditions are occasionally affected by hurricanes and tropical storms. This semi-arid climate is conducive to a variety of cacti and other desert plants.\n\n[[Klein Bonaire]], the small island in the sheltered lee of Bonaire, has the same geological history. While Bonaire has some hills and variations in altitude, Klein Bonaire's surface is quite level and just a few feet above high tide. Because the island is as-yet undeveloped, the fringing reef system surrounding Klein Bonaire is truly pristine. The smaller island is entirely ringed with dive sites.<ref name=\"infobonaire.com\"/>\n\nBonaire has a land area of {{convert|288|km2}}, while Klein Bonaire is an additional {{convert|6|km2|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[Washington Slagbaai National Park]] is an ecological preserve on the north side of the island.

The entire coastline of the island was designated a [[marine sanctuary]] in 1979, an effort to preserve and protect the delicate coral reef and the marine life that depends on it. There are more than 350 species of fish<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismbonaire.com/bonaire-diving|title=Bonaire divers paradise{{Snd}} Diving{{Snd}} Bonaire Official Tourism Site|publisher=}}</ref> and sixty species of coral living in Bonaire's reef.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmp.org/index-2.html#ecosystems|title=STINAPA{{Snd}} Bonaire National Marine Park|publisher=}}</ref> Boulder Star Coral (''[[Montastraea annularis]]'') is the most common coral, according to a 2011 survey.<ref name=Jekielek2011>{{cite journal |author=Jekielek, P |title=A 'BLAGRRA' Assessment of Coral Bleaching and Disease in Bonaire |journal=In: Pollock NW, Ed.

Flamingos are drawn to the brackish water of the island's lagoons, which harbors the shrimp upon which they feed. Bonaire is home to one of only four nesting grounds for the Caribbean flamingo. Located in the Pekelmeer in the southern part of the island, no human entry is permitted in this sanctuary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcnanature.org/caribbean-flamingo-2/|title=Caribbean Flamingo|publisher=}}</ref> In the 16th century, Europeans introduced [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, pigs, [[horse]]s and donkeys on Bonaire, and the descendants of the donkeys, goats and pigs roam the island today.\n\nBonaire is also home to the ecologically vulnerable [[yellow-shouldered amazon]] parrot, ''Amazona barbadensis''.\n\n===Environmental initiatives===\nThe island of Bonaire has long been a leader in nature conservation and ecological responsibility. The national park foundation, Stichting Nationale Parken (STINAPA), was founded in 1962 for the purpose of actively protecting nature on the island. In 1969 STINAPA succeeded in establishing both the flamingo nesting sanctuary and Washington National Park, the first such nature preserves in the Caribbean. In 1979, the Slagbaai plantation was added to the park, now known as [[Washington Slagbaai National Park]] (WSNP). The [[Bonaire National Marine Park]] (BNMP) was also established in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stinapa.org/history.html|title=STINAPA Bonaire{{Snd}} National Parks Foundation|publisher=}}</ref> The Marine Park consists of the whole coastline of Bonaire from the high-water mark down to a depth of {{convert|200|ft}} and includes a large mangrove forest in Lac Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmp.org/index.html|title=STINAPA{{Snd}} Bonaire National Marine Park|publisher=}}</ref> Lac Bay, Klein Bonaire, Pekelmeer, Slagbaii and Gotomeer are recognized as wetlands of international significance under the [[Ramsar Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmp.org/ramsar.html|title=STINAPA{{Snd}} Bonaire National Marine Park|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDue to a public-private sector partnership, programs are being developed to advance the local awareness and attitudes toward conservation and habitat preservation in order to proactively protect Bonaire's ecosystem. A new sewage treatment plant will contribute to protecting the reefs and the seawater quality. In March 2013 Selibon NV,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilovebonaire.com/bonaire/en/services/other/selibon-nv|title=Page not found|website=I Love Bonaire}}</ref> the national garbage-processing plant, opened an environmental court where the general public can bring glass, cans, paper, scrap metal, cardboard, batteries, motor oil, cooking oil, electronics, mobile phones and textiles.\n\nBonRecycling BV<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilovebonaire.com/bonaire/en/services/other/bonrecycling|title=Page not found|website=I Love Bonaire}}</ref> is committed to recycling waste products in Bonaire and to create awareness among the people of Bonaire about the importance and benefits of recycling.

This renewable source now fills 40-45% of the island's electricity needs. Work continues in developing additional renewable sources of energy, including bio-diesel and solar, with the goal of becoming 100% reliant on renewables.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bunker|first1=Kaitlyn|title=Caribbean Island Says Goodbye Fossil Fuels, Hello 100% Renewable Electricity|url=http://ecowatch.com/2015/01/07/bonaire-goodbye-diesel-hello-renewable-energy/|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=2015-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://curacaochronicle.com/region/solar-pilot-project-at-barcadera-bonaire/|title=Solar pilot project at Barcadera Bonaire{{Snd}} Cura\u00e7ao Chronicle|website=curacaochronicle.com|date=2014-01-20}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n[[File:GOVERNMENT HOUSE, KRALENDIJK, BONAIRE.jpg|thumb|The local parliament and Council House in [[Kralendijk]]]]\n\n===2010 referendum===\n\nPrior to the 2010 referendum, the Netherlands Antilles (comprising the islands of Cura\u00e7ao, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten and Saba) were governed as a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the Dutch system of government with free elections held every four years.

As a result, the government of the Netherlands assumed the task of public administration of the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] or BES Islands comprising Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba. The three islands acquired new status as \"special municipalities\" (''bijzondere gemeenten''), making them part of the Netherlands itself, a form of \"public body\" (''openbaar lichaam'') as outlined in article 134 of the Dutch Constitution. Special municipalities do not constitute part of a province.\n\nAs a special municipality, Bonaire is very much like ordinary Dutch municipalities in that it has a mayor, [[aldermen]] and a [[municipal council]], and is governed according to most Dutch laws. Antillean legislation remained in force after 10 October 2010, with the exception of those cases where Antillean law was replaced by Bonaire's municipal law. It was believed best for the island to not introduce the entire body of Dutch legislation at one time as it would cause confusion. Therefore, Dutch legislation is being introduced in stages. Bonaire retained its own unique culture while residents enjoy the same rights as Dutch citizens, including the right to vote in Dutch parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. Residents also have access to new or improved facilities and government benefits including, but not limited to, [[universal health care]]; improved health care facilities; better educational facilities with additional training for teachers, new teaching methods and new school buildings; social housing for low-income individuals and families; a centrally dispatched single police force, fire department and ambulance service.<ref name=\"GovernmentNL\">{{cite web | url=https://www.government.nl/issues/caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom/new-constitutional-order | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729042752/https://www.government.nl/issues/caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom/new-constitutional-order | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 29, 2012 | title=New Constitutional Order | publisher=Government of the Netherlands | work=Caribbean Parts of the Kingdom | date=April 22, 2013 | accessdate=December 7, 2014}}</ref> While the three islands are considered to be land of the Netherlands, they are not a part of the [[European Union]], therefore not subject to European Union Law.

Presently operated by [[Cargill]], Bonaire's solar salt works produces 400,000 tons of industrial grade salt per year. After collection, the salt is then washed and stored in pyramid-shaped piles roughly 50 feet in height, each containing approximately 10,000 metric tons of 99.6 percent pure salt. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Micallef |first1=Joseph |title=The Surprising Story of Bonaire's Salt Pyramids |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2019/04/18/the-surprising-story-of-bonaires-salt-pyramids/#7ba89f366adf |accessdate=28 November 2019 |agency=Forbes |date=April 18, 2019}}</ref> The salt facility operates its own pier where ships are loaded with salt destined for North American, European and Western Pacific markets.

This is the location of Bonaire's flamingo sanctuary.\n\n'''Oil storage and shipment''' \u2013 The Bonaire Petroleum Corporation (BOPEC) is a fuel oil storage and transshipment terminal on Bonaire. BOPEC is wholly owned by Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, and functions primarily as a storage facility for multiple grades of refined and non-refined oils from Venezuela and refineries on Cura\u00e7ao and Aruba. BOPEC also has mixing and blending capabilities for its stored fuels. BOPEC's #1 pier can receive tankers up to 500,000DWT,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocargo.com/ports_serviced_bonaire_bopec.html|title=Rocargo Services N.V.|publisher=}}</ref> which means there are only seven ships in the world that are too big for the BOPEC terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petroglobalnews.com/2013/08/the-top-ten-largest-oil-tankers-ever-built/|title=The Top Ten Largest Oil Tankers Ever Built|author=Harry Cassin|work=Petro Global News|date=2013-08-28}}</ref> A fire at the BOPEC terminal in 2010 is believed to have had a significant impact on Goto Lake and at least one other nearby lagoon.<ref>[http://www.rivm.nl/en/Documents_and_publications/Scientific/Reports/2013/maart/Follow_up_study_on_the_chemical_status_of_Lake_Goto_Bonaire_Measurements_and_risk_assessment Follow-up study on the chemical status of Lake Goto, Bonaire : Measurements and risk assessment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928081159/http://www.rivm.nl/en/Documents_and_publications/Scientific/Reports/2013/maart/Follow_up_study_on_the_chemical_status_of_Lake_Goto_Bonaire_Measurements_and_risk_assessment |date=2015-09-28 }} Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (I&M)</ref>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:Bonaire-Flamingo-airport-2013.JPG|thumb|[[Flamingo International Airport|Flamingo Airport]]]]\n\nBonaire's first airport was located near Tra'i Monta\u00f1a Subi Blanku and crossed the current path of Kralendijk to Rincon and was built in 1936. The airport proved to be too small when American soldiers arrived on Bonaire in the second half of 1943. The commander stated that a new airport had to be built. Construction began in December 1943, with the new \"Flamingo Airport\" opening in 1945. A small terminal was built that was suitable for the number of passengers at the time. This building was used until mid-1976. The airport had received many extensions of both the runway and the terminal itself.\n\nToday the airport is known as [[Flamingo International Airport]] and is served by a variety of both domestic and international airlines. Services from the US include Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines. Airlines providing European service include TUI Netherlands and KLM. Consistent air service from Cura\u00e7ao is available through Divi Divi Air and EZ Air.\n\nThe airport is equipped with a fire station, control tower and hangar. Plans are underway for modifications to the current airport facilities, runway and the fire station.\n\n==Settlements==\n[[File:BONAIRE-rincon-1.jpg|thumb|[[St. Louis Bertrand Church (Bonaire)|St. Louis Bertrand Church]] in [[Rincon (Bonaire)|Rincon]]]]\n[[File:Old Malmok.jpg|thumb|The Old Malm\u00f6k lighthouse is in [[Washington Slagbaai National Park]].]]\n\nThe two towns on the island are [[Kralendijk]] (the capital) and [[Rincon (Bonaire)|Rincon]].\n\nKralendijk has many suburbs/ neighborhoods, although on an island with such a small population, the distinction is not always clearcut.

He also wrote a few books of poetry, and built a stage for exhibition of drama within his residence.\n\n\n\n==Social Work and Freedom Struggle==\nHemchandra Chowdhury left his home village of Ambaria in 1880, and built a Rajbari or palace in the village of Subarnkhali in the [[Jhawail Union|Jawail Union]] administrative area, in [[Gopalpur Upazila]]. In 1905, Chowdhury helped to develop the railways between towns and villages across Bangladesh, such as [[Mymensingh]]. This also improved links between the rural communities and major cities like [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Dhaka]]. He also built the first concrete road in Gopalpur Upazila, known as the Hemnagar-Gopalpur-Amberia road.\n\nHe was known as a benevolent king, and built roads, hospitals and bridges for the welfare of his people.

It was built on 20 acres of land, and is still open. He also donated a large amount of money to the [[University of Dhaka|Dhaka University]], and is one of ten donors inscribed onto the foundation of [[Anandamohan College|Anandamohon College]] in Calcutta.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, when there was an outbreak of [[malaria]] in Tangail, he distributed [[quinine]] medicine by post among the local people. To enable access to drinking water to the public, many wells and ponds were built at road junctions. He also built iron bridges for the pilgrims of the [[Chandranath Temple]] in [[Sitakunda]].[[File:Hemnagar Rajbari 02.jpg|thumb|Exterior view of the Hemnagar Rajbari, located in [[Gopalpur Upazila]].|alt=]]During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], the Hemnagar Rajbari was used as a shelter for freedom fighters, and helped with humanitarian aid.[[File: Hemnagar Rajbari 05.jpg|thumb|Pillars outside the Hemnagar Rajbari]]\n\n==Buildings==\nChowdhury constructed the Hemnagar Rajbari in 1890, a two-storied palace in Shimlapara, located three kilometres south-east of Subarnakhali. The palace was sometimes referred to as 'Parir Dalan', which translates to \"the Building of the Fairy\". The house is made up of 100 rooms, built of expensive glass imported from [[Delhi]] and Calcutta. It was built on 60 acres of land, and the property includes zoos, [[Durga Puja|Durja Puja]] [[pandal]]s and flower gardens. In the front palace there is a two-story theatre, and out the front there is a large pond with paved [[ghat]]s. He built bungalows near the Rajbari, with a 24-hour chowkidar (night watchman), and surrounded them with high walls with flower gardens inside. Here his relatives and British officials from Calcutta stayed, as well as entertained. The area it was built in was called '[[Hemnagar Union|Hemnagar]]', named after Chowdhury.

Shyamkanta Ganguly and his son Kamal Ganguly went to Hemnagar, but during the war of 1965, they also emigrated. During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh War of Liberation]], the Rajbari of Hemanagar was used as a shelter for the freedom fighters.\n\nHis descendants currently live in parts of Bangladesh and West Bengal. In West Bengal, they married into [[Kalibabur Bari|Maharaja (King) Kaliprasad Mukhopadhayay's family]] and the [[Tagore family]], of which [[Rabindranath Tagore]] became the first Asian to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nHis great-granddaughter, Indrani Roy (1943-2016), was part of the first generation of feminist Bengali poets writing after the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]], and one of the founding members of the Aurobindo Nari Chetana Mancha (The Aurobindo Society for Women's Empowerment), a feminist writers' society in Calcutta under the Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://safic.aurosociety.org/|title=Sri Aurobindo Foundation for Indian Culture (SAFIC)|website=safic.aurosociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}</ref> named after [[Sri Aurobindo]], the Indian political philosopher.

HDFS uses this method when replicating data for data redundancy across multiple racks. This approach reduces the impact of a rack power outage or switch failure; if any of these hardware failures occurs, the data will remain available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html |title=HDFS User Guide |publisher=Hadoop.apache.org |accessdate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n[[File:Hadoop 1.png|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Hadoop cluster|A multi-node Hadoop cluster]]\n\nA small Hadoop cluster includes a single master and multiple worker nodes.

HDFS is used for storing the data and MapReduce is used for processing the Data.\nHDFS has five services as follows:\n# Name Node\n# Secondary Name Node\n# Job tracker\n# Data Node\n# Task Tracker\n\nTop three are Master Services/Daemons/Nodes and bottom two are Slave Services. Master Services can communicate with each other and in the same way Slave services can communicate with each other. Name Node is a master node and Data node is its corresponding Slave node and can talk with each other.\n\n'''Name Node:''' HDFS consists of only one Name Node we call it as Master Node which can track the files, manage the file system and has the meta data and the whole data in it. To be particular Name node contains the details of the No. of blocks, Locations at what data node the data is stored and where the replications are stored and other details. As we have only one Name Node we call it as Single Point Failure. It has Direct connect with the client.\n\n'''Data Node:''' A Data Node stores data in it as the blocks. This is also known as the slave node and it stores the actual data into HDFS which is responsible for the client to read and write. These are slave daemons. Every Data node sends a Heartbeat message to the Name node every 3 seconds and conveys that it is alive. In this way when Name Node does not receive a heartbeat from a data node for 2 minutes, it will take that data node as dead and starts the process of block replications on some other Data node.\n\n'''Secondary Name Node:''' This is only to take care of the checkpoints of the file system metadata which is in the Name Node. This is also known as the checkpoint Node. It is helper Node for the Name Node.\n\n'''Job Tracker:''' Basically Job Tracker will be useful in the Processing the data. Job Tracker receives the requests for Map Reduce execution from the client. Job tracker talks to the Name node to know about the location of the data like Job Tracker will request the Name Node for the processing the data. Name node in response gives the Meta data to job tracker.\n\n'''Task Tracker:''' It is the Slave Node for the Job Tracker and it will take the task from the Job Tracker. And also it receives code from the Job Tracker. Task Tracker will take the code and apply on the file. The process of applying that code on the file is known as Mapper.<ref>https://HADOOP.APACHE.ORG/DOCS/R2.7.5/HADOOP-PROJECT-DIST/HADOOP-HDFS/HDFSUSERGUIDE.HTML</ref>\n\nHadoop cluster has nominally a single namenode plus a cluster of datanodes, although [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] options are available for the namenode due to its criticality. Each datanode serves up blocks of data over the network using a block protocol specific to HDFS. The file system uses [[TCP/IP]] [[Internet socket|sockets]] for communication. Clients use [[remote procedure call]]s (RPC) to communicate with each other.\n\nHDFS stores large files (typically in the range of gigabytes to terabytes<ref>{{cite web |title=HDFS Architecture |url=http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#Large_Data_Sets |accessdate=1 September 2013 }}</ref>) across multiple machines. It achieves reliability by [[Replication (computer science)|replicating]] the data across multiple hosts, and hence theoretically does not require [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks (RAID)]] storage on hosts (but to increase input-output (I/O) performance some RAID configurations are still useful). With the default replication value, 3, data is stored on three nodes: two on the same rack, and one on a different rack. Data nodes can talk to each other to rebalance data, to move copies around, and to keep the replication of data high. HDFS is not fully POSIX-compliant, because the requirements for a POSIX file-system differ from the target goals of a Hadoop application. The trade-off of not having a fully POSIX-compliant file-system is increased performance for data [[throughput]] and support for non-POSIX operations such as Append.<ref name=\"openlibrary1\">{{Cite journal|first = Yaniv |last = Pessach|title = Distributed Storage|edition = Distributed Storage: Concepts, Algorithms, and Implementations|date = 2013\n|ol = 25423189M }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, high-availability capabilities were added to HDFS,<ref name=\"failover\">{{cite web |title=Version 2.0 provides for manual failover and they are working on automatic failover |url=https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html#23+May%2C+2012%3A+Release+2.0.0-alpha+available  |accessdate= 30 July 2013 |publisher=Hadoop.apache.org }}</ref> letting the main metadata server called the NameNode manually fail-over onto a backup. The project has also started developing automatic [[fail-over]]s.\n\nThe HDFS file system includes a so-called ''secondary namenode'', a misleading term that some might incorrectly interpret as a backup namenode when the primary namenode goes offline. In fact, the secondary namenode regularly connects with the primary namenode and builds snapshots of the primary namenode's directory information, which the system then saves to local or remote directories. These checkpointed images can be used to restart a failed primary namenode without having to replay the entire journal of file-system actions, then to edit the log to create an up-to-date directory structure. Because the namenode is the single point for storage and management of metadata, it can become a bottleneck for supporting a huge number of files, especially a large number of small files. HDFS Federation, a new addition, aims to tackle this problem to a certain extent by allowing multiple namespaces served by separate namenodes. Moreover, there are some issues in HDFS such as small file issues, scalability problems, Single Point of Failure (SPoF), and bottlenecks in huge metadata requests.\nOne advantage of using HDFS is data awareness between the job tracker and task tracker. The job tracker schedules map or reduce jobs to task trackers with an awareness of the data location. For example: if node A contains data (a, b, c) and node X contains data (x, y, z), the job tracker schedules node A to perform map or reduce tasks on (a, b, c) and node X would be scheduled to perform map or reduce tasks on (x, y, z). This reduces the amount of traffic that goes over the network and prevents unnecessary data transfer. When Hadoop is used with other file systems, this advantage is not always available. This can have a significant impact on job-completion times as demonstrated with data-intensive jobs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~xqin/pubs/hcw10.pdf |title= Improving MapReduce performance through data placement in heterogeneous Hadoop Clusters |date=April 2010 |publisher=Eng.auburn.ed }}</ref>\n\nHDFS was designed for mostly immutable files and may not be suitable for systems requiring concurrent write operations.<ref name=\"openlibrary1\" />\n\nHDFS can be [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] directly with a [[Filesystem in Userspace]] (FUSE) [[virtual file system]] on [[Linux]] and some other [[Unix]] systems.\n\nFile access can be achieved through the native Java API, the [[Thrift (protocol)|Thrift]] API (generates a client in a number of languages e.g. C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], Smalltalk, and [[OCaml]]), the [[command-line interface]], the HDFS-UI [[web application]] over [[HTTP]], or via 3rd-party network client libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/MountableHDFS |title=Mounting HDFS |accessdate=2016-08-05 }}</ref>\n\nHDFS is designed for portability across various hardware platforms and for compatibility with a variety of underlying operating systems.

The JobTracker pushes work to available ''TaskTracker'' nodes in the cluster, striving to keep the work as close to the data as possible. With a rack-aware file system, the JobTracker knows which node contains the data, and which other machines are nearby. If the work cannot be hosted on the actual node where the data resides, priority is given to nodes in the same rack. This reduces network traffic on the main backbone network. If a TaskTracker fails or times out, that part of the job is rescheduled. The TaskTracker on each node spawns a separate [[Java virtual machine]] (JVM) process to prevent the TaskTracker itself from failing if the running job crashes its JVM. A heartbeat is sent from the TaskTracker to the JobTracker every few minutes to check its status. The Job Tracker and TaskTracker status and information is exposed by [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]] and can be viewed from a web browser.\n\nKnown limitations of this approach are:\n\n# The allocation of work to TaskTrackers is very simple. Every TaskTracker has a number of available ''slots'' (such as \"4 slots\"). Every active map or reduce task takes up one slot. The Job Tracker allocates work to the tracker nearest to the data with an available slot. There is no consideration of the current [[load (computing)|system load]] of the allocated machine, and hence its actual availability.\n# If one TaskTracker is very slow, it can delay the entire MapReduce job{{snd}} especially towards the end, when everything can end up waiting for the slowest task. With speculative execution enabled, however, a single task can be executed on multiple slave nodes.\n\n====Scheduling====\nBy default Hadoop uses [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] scheduling, and optionally 5 scheduling priorities to schedule jobs from a work queue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/commands_manual.html|title=Commands Guide|date=17 August 2011|accessdate=11 December 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817053520/http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/commands_manual.html#job|archivedate=17 August 2011}}</ref> In version 0.19 the job scheduler was refactored out of the JobTracker, while adding the ability to use an alternate scheduler (such as the ''Fair scheduler'' or the ''Capacity scheduler'', described next).<ref>{{cite web |title=Refactor the scheduler out of the JobTracker |url=https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3412 |work=Hadoop Common |publisher=Apache Software Foundation |accessdate=9 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=====Fair scheduler=====\nThe fair scheduler was developed by [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-hadoop-scheduling/ |title=Scheduling in Hadoop |first=M.

It runs two d\u00e6mons, which take care of two different tasks: the ''resource manager'', which does job tracking and resource allocation to applications, the ''application master'', which monitors progress of the execution.\n\n===Difference between Hadoop 2 and Hadoop 3===\nThere are important features provided by Hadoop 3. For example, while there is one single ''namenode'' in Hadoop 2, Hadoop 3 enables having multiple name nodes, which solves the single point of failure problem.\n\nIn Hadoop 3, there are containers working in principle of [[Docker (software)|Docker]], which reduces time spent on application development.\n\nOne of the biggest changes is that Hadoop 3 decreases storage overhead with [[Erasure code|erasure coding]].\n\nAlso, Hadoop 3 permits usage of GPU hardware within the cluster, which is a very substantial benefit to execute deep learning algorithms on a Hadoop cluster.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://it.hortonworks.com/blog/hadoop-3-adds-value-hadoop-2/ |title=How Apache Hadoop 3 Adds Value Over Apache Hadoop 2 |website=hortonworks.com |accessdate=2018-06-11|date=7 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\nThe HDFS file system is not restricted to MapReduce jobs.

HDFS uses this method when replicating data for data redundancy across multiple racks. This approach reduces the impact of a rack power outage or switch failure; if any of these hardware failures occurs, the data will remain available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html |title=HDFS User Guide |publisher=Hadoop.apache.org |accessdate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n[[File:Hadoop 1.png|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Hadoop cluster|A multi-node Hadoop cluster]]\n\nA small Hadoop cluster includes a single master and multiple worker nodes.

Master Services can communicate with each other and in the same way Slave services can communicate with each other. Name Node is a master node and Data node is its corresponding Slave node and can talk with each other.\n\n'''Name Node:''' HDFS consists of only one Name Node we call it as Master Node which can track the files, manage the file system and has the meta data and the whole data in it. To be particular Name node contains the details of the No. of blocks, Locations at what data node the data is stored and where the replications are stored and other details. As we have only one Name Node we call it as Single Point Failure. It has Direct connect with the client.\n\n'''Data Node:''' A Data Node stores data in it as the blocks. This is also known as the slave node and it stores the actual data into HDFS which is responsible for the client to read and write. These are slave daemons. Every Data node sends a Heartbeat message to the Name node every 3 seconds and conveys that it is alive. In this way when Name Node does not receive a heartbeat from a data node for 2 minutes, it will take that data node as dead and starts the process of block replications on some other Data node.\n\n'''Secondary Name Node:''' This is only to take care of the checkpoints of the file system metadata which is in the Name Node. This is also known as the checkpoint Node. It is helper Node for the Name Node.\n\n'''Job Tracker:''' Basically Job Tracker will be useful in the Processing the data. Job Tracker receives the requests for Map Reduce execution from the client. Job tracker talks to the Name node to know about the location of the data like Job Tracker will request the Name Node for the processing the data. Name node in response gives the Meta data to job tracker.\n\n'''Task Tracker:''' It is the Slave Node for the Job Tracker and it will take the task from the Job Tracker. And also it receives code from the Job Tracker. Task Tracker will take the code and apply on the file. The process of applying that code on the file is known as Mapper.<ref>https://HADOOP.APACHE.ORG/DOCS/R2.7.5/HADOOP-PROJECT-DIST/HADOOP-HDFS/HDFSUSERGUIDE.HTML</ref>\n\nHadoop cluster has nominally a single namenode plus a cluster of datanodes, although [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] options are available for the namenode due to its criticality. Each datanode serves up blocks of data over the network using a block protocol specific to HDFS. The file system uses [[TCP/IP]] [[Internet socket|sockets]] for communication. Clients use [[remote procedure call]]s (RPC) to communicate with each other.\n\nHDFS stores large files (typically in the range of gigabytes to terabytes<ref>{{cite web |title=HDFS Architecture |url=http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#Large_Data_Sets |accessdate=1 September 2013 }}</ref>) across multiple machines. It achieves reliability by [[Replication (computer science)|replicating]] the data across multiple hosts, and hence theoretically does not require [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks (RAID)]] storage on hosts (but to increase input-output (I/O) performance some RAID configurations are still useful). With the default replication value, 3, data is stored on three nodes: two on the same rack, and one on a different rack. Data nodes can talk to each other to rebalance data, to move copies around, and to keep the replication of data high. HDFS is not fully POSIX-compliant, because the requirements for a POSIX file-system differ from the target goals of a Hadoop application. The trade-off of not having a fully POSIX-compliant file-system is increased performance for data [[throughput]] and support for non-POSIX operations such as Append.<ref name=\"openlibrary1\">{{Cite journal|first = Yaniv |last = Pessach|title = Distributed Storage|edition = Distributed Storage: Concepts, Algorithms, and Implementations|date = 2013\n|ol = 25423189M }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, high-availability capabilities were added to HDFS,<ref name=\"failover\">{{cite web |title=Version 2.0 provides for manual failover and they are working on automatic failover |url=https://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html#23+May%2C+2012%3A+Release+2.0.0-alpha+available  |accessdate= 30 July 2013 |publisher=Hadoop.apache.org }}</ref> letting the main metadata server called the NameNode manually fail-over onto a backup. The project has also started developing automatic [[fail-over]]s.\n\nThe HDFS file system includes a so-called ''secondary namenode'', a misleading term that some might incorrectly interpret as a backup namenode when the primary namenode goes offline. In fact, the secondary namenode regularly connects with the primary namenode and builds snapshots of the primary namenode's directory information, which the system then saves to local or remote directories. These checkpointed images can be used to restart a failed primary namenode without having to replay the entire journal of file-system actions, then to edit the log to create an up-to-date directory structure. Because the namenode is the single point for storage and management of metadata, it can become a bottleneck for supporting a huge number of files, especially a large number of small files. HDFS Federation, a new addition, aims to tackle this problem to a certain extent by allowing multiple namespaces served by separate namenodes. Moreover, there are some issues in HDFS such as small file issues, scalability problems, Single Point of Failure (SPoF), and bottlenecks in huge metadata requests.\nOne advantage of using HDFS is data awareness between the job tracker and task tracker. The job tracker schedules map or reduce jobs to task trackers with an awareness of the data location. For example: if node A contains data (a, b, c) and node X contains data (x, y, z), the job tracker schedules node A to perform map or reduce tasks on (a, b, c) and node X would be scheduled to perform map or reduce tasks on (x, y, z). This reduces the amount of traffic that goes over the network and prevents unnecessary data transfer. When Hadoop is used with other file systems, this advantage is not always available. This can have a significant impact on job-completion times as demonstrated with data-intensive jobs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~xqin/pubs/hcw10.pdf |title= Improving MapReduce performance through data placement in heterogeneous Hadoop Clusters |date=April 2010 |publisher=Eng.auburn.ed }}</ref>\n\nHDFS was designed for mostly immutable files and may not be suitable for systems requiring concurrent write operations.<ref name=\"openlibrary1\" />\n\nHDFS can be [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] directly with a [[Filesystem in Userspace]] (FUSE) [[virtual file system]] on [[Linux]] and some other [[Unix]] systems.\n\nFile access can be achieved through the native Java API, the [[Thrift (protocol)|Thrift]] API (generates a client in a number of languages e.g. C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], Smalltalk, and [[OCaml]]), the [[command-line interface]], the HDFS-UI [[web application]] over [[HTTP]], or via 3rd-party network client libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/MountableHDFS |title=Mounting HDFS |accessdate=2016-08-05 }}</ref>\n\nHDFS is designed for portability across various hardware platforms and for compatibility with a variety of underlying operating systems.

To reduce network traffic, Hadoop needs to know which servers are closest to the data, information that Hadoop-specific file system bridges can provide.\n\nIn May 2011, the list of supported file systems bundled with Apache Hadoop were:\n\n* HDFS: Hadoop's own rack-aware file system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html#Rack_Awareness |title=HDFS Users Guide&nbsp;\u2013 Rack Awareness |publisher=Hadoop.apache.org |accessdate=2013-10-17 }}</ref> This is designed to scale to tens of petabytes of storage and runs on top of the file systems of the underlying [[operating system]]s.\n* [[FTP]] file system: This stores all its data on remotely accessible FTP servers.\n* [[Amazon Simple Storage Service|Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)]] object storage: This is targeted at clusters hosted on the [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]] server-on-demand infrastructure.

The JobTracker pushes work to available ''TaskTracker'' nodes in the cluster, striving to keep the work as close to the data as possible. With a rack-aware file system, the JobTracker knows which node contains the data, and which other machines are nearby. If the work cannot be hosted on the actual node where the data resides, priority is given to nodes in the same rack. This reduces network traffic on the main backbone network. If a TaskTracker fails or times out, that part of the job is rescheduled. The TaskTracker on each node spawns a separate [[Java virtual machine]] (JVM) process to prevent the TaskTracker itself from failing if the running job crashes its JVM. A heartbeat is sent from the TaskTracker to the JobTracker every few minutes to check its status. The Job Tracker and TaskTracker status and information is exposed by [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]] and can be viewed from a web browser.\n\nKnown limitations of this approach are:\n\n# The allocation of work to TaskTrackers is very simple. Every TaskTracker has a number of available ''slots'' (such as \"4 slots\"). Every active map or reduce task takes up one slot. The Job Tracker allocates work to the tracker nearest to the data with an available slot. There is no consideration of the current [[load (computing)|system load]] of the allocated machine, and hence its actual availability.\n# If one TaskTracker is very slow, it can delay the entire MapReduce job{{snd}} especially towards the end, when everything can end up waiting for the slowest task. With speculative execution enabled, however, a single task can be executed on multiple slave nodes.\n\n====Scheduling====\nBy default Hadoop uses [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] scheduling, and optionally 5 scheduling priorities to schedule jobs from a work queue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/commands_manual.html|title=Commands Guide|date=17 August 2011|accessdate=11 December 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817053520/http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/commands_manual.html#job|archivedate=17 August 2011}}</ref> In version 0.19 the job scheduler was refactored out of the JobTracker, while adding the ability to use an alternate scheduler (such as the ''Fair scheduler'' or the ''Capacity scheduler'', described next).<ref>{{cite web |title=Refactor the scheduler out of the JobTracker |url=https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-3412 |work=Hadoop Common |publisher=Apache Software Foundation |accessdate=9 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=====Fair scheduler=====\nThe fair scheduler was developed by [[Facebook]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-hadoop-scheduling/ |title=Scheduling in Hadoop |first=M.

The capacity scheduler supports several features that are similar to those of the fair scheduler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable1/capacity_scheduler.html|title=CapacityScheduler Guide|website=Hadoop.apache.org|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n# Queues are allocated a fraction of the total resource capacity.\n# Free resources are allocated to queues beyond their total capacity.\n# Within a queue, a job with a high level of priority has access to the queue's resources.\n\nThere is no [[preemption (computing)|preemption]] once a job is running.\n\n===Difference between Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 (YARN)===\nThe biggest difference between Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 is the addition of YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which replaced the MapReduce engine in the first version of Hadoop.\nYARN strives to allocate resources to various applications effectively. It runs two d\u00e6mons, which take care of two different tasks: the ''resource manager'', which does job tracking and resource allocation to applications, the ''application master'', which monitors progress of the execution.\n\n===Difference between Hadoop 2 and Hadoop 3===\nThere are important features provided by Hadoop 3. For example, while there is one single ''namenode'' in Hadoop 2, Hadoop 3 enables having multiple name nodes, which solves the single point of failure problem.\n\nIn Hadoop 3, there are containers working in principle of [[Docker (software)|Docker]], which reduces time spent on application development.\n\nOne of the biggest changes is that Hadoop 3 decreases storage overhead with [[Erasure code|erasure coding]].\n\nAlso, Hadoop 3 permits usage of GPU hardware within the cluster, which is a very substantial benefit to execute deep learning algorithms on a Hadoop cluster.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://it.hortonworks.com/blog/hadoop-3-adds-value-hadoop-2/ |title=How Apache Hadoop 3 Adds Value Over Apache Hadoop 2 |website=hortonworks.com |accessdate=2018-06-11|date=7 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\nThe HDFS file system is not restricted to MapReduce jobs.

Hadoop can, in theory, be used for any sort of work that is batch-oriented rather than real-time, is very data-intensive, and benefits from parallel processing of data.

It originally aired on April 3, 2002. The episode parodies actor [[Russell Crowe]]'s real-life altercations. In the episode, the boys must watch his show in order to watch a teaser for an upcoming [[List of recurring South Park characters#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]] movie. However, bad luck forces them to race across town searching for a working TV.\n\n==Plot ==\n[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] are at Stan's house to see ''Fightin' Around the World with [[Russell Crowe]]''. The boys do not actually care about the show, but watch it solely to see the new [[List of recurring South Park characters#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]] movie trailer, which will premiere during one of the show's [[Television advertisement|commercial breaks]]. [[List of South Park families#Shelly Marsh|Shelly]], Stan's aggressive older sister, being on her period, only allows them to watch if they bring her some tampons; the boys sent out Butters to get some. Cartman thinks the TV's color are \"[[Colorfulness|saturated]]\" and attempts to fix a loose cable, causing the TV to explode. After Butters returns, the boys leave to watch at Kyle's house, forcing his little brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] away from the TV. Their father, [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Gerald]], reprimands Kyle for not letting Ike watch the ''[[PBS NewsHour|MacNeil/Lehrer Report]]'', forcing the boys to find another place to watch the show.\n\nThroughout the episode, several parts of ''Fightin' Around the World with Russell Crowe'' are shown. This \"children's show\" depicts Crowe as a muscular sailor with an exaggerated Australian accent who randomly beats people up. He sails the world with Tugger, his [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[tugboat]] who communicates with him by exhuming fumes, and who Crowe considers his best friend. Throughout the show, Crowe and Tugger visit several places, including [[Tiananmen Square]] in [[China]] and [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. Crowe describes the locals there in a wildlife documentary style similar to such shows as ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]'' and ''[[Man vs. Wild]]'', then proceeds to pick fights with them. At one point, Crowe also attacks the show's editor for cutting one of the fighting scenes short. Later on, Crowe sings Tugger a song from his new album, accompanying himself on his acoustic guitar. The song is so horrible that it drives Tugger to do a suicide attempt. He is brought to the hospital and makes a full recovery.\n\nThe boys discuss where they can find a television to watch the commercial breaks on. Cartman's house is being [[Fumigation|fumigated]] and Butters insists they cannot go to his house, so they go to [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] to watch on his new, hyper-modern plasma screen TV. To their disappointment, the trailer is not shown during the first commercial break. When Chef tries to demonstrate some of the functionalities of his new TV, he accidentally transforms it into an [[RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209]]-like robot, which goes on a rampage through South Park. During the remainder of the episode, Chef follows the destructive television around while talking to customer service on his cellphone in an effort to deprogram the machine. The boys go to watch TV at the local bar, only to be kicked out for being underage. They then arrive at Shady Acres, South Park's retirement home, where they manage to catch the second commercial break, but the trailer is again not aired. The elderly grow annoyed with the boys and force them out by simultaneously defecating.\n\nIn desperation, they try to brave the fumes at Cartman's house, but this proves unbearable. The boys decide to head back to Stan's house to use an old black-and-white television which Stan remembers having. Upon arriving at the front door, Butters realizes he never gave Shelly her tampons. Before they can enter the house, they are washed away by a large tidal wave of Shelly's menstrual blood. The boys then resort to watching TV with a group of crack-addicted homeless people, only to be attacked by Chef's rampaging television-robot which blasts away the device. With nowhere else to go, the boys ask Butters why they cannot watch at his house. Butters explains that his parents are out of town and he does not have a babysitter. Stunned for a few seconds by this revelation, they hurriedly rush to Butters' house (with Stan saying: \"We'll kill Butters later!\"), arriving just in time to view the last commercial break, wherein the trailer is finally shown. The trailer is [[Climax (rhetoric)#Anticlimax|anti-climactic]]: it features a textual announcement in the form of words flying at the screen, followed by a few seconds of Terrance and Phillip at a ranch wearing cowboy hats and farting. It shows almost nothing of the actual film. Nevertheless, the boys are ecstatic over finally getting to see the trailer after all.\n\nMeanwhile, Chef is still on the phone with the customer service line, unsuccessfully trying to stop his TV.\n\n==Inspiration and production==\nBetween 1999 and 2002, Russell Crowe was involved in a few altercations, which are spoofed in the ''South Park'' episode.

You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle!\"\n\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode, Trey Parker noted that, by 2002, Crowe had gotten himself into fights on three different continents, which led to the idea of ''Fightin' Around the World with Russell Crowe'', since Crowe had literally fought all over the world. Parker said that the initial inspiration for the episode, however, came from a personal experience he and Matt Stone had with the actor. Parker and Stone got to know Crowe at an award show around the time that the duo got awards for ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut|Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. They described Crowe as \"a really cool guy\" accompanied by easy-going \"[[Aussie]]\" friends. One day, the two were invited to the studio by Crowe, who was finishing his album and asked the duo to listen to it and provide feedback. Flattered, they accepted the invitation. However, when they arrived, about eight of Crowe's acquaintances were also there. Crowe then proceeded to play a CD of the album, which seemed completely mixed and finished already. No one in the room seemed willing to comment on the songs, and it soon became apparent to Parker and Stone that Crowe simply wanted everyone to sit there and listen to the album. Parker said that while Crowe was \"a very talented ''actor''\", he was a poor musician, describing his record as \"[[Bon Jovi]] meets [[Hepatitis B]]\". At one point, a song came along which featured handclapping. Parker, trying to think of something constructive to say, suggested that Crowe mix out the handclaps. \"And literally, the place just got quiet\", Parker said, with all attendees supposedly in shock that Parker would dare to critique Crowe.
