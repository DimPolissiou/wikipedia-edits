One day, Li poured sesame oil onto his noodles accidentally, and he boiled those noodles then added shallot and other condiments on the next day and sold them on next morning.

Chili oil is usually used in the seasoning of hot dry noodles as well as a bit of fresh coriander.\n\n==Origin==\nThe summer time in Wuhan is extremely long, and the high temperature causes food's rapid deterioration. As a result, people added dietary alkali into noodles to avoid deterioration, that is the predecessor of hot dry noodles.\n\nA widely circulated rumor is, in the early 1930s, there was a small food stand operated by Bao Li, a hawker who made a living by selling bean noodles and noodle soups near a temple in [[Hankou]]. One day, Li poured sesame oil onto his noodles accidentally, and he boiled those noodles then added shallot and other condiments on the next day and sold them on next morning. His noodles became very popular because of its unique taste, and customers asked Bao Li what kind of noodle it is, Bao Li answered: Hot dry noodles.<ref>Anderson, E. N. (1990/09/10).

It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the [[crested bobwhite]], ''Colinus cristatus''. As the latter species expands north into [[Costa Rica]], it is likely that the two species will overlap in range in the future, but the Costa Rican [[subspecies]] of the spot-bellied is the least similar to the crested.\n\nThe spot-bellied bobwhite occurs in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]],  [[Nicaragua]] and Costa Rica in open [[savanna]] with bushes and trees and other open woodland.\n\n==Description==\nThis species is 22\u201324&nbsp;cm long and shows geographically variable male plumage amongst its six subspecies. All forms have a brown back with black spotting on the nape. The head has a white [[supercilium]], a dark line through the eye, a white or brown throat and a short crest. The lower belly is spotted but the rest of the underparts are pale, entirely spotted, or spotted with a rufous chest depending on the subspecies. The male weighs 140 g on average. The female is duller than the male with a buff supercilium and mottled throat; her average weight is 115&nbsp;g.\n\nThe song, most often given by males in spring and summer, is a rising, scratchy, ''bob-Wight!'' or ''bob-bob-White!''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThere are 6 recognised subspecies.\n\nThe subspecies in North West Honduras is known as ''Colinus leucopogon leylandi'' (Moore, 1859). The [[Type_(biology)|holotype specimen]] of \u201c''Ortyx leylandi''\u201d [https://www.nature.com/articles/110641a0 Moore] ([https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32274468 Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1859, p.62.]) is held in the collections of [[National Museums Liverpool]] at [[World Museum]], with accession number 1989.66.19. The specimen was collected from \u201cFlores, on the road from [[Omoa]] to Comayagua\u201d, Honduras, and purchased for the museum from Mr Leyland on 9th November 1857.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe spot-bellied bobwhite forms \"coveys\", groups of three to 15 birds during the non-breeding season. Both males and females incubate nests, with most nests predominantly incubated by females. About 10 white eggs are laid. The chicks are [[precocial]] and will leave the nest few hours after hatching.\n\nThis shy species feeds on seeds and insects, the latter especially during the breeding season. It is most active in the early morning and evening.\n\n==References==\n* Madge and McGowan, ''Pheasants, Partridges and Grouse'' {{ISBN|0-7136-3966-0}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1944830}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:bobwhite, spot-bellied}}\n[[Category:Colinus|spot-bellied bobwhite]]\n[[Category:Birds of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Birds of El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Birds of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Birds of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Birds of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1842|spot-bellied bobwhite]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Species of bird}}\n{{speciesbox\n| name = Spot-bellied bobwhite\n| image = Colinus leucopogon 1849.jpg\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| genus = Colinus\n| species = leucopogon\n| authority = ([[Ren\u00e9-Primev\u00e8re Lesson|Lesson]], 1842)\n}}\n\nThe '''spot-bellied bobwhite''' (''Colinus leucopogon'') is a ground-dwelling [[bird]] in the [[New World quail]] family.
